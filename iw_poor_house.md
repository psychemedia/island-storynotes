ISLE OF WIGHT.

THE Poor belonging to the various parllhes in the Ifle of Wight arc chiefly relreved ataHoufe of Induflry fituated near the town of Newport. It was ercdled under the authority of an Adi of Parliament paffed in .1 771 whereby 80 acres of the foreft of Parkhurfl; were veiled in the gentlemen of the ifland for the 'term of 999 years, under the title of the Corporation or Guardians of the Poor of the Ifle of Wight; and, in order that each parilh might contribute it's fair proportion, an account was taken of the amount of their refpedlive Poor's Rates for the preceding 7 years, and, according to the average, the ratio of their future payments was determined on; fo that thofe parllhes, whofe parochial charges were the heavieft at the time of the valuation, are now burthened with the greatell: quota towards the confolidated fund. One pays 2s. in the pound on the rack rent; another, ijd,; and a third, 3s. 3d. in the pound upon twothirds of the rent. The Corporation was authorized to borrow 12,000. for the purpofe of ereding the Houfe of Induflry; but this fum being found inadequate to complete the defign, a fecond application was made to Parliament, and by an Ad palTed in 1 776, the Corporation was empowered to borrow an additional fum not exceeding jTS 000.; and as the provifions of the former Ad had been found by experience to be extremely defedive, the whole was repealed, and new powers and regulations provided \

The members of the Corporation are fiich inhabitants of the ifland as are feifed in fee, or for life, or of leafehold upon lives, in their own or their wives* right, of lands or property rated to the Poor's Rate at jfyo. a year; heirs apparent to property rated at 00. a year; all redors and vicars of the ifland; and all occupiers of lands or property rated at 100. whether in one or more pariflies within the ifland. On the laft Thurfday in June, in every year, 24 diredors, (of whom 12 are to be ſuch as were not diredors in the preceding year,) are eleded by the Corporation from their own body; proper  perſons for ading guardians are iikewife nominated in each pariſh by the Inhabitants alTelTed to the Poor's Rate, and lifts tranfmitted to the diredors, from which reprefentatives for each

A clerk and other neceffiu y officers are likewife appointed. The diredors and guardians are divided into quarterly,, monthly, and w'eekly committees, the laft of which confid of 2 diredors and 5 ading ‘guardians. They meet at the houſe every Saturday, to fettle the governor and ftew^ards' accounts of the preceding w'eek, to give diredions for the enfuing week, to hear complaints, to grant occafional relief to  perſons out of the houſe, and to attend to ſuch cafes as require immediate invelligation.

And when ſuch earnings do neceffarily fall (hort of fix (hillings a week, merely on account of the unfeafonablenefs of the weather, (as in deep fnow or hard frofts,) the deficiency may be made up to that fum, for a man who has a family to maintain.

he prefertt ftate of the inftitution to be very unneceflary. The dIre£lor$ and guardians are very regular in their attendance on committee days, &c.; and only one inftance occurs in the annexed accounts of a fine having been paid by either a guardian or diredor, during the laft 3 years.

59, That every quarterly committee of accounts ſhall examine into all the accounts of the preceding quarter, and Hiall prepare them for publication, and after they have thoroughly examined them, they fliall fet their hands to the fame : and the feparate articles of the incidental expences, paid by the governor, ftiall be entered in the quarterly account-book, in the fame manner as the bills, &c.; and no bills or falaries of olEcers fliall be paid by the treafurer, till a printed order be produced, figned by the chairman of the committee of accounts. i5i, That any fum, not exceeding twelve shillings, may be allowed for the burial of any poor  perſon dying out of the houſe, on application being made to the next weekly committee, or to a magiflrate, on oath, that the deceafed did not leave effedts fufEcient for defraying funeral cxpcnces : but that nothing fliall be allowed when the  perſon is not buried at the foie expencc of the corporation, and in the ufual manner of ſuch paupers; of which the officiating clergyman is defired to give a certificate.

70, That when it ffiall be found neceffiary to make ufe of any part, or the whole, of the fund of one thousand pounds, which has been raifed from the favings of the average rates, and is vefted on bond from the treafurer, to anfwer any extraordinary demands the great extent of the buildings, and the various articles of furniture may require, beyond what can be fpared for the fame, from the average rates in any one year : ſuch fum, fo ufed, ffiall be re-placed from the firft favings that may be afterwards made.

The principal part of the building Is 300 feet in length from eaft to weft, by 37 wide in the clear; having windows on both fides, for the advantage of a thorough draught of air : at the diftance of 200 feet from the weft end, a wing from the main building ranges fouthward, 170 feet by 24; from the cud of which, are built work-ffiops for the manufadurers and mechanics; and thefe, with a walk on the weft, form a fquare of 200 feet by 1 70.


On the eaft fide of the wing is a court, 170 feet by 50, formed by offices on the north; ſuch as dairy, walh-houſe,. brew-houſe, wood-houfc, ftore rooms, See. and a wall on the fouth. In the principal building Is a large ftore-room, Reward's room, dining hall-, 1 18 feet long by 27 wide, and a common fitting room, for the impotent and aged poor.

Under the eafl: end there are cellars for beer, meat. See. Over this building are the governor's and matron's lodging rooms, the laundry, nurferie?^ and fick wards*

In the wing on the ground floor are die fchool rooms, apothecary's fhop, kitchen, fcullery, bake-houſe, bread-room, governor's and matron's fitting room, and pantry; and over are the lying-in rooms, fick wards, and 20 feparate rooms or apartments for married men and their wives, with two common fitting rooms adjoining, for the old and infirm, who are unable to go dov/n flairs. In front of the principal building is a large gate-way; on the eaft fide of which is a mafter weaver's room, and fpinning room; 96 feet long by 1 8 wide, with flore-rooms over it; at the weft fide of this gate- way are the flioe-maker's and tailor's fhops, with a fpinning room, 150 feet long by 18 wide, with weaving rooms and florerooms over;

The chapelfis ereded on the north fide of the principal building: over it is a ftore-room. Four hundred yards diftance is a peft-houſe, with a burying ground, walled in, clofe adjoiningi

To the north of the peft-houſe a building has been lately eredled for the admiflion of  perſons under inoculation : it confifts of four roomSj each of about 15 feet by 14. On the fouth is a large garden, which fupplies the houſe with vegetables. On the eaft, behind the offices, are placed -the hog-flies^ barn, ftable, and other out-houſes*.

The houſe can.accommodate 700 people : the number of inmates;, how* ever, feldom exceeds 550. The following is a lift of the prefent inmates: they amount to 495. ‘ (3d of April, 1796.)

86 men; from. 20, to 90. years of age, confifting of cripples,, bllnd^ idiots, lunatics, &c.

1 15 women; from 20 to 90 years of age; of whom the. younger part; are blind, &c. or fent hither in cafes of baftardy.

* Warner's Hamplhire, iii. 73.

131 boys; from Infants to 13 years; among whom are many cripples, who are ufually employed under the tailors, or fhoc-makers, in the houſe; or in knitting, &c. according to their ftrength, and ability.

163 girls; from infants to 13 years; cripples, &c. fome of whom can fpin worRed, yarn, or flax.

The manufadfure carried on in the houſe chiefly confifts in making facks for coal, flour, and bifcuit; befides which, linfey, kerfeys, and other articles of that nature, are made, principally, for the ufe of the houſe. The quantity of each, annually manufaiStured during the laft 3 years, and in the years ending at midfummer 1783, may be feen in the annexed accounts; which alfo fpecify the falaries paid to the governor, matron, and other officers.

The baptifms in the houſe, during the laft 3 years were: 20 — 12 — 12 : and the burials, 68 — 32 — 61.

The number of regular out-penfioners is, at prefent, 44 : they receive, each, from is. to 3s. a week. The number of cafual weekly poor, and the amount of cafual weekly allowances, is very fluduating; and depends much on the feverity of the weather, and other circumftances. In January, and February, 1 793, the reliefs granted on Saturdays, amounted, for feveral weeks, to 130. ^ 150. jT 170. and upwards. Laft winter the weekly reliefs, granted on Saturdays, w^ere from ^ 9. to jT 17.

The debt paid off amounts to £ 5250. : the debt now owing is ^ 12,200. The land belonging to the corporation, amounting to near 80 acres, is laid down in a grafs farm. The produce is fold by a manager, and the receipts placed to the general account of the houſe.

The following ftatements of the receipts and expenditure for 4 years, are copied from printed papers, which are annually prepared and laid be* fore the corporation. They are, drawn up with great perfpicuity and accuracy, and afford a clearer view of the various circumftances conne^fed with this inftitution, than any general obfervations could convey. Perhaps but few improvements could be made in the mode of framing up this annual amount; but I would venture to fuggeft to the guardians, that the quantity of flax, hemp, wool, and other materials purchafed, fhould be particularized, as well as the fums paid for them. The public would thereby be enabled to judge whether a houſe of induftry bought their raw

materials dearer or cheaper than a common manufacturer. It Is like wife extremely defirable that the average number of men, women, and children, in the houſe, each month in the year, fhould be annexed to tlie account, as is done, (in a general manner,) at St. Peter's hofpital in BriftoT; and that the average number of men, women, and children, employed weekly, or monthly, in the manufactory, and cf the goods actually manufactured in the year, fhould be printed : it is only from comparing ſuch particulars, with the amount of expenditure, that a fair eftimatc can be formed of the work annually performed in a houſe of induftry, and of the annual charge attending the maintenance of a Pauper, under thefe inflitutions.

The following table is extrated from the Returns made to Parliament

in 1786 : [accounts follow]
