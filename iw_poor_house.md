TO DO

ISLE OF WIGHT.

THE Poor belonging to the various parishes in the Isle of Wight are chiefly relieved at a House of Industry situated near the town of Newport. It was erected under the authority of an Act of Parliament passed in 1771 whereby 80 acres of the forest of Parkhurst were veiled in the gentlemen of the island for the term of 999 years, under the title of the Corporation or Guardians of the Poor of the Isle of Wight; and, in order that each parish might contribute it's fair proportion, an account was taken of the amount of their respective Poor's Rates for the preceding 7 years, and, according to the average, the ratio of their future payments was determined on; so that those parishes, whose parochial charges were the heaviest at the time of the valuation, are now burthened with the greatest quota towards the consolidated fund. One pays 2s. in the pound on the rack rent; another, ijd,; and a third, 3s. 3d. in the pound upon two-thirds of the rent. The Corporation was authorized to borrow 12,000. for the purpose of erecting the House of Industry; but this sum being found inadequate to complete the design, a second application was made to Parliament, and by an Act passed in 1776, the Corporation was empowered to borrow an additional sum not exceeding jTs 000.; and as the provisions of the former Act had been found by experience to be extremely defective, the whole was repealed, and new powers and regulations provided \

The members of the Corporation are such inhabitants of the island as are feifed in fee, or for life, or of leasehold upon lives, in their own or their wives' right, of lands or property rated to the Poor's Rate at jfyo. a year; heirs apparent to property rated at 00. a year; all redors and vicars of the island; and all occupiers of lands or property rated at 100. whether in one or more parishes within the island. On the last Thursday in June, in every year, 24 directors, (of whom 12 are to be such as were not directors in the preceding year,) are elected by the Corporation from their own body; proper  persons for acting guardians are likewise nominated in each parish by the Inhabitants alTelTed to the Poor's Rate, and lits transmitted to the directors, from which representatives for each

• • * t

* ir Geo. 3. c. 43. * i<5 Geo. 3. c, 53. f. 2.

parishes (according to the proportion they pay towards the Poor's Rate,) are chosen by ballot, to make up the number of 36 acting guardians, who continue in office one year. A clerk and other necessary officers are likewise appointed. The directors and guardians are divided into quarterly, monthly, and weekly committees, the last of which consist of 2 directors and 5 acting guardians. They meet at the house every saturday, to settle the governor and afterwards accounts of the preceding week, to give directions for the ensuing week, to hear complaints, to grant occasional relief to persons out of the house, and to attend to such cases as require immediate investigation. The following are the most material of the bye-laws enacted by the Corporation for the regulation and government of the House of Industry;

1, That all poor  persons, single or married, without families, who are unable to maintain themselves, be taken into the house, and not supported out of it by any fettled allowance or pension.

2, That all poor  persons, whose families are too large to be maintained by their owm labour, may offer one or more of their, children, to he received into the house, at the discretion of the weekly committee,.

4, That poor  persons received into the house, for temporary relief only, shall not be deprived of their household goods, furniture or other property. But such wearing apparel, and other goods, as any pauper may bring into the house, shall be deemed and taken to be the property of the guardians of the poor, during the time such  person shall be maintained in the house.

6, That a weekly committee may grant to the use of any poor labourer's wife, on the birth of a fourth, fifth, or sixth child, the respective sums of five shillings, seven shillings and sixpence, or ten shillings and sixpence, according as he may then have living, four, five, or six children, under fourteen years of age; but, that five shillings thereof be applied, by the overseer, to the payment of the midwife,

7, That one churchwarden, or overseer of the poor, of every parish, he obliged to apply to the weekly committee on every sitting, either in  person, or by a director, or acting guardian, and to report, (after due enquiry made by himself, at the respective dwellings of the poor,) the number and ages of the family, and other circumstances, including the place of settlement, as well as the Illness of all persons in his parish, who may ask for, or Hand in need of, relief, under the penalty of any sum, not less than forty shillings, and not exceeding five pounds, as directed by the Act; but that relief may be granted to any pauper, who may be in the same manner reported by the surgeon, a director, or acting guardian.

8, That in case of an application wherein the preceding regulation hath not been adhered to, the committee, if it see proper, may entrust a director, or acting guardian, or the surgeon, with an order of relief, to be delivered, or not, to the pauper, according as the  person, thus entrusted, may find the circumstances of the case; or the committee may order the surgeon, or parish-officer, to visit the said pauper, and to make a report, as before required, to the next committee, which may then give relief from the time of the first application.

11, That the weekly committee, on application of an overseer, may grant monthly relief out of the house to the families of men impressed Into the sea-service, during their continuance as impressed men, not exceeding the sum of one shilling and sixpence a week, for two children under the age of ten years; the sum of two shillings a week, for three such children; and the sum of three shillings a week, for four such; to be paid weekly by the respective overseers, who are required to stop payment on the death or discharge of any such man, and report the state of the family to the next weekly committee; and that this proportion of relief be adopted in all similar cases.

12, That when it shall appear to a weekly committee that labour in husbandry cannot be obtained at the usual wages, on account of a general existing scarcity of work, the committee may order any reasonable sum, not exceeding one fourth of the real earnings of such labourers, employed by its consent, to be paid by overseers to the different  persons employing them, so that such earnings do not exceed six shillings a week for each man, and so in proportion for others. And when such earnings do necessarily fall short of six shillings a week, merely on account of the unseasonableness of the weather, (as in deep snow or hard frosts,) the deficiency may be made up to that sum, for a man who has a family to maintain.

13, That a sum not exceeding ten pounds In any one year, be laid out in purchasing spinning-wheels, cards, and such like implements of work, for the use of the industrious poor women and children; which, after being marked "house of Industry," maybe lent or given them, at the discretion of the weekly committee; and that work in spinning, knitting, &c. shall be supplied from the house, by an order from the said committee, to all  persons of the above description, who may not be able to procure any such work elsewhere.

20, That every single woman, becoming chargeable to this corporation the second time, on account of bastardy, shall be carried before two justices of the peace, to be dealt with according to law; and that all such women in the house, (except those, who are employed in the hard work of the house, and those who have been punished as aforesaid,) as well as all other  persons, who, by reason of their own criminality or misconduct, are there kept and maintained, shall be placed in separate apartments from the other poor, provided for that purpose; shall have their names entered in the black book; shall be allowed no solid meat on meat-days; and wear coarse yellow coats or gowns, or other disgraceful distinctions, at the discretion of the weekly committee.

40, That only one sort of flour be served into the house, and that, from the whole meal dressed through a 14s. cloth; and that only one meal of solid meat be served weekly; the other meat-dinner to be composed of meat cut into very small pieces, the bones broken very small, and boiled into broth, properly thickened with vegetables, &c.; and that only 150 lbs. of meat be allowed for that dinner; but that fat pork or bacon (to be bought in the flitch, without the hams) may be boiled, cut into very small slices, with pease, beans, or potatoes; for one dinner in the week, not exceeding 50 lbs.; and that the annexed bill of fare be particularly observed : subject, however, to such alteration.

he prefertt state of the institution to be very unnecessary. The directors and guardians are very regular in their attendance on committee days, &c.; and only one instance occurs in the annexed accounts of a fine having been paid by either a guardian or director, during the last 3 years.

59, That every quarterly committee of accounts shall examine into all the accounts of the preceding quarter, and shall prepare them for publication, and after they have thoroughly examined them, they shall fet their hands to the same : and the separate articles of the incidental expences, paid by the governor, shall be entered in the quarterly account-book, in the same manner as the bills, &c.; and no bills or salaries of officers shall be paid by the treasurer, till a printed order be produced, signed by the chairman of the committee of accounts. i5i, That any sum, not exceeding twelve shillings, may be allowed for the burial of any poor person dying out of the house, on application being made to the next weekly committee, or to a magistrate, on oath, that the deceased did not leave effects sufficient for defraying funeral expences : but that nothing shall be allowed when the  person is not buried at the sole expence of the corporation, and in the usual manner of such paupers; of which the officiating clergyman is desired to give a certificate.

70, That when it shall be found necessary to make use of any part, or the whole, of the fund of one thousand pounds, which has been raised from the savings of the average rates, and is vested on bond from the treasurer, to answer any extraordinary demands the great extent of the buildings, and the various articles of furniture may require, beyond what can be spared for the same, from the average rates in any one year : such fum, so used, shall be re-placed from the first savings that may be afterwards made.

The principal part of the building is 300 feet in length from east to west, by 37 wide in the clear; having windows on both sides, for the advantage of a thorough draught of airat the distance of 200 feet from the weft end, a wing from the main building ranges southward, 170 feet by 24; from the cud of which, are built work-shops for the manufacturers and mechanics; and these, with a walk on the west, form a square of 200 feet by 1 70.


On the east side of the wing is a court, 170 feet by 50, formed by offices on the north; such as dairy, wash-house,. brew-house, wood-house, store rooms, see. and a wall on the south. In the principal building Is a large store-room, Reward's room, dining hall-, 1 18 feet long by 27 wide, and a common sitting room, for the impotent and aged poor.

Under the east end there are cellars for beer, meat. see. Over this building are the governor's and matron's lodging rooms, the laundry, nurseries and sick wards.

In the wing on the ground floor are the school rooms, apothecary's shop, kitchen, scullery, bake-house, bread-room, governor's and matron's sitting room, and pantry; and over are the lying-in rooms, sick wards, and 20 separate rooms or apartments for married men and their wives, with two common sitting rooms adjoining, for the old and infirm, who are unable to go down stairs. In front of the principal building is a large gate-way; on the east side of which is a master weaver's room, and spinning room; 96 feet long by 18 wide, with store-rooms over it; at the west side of this gate-way are the shoe-maker's and tailor's shops, with a spinning room, 150 feet long by 18 wide, with weaving rooms and storerooms over;

The chapel is erected on the north side of the principal building: over it is a store-room. Four hundred yards distance is a pest-house, with a burying ground, walled in, close adjoiningi

To the north of the pest-house a building has been lately erected for the admission of  persons under inoculation : it consists of four rooms, each of about 15 feet by 14. On the south is a large garden, which supplies the house with vegetables. On the east, behind the offices, are placed -the hog-flies^ barn, stable, and other out-houses*.

The house can accommodate 700 people : the number of inmates;, how* ever, seldom exceeds 550. The following is a list of the present inmates: they amount to 495. ‘ (3d of April, 1796.)

86 men; from. 20, to 90. years of age, consisting of cripples,, bllnd^ idiots, lunatics, &c.

1 15 women; from 20 to 90 years of age; of whom the younger part; are blind, &c. or sent hither in cases of bastardy.

* Warner's Hampshire, iii. 73.

131 boys; from Infants to 13 years; among whom are many cripples, who are usually employed under the tailors, or shoe-makers, in the house; or in knitting, &c. according to their strength, and ability.

163 girls; from infants to 13 years; cripples, &c. some of whom can spin worsted, yarn, or flax.

The manufacture carried on in the house chiefly consists in making sacks for coal, flour, and biscuit; besides which, linfey, kerfeys, and other articles of that nature, are made, principally, for the use of the house. The quantity of each, annually manufactured during the last 3 years, and in the years ending at midsummer 1783, may be seen in the annexed accounts; which also specify the salaries paid to the governor, matron, and other officers.

The baptisms in the house, during the last 3 years were: 20 — 12 — 12 : and the burials, 68 — 32 — 61.

The number of regular out-pensioners is, at present, 44 : they receive, each, from is. to 3s. a week. The number of casual weekly poor, and the amount of casual weekly allowances, is very fluctuating; and depends much on the severity of the weather, and other circumstances. In January, and February, 1 793, the reliefs granted on saturdays, amounted, for several weeks, to 130. ^ 150. jT 170. and upwards. Laft winter the weekly reliefs, granted on saturdays, were from ^ 9. to jT 17.

The debt paid off amounts to £ 5250. : the debt now owing is ^ 12,200. The land belonging to the corporation, amounting to near 80 acres, is laid down in a grass farm. The produce is sold by a manager, and the receipts placed to the general account of the house.

The following statements of the receipts and expenditure for 4 years, are copied from printed papers, which are annually prepared and laid be* fore the corporation. They are, drawn up with great perspicuity and accuracy, and afford a clearer view of the various circumstances connected with this institution, than any general observations could convey. Perhaps but few improvements could be made in the mode of framing up this annual amount; but I would venture to suggest to the guardians, that the quantity of flax, hemp, wool, and other materials purchased, should be particularized, as well as the sums paid for them. The public would thereby be enabled to judge whether a house of industry bought their raw

materials dearer or cheaper than a common manufacturer. It Is like wise extremely desirable that the average number of men, women, and children, in the house, each month in the year, should be annexed to the account, as is done, (in a general manner,) at st. Peter's hospital in Bristol; and that the average number of men, women, and children, employed weekly, or monthly, in the manufactory, and of the goods actually manufactured in the year, should be printed : it is only from comparing such particulars, with the amount of expenditure, that a fair estimate can be formed of the work annually performed in a house of industry, and of the annual charge attending the maintenance of a Pauper, under these institutions.

in 1786 : [accounts follow]

That all poor  persons, whose families are too large to be maintained by their own labour, may offer one or more of their children to be received into the house, at the discretion of the weekly committee.

III.
That orders for admission into the house be made by a committee only; except in casualties, or sudden illness subsequent to the last committee, when an immediate admittance may be necessary: in such cases (and in such only), two directors, or acting guardians, may give an order for the same on any other day; as may the surgeon alone, in cases which happen in the night; with the further exception, that  persons sent by order of removal, or ^by a vagrant pass, be immediately received, without any other authority; but that the  persons thus admitted be reported to the next committee.


I


IV.
That poor  persons received into the house, for temporary relief only, shall not be deprived of their household goods, furniture or other property.

the pauper's settlement, and the inability of himself, and such of his relations as are compellable by law to maintain him : provided also, that nothing herein contained be construed to make void any pension already granted; but that the same be continued and renewed, unless such pensioners appear, on a similar examination, to be improper objects of relief from any parish within the island.

VI.
That a weekly committee may grant to the use of any poor labourer's wife, on the birth of a fourth, fifth, or sixth child, the respective sums of five shillings, seven shillings and sixpence, or ten shillings and sixpence, according, as he may then have living, four, five, or six, children, under fourteen years of age; — b\it, that five shillings thereof be applied, by the overseer, to the payment of the midwife.

' VII.
That one churchwarden, or overseer of the poor, of every parish, be obliged to apply to the weekly committee on every fitting, either in  person, or by a director, or acting guardian, and to report (after due enquiry made by himself, at the respective dwellings of the poor) the number and ages of the family, and other circumstances, including the place of settlement, as well as the illness of all  persons in his parish, who may afk for, and stand in need of, relief, under the penalty of any fum, not less than forty shillings and not exceeding five pounds, as dire(5led by the adt; but that relief may be granted to any pau- per, who may be in the same manner reported by the surgeon^ a director, or acting guardian.

VIII.
That in case of an application wherein the preceding regulation hath not been adhered to, the committee, if it fee proper, may entrust a director, or acting guardian, or the surgeon, with an order of relief, to be delivered, or not, to the pauper, according as the  person, thus en- trusted, may find the circumstances of the case; or the committee may order the surgeon, or parish-officer, to visit the said pauper, and to make a report, as before required, tb the next committee, which may then give relief from the time of the first application.

.IX.
That when any poor  person, by casualty, or sudden illness, subsequent to the last holden committee, may stand in need of immediate relief, before application can be made to the next meeting; a director, or acting guardian, on the knowledge of the fact and necessity of the case, may recommend such  person to the care of the surgeon, (which may likewise be done in all cases of sickness among the poor, though no pecuniary relief be applied for) and may, where necessary, order, in writing, a reasonable fum, not exceeding the usual earnings of the sick  person, after ihc rate of one shilling a day for a man, and
fo


C 7 ]
fo for others in proportion, as a temporary fup- port till the next weekly committee; to which the overseer of the respective parish must in person report the circumstances, and receive directions for the farther relief of the pauper; and (to be entitled to the allowance of the sum ordered on the fettling of his accounts) must, at the same time, return the said order for confirmation, by being signed by the chairman.
X.
That all casual poor, relieved by the order of a director, or acting guardian, shall, on the re- port of the surgeon at the next weekly commit- tee, be ordered into the house, or relieved out of it, as shall appear expedient for the health of the patient.

XL
That the weekly committee, on application of an overseer, may grant monthly relief out of the house to the families of men impressed into the sea-service, during their continuance as impressed men, not exceeding the sum of one shilling and sixpence a week, for two children under the age of ten years; the sum of two shillings a week, for three such children; and the sum of three shillings a week, for four such; to be paid weekly by the respective overseers, who are required to stop payment on the death or discharge of any such man, and report the state of the family to the next weekly committee; and that this proportion of relief be adopted in all similar cases.


r 8 1 ^
XII.
That when it shall appear to a weekly committee that labour in husbandry cannot be obtained at the usual wages, on account of a general existing scarcity of work, the committee may order any reasonable fum, not exceeding one fourth of the real earnings of such labourers, employed by its con fen t, to be paid by overseers to the different  persons employing them, so that such earnings do not exceed six shillings a week for each man, and so in proportion for others. And when such earnings do necessarily fall short of six shillings a week, merely on account of the unseasonableness of the weather (as in deep snow or hard frosts), the deficiency may be made up to that sum, for a man who has a family to maintain;
