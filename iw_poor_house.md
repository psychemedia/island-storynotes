TO DO

IsLE OF WIGHT.

THE Poor belonging to the various parllhes in the Ifle of Wight arc chiefly relreved at a House of Industry fituated near the town of Newport. It was ercdled under the authority of an Adi of Parliament paffed in .1 771 whereby 80 acres of the foreft of Parkhurfl; were veiled in the gentlemen of the ifland for the 'term of 999 years, under the title of the Corporation or Guardians of the Poor of the Ifle of Wight; and, in order that each parish might contribute it's fair proportion, an account was taken of the amount of their resective Poor's Rates for the preceding 7 years, and, according to the average, the ratio of their future payments was determined on; so that those parllhes, whofe parochial charges were the heaviest at the time of the valuation, are now burthened with the greatsest quota towards the consolidated fund. One pays 2s. in the pound on the rack rent; another, ijd,; and a third, 3s. 3d. in the pound upon twothirds of the rent. The Corporation was authorized to borrow 12,000. for the purpose of erecting the House of Industry; but this sum being found inadequate to complete the design, a second application was made to Parliament, and by an Ad palTed in 1 776, the Corporation was empowered to borrow an additional sum not exceeding jTs 000.; and as the provifions of the former Ad had been found by experience to be extremely defedive, the whole was repealed, and new powers and regulations provided \

The members of the Corporation are fiich inhabitants of the ifland as are feifed in fee, or for life, or of leafehold upon lives, in their own or their wives* right, of lands or property rated to the Poor's Rate at jfyo. a year; heirs apparent to property rated at 00. a year; all redors and vicars of the ifland; and all occupiers of lands or property rated at 100. whether in one or more pariflies within the ifland. On the last Thurfday in June, in every year, 24 directors, (of whom 12 are to be such as were not directors in the preceding year,) are eleded by the Corporation from their own body; proper  persons for acting guardians are iikewife nominated in each parish by the Inhabitants alTelTed to the Poor's Rate, and lifts tranfmitted to the directors, from which reprefentatives for each

pariflij (according to the proportion they pay towards the Poor's Rate,} are chosen by ballot, to make up the number of 36 acting guardians, who. continue in office one year. A clerk and other neceffiu y officers are likewife appointed. The directors and guardians are divided into quarterly,, monthly, and w'eekly committees, the last of which confid of 2 directors and 5 acting ‘guardians. They meet at the house every saturday, to fettle the governor and ftew^ards' accounts of the preceding w'eek, to give diredions for the enfuing week, to hear complaints, to grant occafional relief to  persons out of the house, and to attend to such cafes as require immediate invelligation. The following are the moft material of the bye.laws enaded by the Corporation for the regulation and government of the House of Induftry ;

1, That all poor  persons, single or married, without families, who are unable to maintain themfelves, be taken into the house, and not fupported out of it by any fettled allowance or penfion..

2, That all poor  persons, whofe families are too large to be maintained by their owm labour, may offer one or more of their, children, to he received into the house, at the dlfcretion of the weekly committee,.

4, That poor  persons received into the house, for temporary relief only, shall' not be deprived of their houflrold goods, furniture or other property. But such wearing apparel, and other goods, as any pauper may bring into the house, shall be deemed and taken to be the property of the guardians of the poor, during the. time such  person Ihalh be maintained in the house.

6, That a: weekly committee may grant to the. use of any poor labourer's w'ife, on the birth of a fourth, fifth, or sixth child, the refpedive sums of five shillings, seven shillings and sixpence, or ten shillings and sixpence, according as he may then have living, four, five, or fix children, under fourteen years of age; but, that five Ihillings thereof be applied, by the overseer, to the payment of- the midwife,

y, That one churchwarden, or overseer of the poor, of every parish, he obliged to apply to the weekly committee on every fitting, either in  person, or by a director, or acting guardian, and to report, (after due enquiry made by himself, at the respective dwellings of the poor,) the number and ages of the family, and other ciicumstances, including

the place of settlement, as well as the Illnefs of all  persons in his parish, who may afk for, or Hand in need of, relief, under the penalty of any fum, not lefs than forty shillings, and not exceeding five pounds, as diredled by the A6t; but that relief may be granted to any pauper, who may be in the same manner reported by the surgeon, a diredor, or acting guardian.

8, That in cafe of an application wherein the preceding regulation hath not been adhered to, the committee, if it fee proper, may entrust a eliredor, or acting guardian, or the surgeon, with an order of relief, to be delivered, or not, to the pauper, according as the  person, thus entrufted, may find the circumstances of the case; or the committee may order the surgeon, or parish-officer, to visit the said pauper, and to make a report, as before required, to the next committee, which may then give relief from the time of the first application.

1 1, That the weekly committee, on application of an overseer, may grant monthly relief out of the house to the families of men impressed Into the sea-service, during their continuance as imprefled men, not exceeding the sum of one shilllng and sixpence a week, for two children under the age of ten years; the sum of two shillings a week, for three such children; and the sum of three shillings a week, for four such; to be paid weekly by the refpedive overseers, who are required to (lop payment on the death or discharge of any such man, and report the state of the family to the next weekly committee; and that this proportion of relief be adopted In all fimilar cases.

12, That when it shall appear to a weekly committee that labour In husbandry cannot be obtained at the usual wages, on account of a general existing scarcity of work, the committee may order any reasonable fum, not exceeding one fourth of the real earnings of such labourers, employed by its confent, to be paid by overseers to the dllferent  persons employing them, so that such earnings do not exceed six shillings a week for each man, and so in proportion for others. And when such earnings do neceffarily fall short of six shillings a week, merely on account of the unseasonablenefs of the weather, (as in deep snow or hard frosts,) the deficiency may be made up to that fum, for a man who has a family to maintain.

13, That a sum not exceeding ten pounds In any one year, be laid out In purchafing fpinning-wheels, cards, and such like implements of work,

the

he prefertt state of the institution to be very unnecessary. The direcctors and guardians are very regular in their attendance on committee days, &c.; and only one instance occurs in the annexed accounts of a fine having been paid by either a guardian or diredor, during the last 3 years.

59, That every quarterly committee of accounts shall examine into all the accounts of the preceding quarter, and Hiall prepare them for publication, and after they have thoroughly examined them, they shall fet their hands to the same : and the separate articles of the incidental expences, paid by the governor, shall be entered in the quarterly account-book, in the same manner as the bills, &c.; and no bills or falaries of olEcers shall be paid by the treafurer, till a printed order be produced, figned by the chairman of the committee of accounts. i5i, That any sum, not exceeding twelve shillings, may be allowed for the burial of any poor person dying out of the house, on application being made to the next weekly committee, or to a magistrate, on oath, that the deceafed did not leave effects sufficient for defraying funeral expences : but that nothing shall be allowed when the  person is not buried at the foie expencc of the corporation, and in the usual manner of such paupers; of which the officiating clergyman is defired to give a certificate.

70, That when it ffiall be found neceffiary to make use of any part, or the whole, of the fund of one thousand pounds, which has been raised from the savings of the average rates, and is vefted on bond from the treafurer, to anfwer any extraordinary demands the great extent of the buildings, and the various articles of furniture may require, beyond what can be spared for the same, from the average rates in any one year : such fum, so used, ffiall be re-placed from the first savings that may be afterwards made.

The principal part of the building is 300 feet in length from east to west, by 37 wide in the clear; having windows on both fides, for the advantage of a thorough draught of air : at the diftance of 200 feet from the weft end, a wing from the main building ranges fouthward, 170 feet by 24; from the cud of which, are built work-ffiops for the manufadurers and mechanics; and thefe, with a walk on the weft, form a fquare of 200 feet by 1 70.


On the east side of the wing is a court, 170 feet by 50, formed by offices on the north; such as dairy, walh-house,. brew-house, wood-house, store rooms, see. and a wall on the fouth. In the principal building Is a large store-room, Reward's room, dining hall-, 1 18 feet long by 27 wide, and a common fitting room, for the impotent and aged poor.

Under the eafl: end there are cellars for beer, meat. see. Over this building are the governor's and matron's lodging rooms, the laundry, nurseries and sick wards*

In the wing on the ground floor are die fchool rooms, apothecary's shop, kitchen, scullery, bake-house, bread-room, governor's and matron's fitting room, and pantry; and over are the lying-in rooms, fick wards, and 20 separate rooms or apartments for married men and their wives, with two common fitting rooms adjoining, for the old and infirm, who are unable to go dov/n flairs. In front of the principal building is a large gate-way; on the east side of which is a master weaver's room, and fpinning room; 96 feet long by 18 wide, with store-rooms over it; at the weft side of this gate- way are the shoe-maker's and tailor's shops, with a spinning room, 150 feet long by 18 wide, with weaving rooms and storerooms over;

The chapelfis ereded on the north side of the principal building: over it is a store-room. Four hundred yards diftance is a peft-house, with a burying ground, walled in, clofe adjoiningi

To the north of the peft-house a building has been lately eredled for the admiflion of  persons under inoculation : it confifts of four roomsj each of about 15 feet by 14. On the fouth is a large garden, which fupplies the house with vegetables. On the east, behind the offices, are placed -the hog-flies^ barn, ftable, and other out-houses*.

The house can.accommodate 700 people : the number of inmates;, how* ever, feldom exceeds 550. The following is a lift of the prefent inmates: they amount to 495. ‘ (3d of April, 1796.)

86 men; from. 20, to 90. years of age, confifting of cripples,, bllnd^ idiots, lunatics, &c.

1 15 women; from 20 to 90 years of age; of whom the. younger part; are blind, &c. or fent hither in cafes of baftardy.

* Warner's Hamplhire, iii. 73.

131 boys; from Infants to 13 years; among whom are many cripples, who are usually employed under the tailors, or fhoc-makers, in the house; or in knitting, &c. according to their ftrength, and ability.

163 girls; from infants to 13 years; cripples, &c. some of whom can spin wor??ed, yarn, or flax.

The manufacture carried on in the house chiefly consists in making sacks for coal, flour, and biscuit; besides which, linfey, kerfeys, and other articles of that nature, are made, principally, for the use of the house. The quantity of each, annually manufaistured during the last 3 years, and in the years ending at midfummer 1783, may be feen in the annexed accounts; which also fpecify the falaries paid to the governor, matron, and other officers.

The baptifms in the house, during the last 3 years were: 20 — 12 — 12 : and the burials, 68 — 32 — 61.

The number of regular out-pensioners is, at prefent, 44 : they receive, each, from is. to 3s. a week. The number of casual weekly poor, and the amount of casual weekly allowances, is very fluduating; and depends much on the feverity of the weather, and other circumstances. In January, and February, 1 793, the reliefs granted on saturdays, amounted, for several weeks, to 130. ^ 150. jT 170. and upwards. Laft winter the weekly reliefs, granted on saturdays, w^ere from ^ 9. to jT 17.

The debt paid off amounts to £ 5250. : the debt now owing is ^ 12,200. The land belonging to the corporation, amounting to near 80 acres, is laid down in a grafs farm. The produce is fold by a manager, and the receipts placed to the general account of the house.

The following ftatements of the receipts and expenditure for 4 years, are copied from printed papers, which are annually prepared and laid be* fore the corporation. They are, drawn up with great perspicuity and accuracy, and afford a clearer view of the various circumstances connected with this institution, than any general observations could convey. Perhaps but few improvements could be made in the mode of framing up this annual amount; but I would venture to suggest to the guardians, that the quantity of flax, hemp, wool, and other materials purchased, should be particularized, as well as the sums paid for them. The public would thereby be enabled to judge whether a house of induftry bought their raw

materials dearer or cheaper than a common manufacturer. It Is like wife extremely desirable that the average number of men, women, and children, in the house, each month in the year, fhould be annexed to the account, as is done, (in a general manner,) at st. Peter's hospital in Bristol; and that the average number of men, women, and children, employed weekly, or monthly, in the manufactory, and cf the goods actually manufactured in the year, fhould be printed : it is only from comparing such particulars, with the amount of expenditure, that a fair eftimatc can be formed of the work annually performed in a house of induftry, and of the annual charge attending the maintenance of a Pauper, under thefe inflitutions.

The following table is extrated from the Returns made to Parliament

in 1786 : [accounts follow]
