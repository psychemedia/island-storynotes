A FAVOURITE excursion of those who run down to the seaside to consult ** one* of the best of physicians " — he whom Thackeray has well described as **kind, cheerful, merry Doctor Brighton " — is to the Devil's Dyke. To that picturesque spot with an evil name there come pilgrims by coach, by train, and on foot to gaze upon the wide expanding landscape of the Weald, to have their fortunes told by the gipsy ** queens" who ply their trade in flagrant defiance of the statute book, or to disport themselves in the somewhat cockney paradise that has arisen on this lovely part of the South Downs. The Dyke itself is the work of Mother Nature in one of her sportive moods, when she seems to imitate or to anticipate the labours of man. Here she has carved out a deep trench that looks as though it were the work of the Anakim. It has its legendary interest also, for the Sussex peasantry hold, or held, that it came into existence by the exertions of the "Poor Man," as the Father of Evil is here euphemistically called. Looking over the fertile Weald, his Satanic Majesty was grievously offended by the sight of the many churches dotted over the smiling plain, and he decided to cut a passage through the Downs so that the waters of the sea might rush through the opening and drown the whole of the valley. An old woman whose cottage was in the vicinity, hearing the noise made by the labouring devil in his work of excavation, came to her window, and holding her candle behind a sieve, looked out. The "Poor Man" caught sight of the glimmering light, and hastily concluded that the sun was rising. The mediaeval devil could only do his malicious deeds in the dark, and so he slunk away, leaving the Dyke incomplete, as we now see it. - Lest anyone should doubt this story, the marks of the "Poor Man's" footprints are still pointed out on the turf. ...

LEGEND or THE Devil’s Dyke.—Circulating in the neighbourhood of the Devil’s Dyke, near Brighton, is a broadside which professes to give the origin of that entrenchment according to local tradition. According to this story, which is artificial and much spun out, the devil appeared one night among the company at the "Jolly Shepherd," near Poynings, and was seen about three next morning, when the hostess of that inn looked out of her window, mounted on stilts and digging hard where now is the Dyke. The landlady had caught up a sieve to shade the candle she held in her hand, and when the demon looked up, and "saw the candle behind the sieve, surmounted by the old woman's nightcap," he sang out, "The rising sun!" and fled in dismay. The broadside ends with the following, respecting which I should be obliged by any information:—"But if you go and read the ancient Saxon inscription on the baptismal font found among the ruins of Bayham Abbey, you will find that 'that' (sic) is not the account that the Monks give you there."

Tue Deviw’s Dyke (5 §. x. 307.)—The legend, as I know it, is as follows. One day as St. Cuthman was walking over the South Downs, and thinking to himself how completely he had rescued the whole country from paganism, he was accosted by his sable majesty in person. "Ah, ha!" said the prince of darkness, "so you think by these churches and convents to put me and mine to your ban, do you? Poor fool, why this very night will I swamp the whole land with the sea." Forewarned is forearmed, thought St. Cuthman, and hies him to sister Cecilia, superior of a convent which then stood on the spot of the present Dyke House. "Sister," said the saint, "I love you well. This night, for the grace of God, keep lights burning at the convent windows from midnight to daybreak, and let masses be ordered by the holy sisterhood." At sundown came the devil with pickaxe and spade, mattock and shovel, and set to work in right good earnest to dig a dyke which should let the waters of the sea into the downs. "Fire and brimstone!" he exclaimed, a sound of voices rose and fell in sacred song, "fire and brimstone! what's the matter with me?" Shoulders, feet, wrists, — all seemed paralyzed. Down went mattock an spade, pickaxe and shovel; the lights at the convent windows burst forth, and the cock, the blaze for daybreak, began to crow most Off flew the devil, and never again returned to complete his work. The small digging he effected still remains in testimony of the truth of the legend of the "Devil’s Dyke".

Sussex abounds in evidences of the Devil’s whimsical handiwork, although in ordinary conversation Sussex rustics are careful not to speak his name. They say "he." Mr. Parish, in his* Dictionary of the Sussex Dialect*, gives an example of the avoidance of the dread name: "'In the Down there's a golden calf buried; people know very well where it is —I could show you the place any day.' 'Then why don't they dig it up?' 'Oh, it's not allowed: *he* wouldn't let them.' 'Has any one ever tried?' 'Oh yes, but it's never there when you look;*he*Ze moves it away.'" His punchbowl may be seen here, his footprints there; but the greatest of his enterprises was certainly the Dyke. His purpose was to submerge or silence the irritating churches of the Weald, by digging a ditch that should let in the sea. He began one night from the North side, at Saddlescombe, and was working very well until he caught sight of the beams of a candle which an old woman had placed in her window. Being a Devil of Sussex rather than of Miltonic invention, he was not clever, and taking the candle light for the break of dawn, he fled and never resumed the labour. That is the very infirm legend that is told and sold at the Dyke.

Along the whole range of the South Downs the Wheatear has its haunts, especially about the vicinity of the Devil's Dyke, which is a place of general rendezvous for sportsmen and pleasure-seekers. It was formerly known as the Poor Man's Wall, and even now, in its deep trenches, exhibits the form and extent of a Roman encampment.

About five-and-forty years ago, in consequence of the large extent of company that frequented the spot in summer-time, to view the vast expanse of country which the site commands, Mr. Sharp, a confectioner, then carrying on his business in North Street, on the

spot now occupied by the premises of Mr. Abrahams, outfitter, conceived the idea of establishing a place for refreshment near the summit of the hill, and for that purpose hii'ed a piece of ground north of the high vallum which runs westward from the top of the Dyke to the brow of the hill. Thither he conveyed a wooden house that had been used as a bacon shop by a man named Smith. It formerly stood upon wooden wheels opposite the shop of Mr, Hyam Lewis, silversmith, in Ship Street Lane, now the upper end of Ship Street ; but it at present forms a dwelling place, under the hill, by the tm-npike road to Fulking, at the base of the Devil's Punch Bowl, close by the village of Pojnings.

The person who first superintended the Dyke establishment was Mr. Russell, who was succeeded by Mr. Thomas Sturt. His successor was Mr. Thomas King, familiarly then and now known as " Tommy King," whose refreshing beverages and exhilirating fiddling gave him a far and near notoriety. The premises were only occupied and opened during the Summer season, from May to October j and although stabling and other accommodation were constructed, in a few years the public requirements induced the erection of the present building, the Dyke House, by Mr. Hardwick, and it has successively passed fi"om King to Mr. Edwards, of Horsham, the tenant who obtained the spirit license ; Mr. Ade, of Huntingdon ; Mr. "William Cooper, of Brighton ; Mr. Peter Barkshire, now of Patcham ; to its present occupier, Mr. "William Thacker, who has been landlord of the , house, and tenant of the farm attached twenty-seven years, during which period he has received the royal patronage of William IV. and Her present Majesty and the late Prince Consort. The house has also been the resort of many 'illustrious foreign visitors, amongst whom may be named Piince Metternich and Count Nesselrode.

The most notorious character who took up his abode here, was Azimidlah Khan, the great promoter of the Mutiny in India. He was a resident in Brighton during the Spring and Summer of 1 846 ; but towards the latter end of the Autumn of that year, by the alleged advice of his physician, he, for three weeks, had apartments at the Dyke House ; and during that time he was constantly receiving and sending off Indian overland messengers with enormous

despatches, without doubt having reference to that shocking revojt which will for ever remain an odious blot upon the history of our East Indian dominions. Azimullah was the Prime Minister of the arch fiend, jSTana Sahib ; and though it might be saying too much in declaring that the plan of the insurrection was decided upon at the Dyke House, there is little doubt that the first copy of the proclamation was prepared there. Lieutenant Delafosse, one of the few survivors of the Cawnpore massacre, on his return to England visited the Dyke, and there assured Mr Thacker that he saw Azimullah on the river bank at Cawnpore, in the company of Nana Sahib, waving his sword when the guns were discharging their murderous bjdls into the boats which contained the defenceless victims.

The steep sides of the Dyke have been the scenes of numerous accidents, from persons having the temerity to run down them. Some daring feats of riding and driving have also been exhibited here. The most memorable and daring act was that of Tom Poole, who, for the wager of a champagne dinner for twelve, drove a tandem down the most abrupt part. It was most cleverly accomplished, without the least accident ; but that he might not be disappointed in participating in the wagered repast, — in the event of the loss of Life or limb in the performance of the exploit, — ho insisted upon having the dinner before he undertook his task. Many other dare-devil tricks have been attempted here ; and perhaps the most remarkable is that related in what is familiarly known as the

LEGEND OF THE DEVIL'S DYKE.

"Once upon a time, at the period of yore, in the days of mistletoe and harvest-homing, when our country merited the title of 'merrie England,' there was to be found on the edge of the South Downs, opposite the pleasant little village of Poynings, in Sussex, a humble hostel, or village Inn, yclept 'The Jolly Shepherd,' kept by one Dame Margery, who, in her younger days, had followed the camp, but had long since retired upon her reputation as a trooper's widow. The accommodations of the 'Jolly Shepherd' would be held in slight repute in modern days, but in the time of which we are speaking they were reckoned all-sufficient, although consisting chiefly of a warm seat by a cheerful fire, fresh eggs and bacon, and good honest home-brewed ale; and accordingly some half-dozen rustic customers were seated round the widow's hearth, to escape the cutting blast of the Downs without, and commemorate the eve of Holy Saint John, within. Suddenly the song and the tale of the party were interrupted by a most mysterious knocking at the door, and a shrill, querulous voice demanding instant admittance. The active old hostess hastened to obey, but made a kind of a jump, step, and hop backward, on beholding the unusual appearance of the new arrival, exclaiming, 'Lord preserve us! what is it?' 'A gentleman from below,' replied a little, decrepid, wizened old man,

Whose coat was red, whose breeches were blue,  
With a little hole where a tail came through.

He glided into the room and crept along by the wall, with the most infernal ceremony and politeness, to the inner recess of the chimney corner, without having once shown his back to his hostess or any of the good company there assembled, and quickly finding himself comfortably seated, the queer little old gentleman produced a blackened 'Dudeen' and a velvet tobacco pouch, but somehow or other the clouds of smoke he emitted were so pervaded with the smell of brimstone and bitumen, that the rest of the guests did nothing but sneeze and knock their heads together in a regular hob-and-nob fashion. To stop this nuisance, the worthy hostess placed before her mysterious guest a frizzing hot dish of eggs and bacon, but upon tasting the same, he expressed his dissatisfaction, declaring it was as cold as charity, and demanding 'more pepper.' He, upon receiving it, emptied the contents of the pepper-box over the dish, and having thus formed a regular *pate au diable*, he swallowed it down with considerable apparent relish. With the ale it was pretty much the same; the hostess first mulled it, but her refractory guest declared it was as cold as ice; then she boiled it with a vast quantity of ginger, but with little better success, and it could only be brought to suit his fiery palate by being stirred up, when boiling, with a red hot poker. These strange proceedings of the mysterious visitor mightily astonished the rest of the guests, their faces becoming much elongated; and after staring at each other in stupified bewildennent, they stealthily took to their homes, exclaiming, 'Did you ever see the Devil?' The whole of the company had departed long ere the cause of their uneasiness left his chimney corner and glided to his sleeping apartment, which he managed to do in the same mysterious manner as he had entered the house, never once removing his back from the wall. About three o'clock in the morning, our worthy hostess of 'The Jolly Shepherd' was awakened from her balmy slumbers, by a strange thumping, bumping kind of noise just under her window, seeming to resemble the hubbub made by a shoal of whales or other such lumbering monsters, who had quitted the ocean deep, and taken to wallowing and gambolling along the Downs by way of pastime. The trooper's widow possessed a bold heart, and, added thereto, she had a woman's curiosity, which induced her to creep out of bed, and cautiously to take a peep at what was going on. She was amazed? She did not behold half a dozen Leviathans having a game at leap-frog, nor the like number of griffins playing at snap-dragon. No, no, nothing of that sort; but the queer little old gentleman aforesaid, mounted on a pair of lofty stilts, with a huge spade in his hand, was digging away at the edge of the ancient Roman encampment, like the very 'old-un,' shovelling out the chalk and flint stones by waggon loads, and his tail whisking about like a serpent in fits. The bold hostess did not hail him to stop his digging. Not she, good honest soul, as she was desirous of seeing a little clearer what he was about, before giving any alarm; so she quickly struck a light, and lest the candle should alarm her ancient guest, she caught up something to put before it, and this something fortunately happened to be a sieve. Suddenly the old gentleman ceased working, looked up at the window, and when he saw the candle behind the seive, surmounted by the old woman's night cap, he exclaimed 'Oh! Beelzebub, the rising sun,' and folding his stilts across to form a spindle, ho ducked his head forward and rolling himself into a ball like a hedgehog, he went bounding along the Downs with fearful rapidity. The Right Rev. Rector of Poynings had been to a jolly christening, had made a wet night of it, and was endeavouring to navigate his road homewards, when he saw a sort of galvanized harlequin whirling and tumbling along straight towards him. The Rev. Rector stopped short; when, just on passing, a sharp pointed sting was protruded from the rolling mass; and having slightly touched his Reverence's great toe, the whole ball exhaled, evaporated and vanished — *exit in fumo*. The parish duties of Poynings were performed by the Curate for the next three months; the doctor said his Reverence was laid up with the gout, but the Rector himself maintained it was the Devil. The question has ever since been, what could induce this queer old gentleman to set to work and dig away in such an outlandish fashion? Some old gossips say that his evil intention was to let in the salt sea, and flood all this most beautiful valley of pleasant Sussex. Be that as it may, one fact is worth noting, that the hostelry of 'The Jolly Shepherd,' from that period ceased its existence, and never, in the village of Poynings, since that night, when his Satanic Majesty was foiled, has a license been held by any person *again* to 'sell spirits.'"

The largest attendance of visitors to the Dyke, is during the months of August and September, when, frequently, as many as a hundred carriages a-day arrive with parties, either to view the magnificent expanse of scenery which the spot commands, or on pic-nic excursions, as the establishment has accommodation for many sets of visitors at the same time. The predilection which the English have for displaying their wit in snatches of their poetic genius, has, on the walls of the rooms, the looking-glasses, and the panes of glass in the windows, extensive scope, and signatures innumerable crowd every available spot.

O! foul attempt to give a deathless lot  
To names ignoble, born to be forgot.  
In vain recorded.

The house being erected is so exposed and elevated a situation, one of the highest of the South-Down range, damage by gales and storms is very frequent. From the loneliness of its position, too, burglars have made various attempts to obtain spoil, but the reception they have always met with has rendered their expeditions a trouble rather than a profit. The spot was especially chosen by the late Duke of St. Albans for his hawking excursions, as it afforded an extensive range of sight to the numerous company of nobility and gentry, who attended upon such occasions to witness that old English pastime. The Brighton Harriers, at least once a week during the season, throw off here, and other packs make it their place of meeting.

The Devil's Dyke is five miles and a half from Brighton, in a north-west direction. It is a very extensive oval intrenchment, about a mile in circumference, accessible only by a narrow projection to the south. It is fortified with a broad ditch, the earth thrown inwards, and forming a very high rampart, called the Poor-man's-wall. Its original meaning therefore seems to have been retained, as a place of security for the distressed Britons; but it is more commonly known, at the present day, as The Devil's Dyke.

From the summit of this mount, which you reach by a gradual ascent from the south, you have a romantic view of the whole weald of Sussex, and the adjoining parts of Hampshire, Surrey, and Kent. A prospect more picturesque and beautiful is scarcely to be imagined. A small but neat inn has been erected here, which affords refreshments to all applicants.

THE DEVIL'S DYKE, a Sussex legend.

Five hundred years ago or more, Or if you please, in days of yore ; That wicked wight y'clept *Old Nick* , Renown' d for many a wanton trick, With envy from the Downs beheld The studded churches of the Weald ; (Here Poynings cruciform, and there Hurst, Albourne, Bolney, Newtimber.

Cuckfield, and more, with towering crest, Quae nunc prescribere longum est.) Oft heard the undulating chime Proclaim around 'twas service time. •( Can I, with common patience, see These churches, and not one for me ? Shall I be cheated of my due By such a sanctimonious crew ? " He muttered twenty things beside ; And swore that night the foaming tide, Led through a vast and wondrous trench Should give these pious souls a drench !

Adown the West the steeds of Day Hasted merrily away, And Night in solemn pomp came on, Her lamp the stars — a cloud her throne : The lightsome Moon she was not there, But deck'd the other hemisphere.

Now with a fit capacious spade, So large it was on purpose made, Old Nick began, with much ado, To cut the lofty Downs in two : At every dig he shovel I'd out A thousand waggon load, no doubt ! 01 had he labour'd till the morrow, His envious work had wrought much sorrow ; The Weald, with verdant beauty graced, O'erwhelmed — a sad and watery waste.

But so it chanced, a good old dame, Whose deed has long outliv'd her name, Waked by the cramp at midnight hour, Or just escaped the night-mare's power, Rose from her humble bed, when lo ! She heard Nick's terrible ado ! And by the star-light faintly spied This wicked wight, and dyke so wide 1 She knew him by his mighty size, His tail, his horns, and saucer eyes ; And while with wonderment amaz'd, At workman and at work she gaz'd, Swift cross her mind a thought there flew, That she, by stratagem, might do A deed, which luckily should save Her country from a watery grave ; By his own weapons fairly beating The father of all lies and cheating !

Forth from her casement in a minute, A sieve of wire with candle in it,

She held to view — and simple Nick, Who ne'er suspected such a trick, (All rogues are fools,) when first his sight A full orb'd luminary bright Beheld, decamp'd — his work undone — Scared at the sight of a new sun; And muttered curses that the dayShould drive him from the job away ! Night after night this knowing dame Watch'd — but again Nick never came ! Who now dare call the action evil To hold a candle to the Devil.

W. Hamper.
