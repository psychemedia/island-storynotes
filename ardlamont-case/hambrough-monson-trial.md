INTRODUCTION.

The trial of Alfred John Monson on the double charge of attempting to murder and of murdering Windsor Dudley Cecil Hambrough at Ardlamont, Argyllshire, may be placed in the list of Scottish trials as the most important which has taken place since that of Madeleine Smith, nearly fifty years ago ; and, as in the case of that trial, the most abiding interest to students of criminology lies in the fact that the verdict was that anomalous and peculiarly Scottish one of " not proven," and that the mystery which was seen to enfold the case from the first was not dispelled by any definite pronouncement by the jury. Not only was the charge against the prisoner the most serious which any man has to face at the hands of his fellow-men, but also the circumstances of the alleged crime, the place where it occurred, and the social position of the accused and of his alleged victim were of such a kind as at once to arrest attention and to make people look with interested eyes to the High Court of Justiciary in Edinburgh, where, on 12th December, 1893, the prosecution and the defence began their efforts, extending over ten long days, to get at the heart of the mystery. But as day by day the evidence unfolded itself, and as the rival theories upon which the Crown and the defence were staking their respective cases came to be apparent, the interest became deepened until, throughout the length and breadth of the country, men were busy with the solution of the problems of the case which soon came to be known, and has continued to be known, as " The Ardlamont Mystery."

Round the question of how the boy Cecil Hambrough came by death was woven, as the trial proceeded, a web of evidence the like of which, in complexity and in diversity, has been surpassed in no criminal trial in Scotland. In the attempt by the Crown to show to the satisfaction of the jury that the accused man was guilty as libelled, and in the attempt to refute this contention, the counsel on either side brought forward the evidence of diverse and dissimilar witnesses, from the unlettered testimony of ploughmen, grooms, domestic servants, and game-keepers, to the expert evidence of surveyors, gunmakers, and medical men of great experience and high standing. The motive which the Crown sought to prove in order to strengthen their contention was the accused man's belief that by the death of Cecil Hambrough he would be financially a gainer to a considerable extent, and for the proving and disproving of this element of the case a tangle of financial enterprises in which the prisoner had been engaged for several years had to be unravelled by the evidence of actuaries, insurance officials, and financial men of many and varied hues. The case was further complicated by the evidence relating to the identity and disappearance of Scott, the alleged accomplice of the prisoner, that enigmatic figure which flitted across the stage at the most critical moment of the drama, coming from where no man knows and disappearing beyond the ken of men.

Although undoubtedly, of all the evidence which was led during the trial, that which dealt most intimately with the young man's death is, from a sensational point of view, of most clamant interest, yet there are many eddies and backwashes of the stream of evidence which are well worthy the attention of those who have the taste for studying the minutiae of a great trial ; and, looking at the case from a purely technical point of view, it is important on account of the legal points which came up for decision and which form an appendix to this report.

The uncontroversial facts of the case revealed during the progress of the trial are briefly these. In 1890 Mr. Monson was introduced to Major Hambrough, the father of Cecil Hambrough, by Mr. Tottenham, a London financier, and at Major Hambrough's request Mr. Monson undertook the custody and tuition of the boy Cecil, then seventeen years of age, till he should pass into the army, and for his services Mr. Monson was to be paid at the rate of £300 a year. At this time Major Hambrough was in a state of financial difficulty, and had mortgaged his life interest in certain family estates to an insurance company which had foreclosed, that is, had made itself owner of the interests mortgaged. Soon after taking up his duties as tutor to the boy Mr. Monson entered into negotiations with Major Hambrough with a view to relieving the Major's embarrassment, and these negotiations went on for some time. In 1892, however, for some reason a rupture occurred in the relations between Mr. Monson and the Major, who, from this time onward, used all his influence to induce his son to leave his tutor's house. In this he was unsuccessful, and Cecil continued to stay with Mr. Monson, most of his time being spent at a place in Yorkshire, where Monson was then residing.

In August, 1892, Mr. Monson was adjudicated bankrupt. In January, 1893, negotiations were entered into by him and Cecil with a view of raising money on the boy's expectancy in the Hambrough estates, but in February these broke down. Shortly after this Mr. Monson began to communicate with a firm of shooting agents in London in order to obtain the lease of a shooting in Scotland for the season, and in May a lease of Ardlamont House and shootings, in Argyllshire, was entered into in the names of Cecil Hambrough and Mr. Jerninghani, a gentleman whom Mr. Monson represented as being Cecil's guardian and good for the rent. The rent was £450 for the season, half to be paid by 1st August, under the condition that if it were not paid within a certain number of days thereafter the lease was to be void. Mr. Monson with his family went north to Ardlamont, and Cecil Hambrough joined them after finishing his training with the Yorks Militia, in which he held the rank of lieutenant. At this period and for some time before Mr. Monson and Cecil were being financed by Mr. Tottenham. In July Mr. Monson commenced to negotiate with Messrs. J. & F. Anderson, W.S., Edinburgh, agents for the proprietor of Ardlamont, for the purchase of the estate by Cecil Hambrough, but the price offered by Monson on behalf of Cecil was so inadequate that the agents would not consider it and the negotiations came to nothing. At the same time attempts were being made to effect an insurance over the life of Cecil Hambrough, and, after proposals to several insurance companies had been refused, owing to difficulties as to the insurable interest of those proposing the insurance, a proposal by Cecil Hambrough for insurance on his own life for £20,000, divided into two policies of £10,000 each, was accepted by the Mutual Life Assurance Company of New York, and the first premium, amounting to £194, was paid by Monson out of a cheque sent for another purpose by Tottenham. The policies were dated 4th August, and on 7th August Cecil Hambrough wrote to the manager of the Mutual Assurance Company, asking him to deliver them to Mr. or Mrs. Monson and saying that he had assigned them to Mrs. Monson for proper consideration and that she would be the person to whom the insurance money would be payable in the event of his death. On the same day he wrote a letter to Mrs. Monson assigning the policies and saying, " I am willing that you should hold the policies as security for all monies due to you from me, and as security against all liabilities incurred by you on my behalf, and in the event of my death occurring before the repayment of these monies you will be the sole beneficiary of these policies."

On Tuesday, 8th August, the day after the above two letters were written, a man arrived at Ardlamont in company with Mr. Monson. Ardlamont is only accessible from Glasgow and the Clyde by water, and the nearest pier to the house is at Kames, about four and a half miles off. This man, who travelled from Greenock by the same steamer as Mr. Monson, and who was apparently not familiar with the locality, left the steamer at Tighnabruaich, a pier about six miles from Ardlamont, and proceeded in the direction of Ardlamont by road. Mr. Monson, who landed at Karnes, drove back to meet him and brought him to the mansion-house, where he was introduced to the household as Scott, an engineer who had come to inspect the boilers of a yacht which Monson had purchased on behalf of Cecil. Scott took his meals with the family and was generally treated as a guest, although obviously not a gentleman in the social meaning of the word.

On the afternoon of Wednesday, 9th August, Monson and Scott went for a sail in a rowing boat, taking with them some of Mr. Monson's children. After dinner, at which Scott was present, the three men, Monson, Hambrough, and Scott, went down to Ardlamont Bay to engage in fishing. Monson and Cecil got into a boat in which was the net used for the fishing and Scott stayed on the shore. The party returned to the house about midnight, Monson and Cecil with their clothes soaked, both having somehow been immersed in the sea, but otherwise in good spirits and apparently treating the mishap as a joke. This misadventure was the cause of the Crown formulating the charge of attempted murder — the first head of the indictment under which Monson found himself in the dock. About six o'clock on the following morning, Thursday, 10th August, Mrs. Monson, accompanied by the governess and the children, left the house to go by boat to Glasgow for the day, and shortly afterwards Monson, Cecil, and Scott went out to shoot, Monson and Cecil each carrying a gun. The morning was wet and stormy. From the windows of the schoolhouse, which stands on the road to the mansion- house at the south end of the wood in which Cecil Hambrough met his death, the three men were seen by the witness Dunn walking along the road for a little in the direction of Ardlamont House and then crossing a fence to get into the field on the right-hand side of the road. After walking for a short distance in the field together, the three men were seen to spread out and enter the wood on the west side of the field in extended order, as if to beat the wood for rabbits, Scott, the man who had no gun, being in the middle. After entering the wood they were lost to Mr. Dunn's view, and nothing of them was again seen till some time after, when Monson and Scott returned to the house from the north end of the wood, passing the stables and offices on the way and bringing with them the two guns. On reaching the house Mr. Monson told the butler that Mr. Hambrough had been killed. The butler, accompanied by Monson and some of the estate servants, who were called upon to give assistance, went to the place where the body lay at the north end of the wood. It was found, with a gunshot wound in the head, lying on its back with the head towards the north, on the top of a sunk fence which divided the margin of the wood from a plantation of yoimg trees on the east. The sunk fence was about 4 1/2 feet in height, and at the bottom of it was a ditch overgrown by rank grass and bracken. The body was lifted and carried to the house, where the wound was washed. The local doctor was called in who, having examined the wound and received from Monson a statement as to the death, certified it as accidental. After luncheon Scott said that he had business to attend to which required that he should leave Ardlamont in the afternoon, and was told by the doctor that it was unnecessary for him to remain. He left by the afternoon boat for Glasgow and was not heard of again. Cecil Hambrough's father and mother were telegraphed for, and stayed at Ardlamont for two days. After their departure the body was taken by Monson to Ventnor, Isle of Wight, and was there buried, Monson returning to Ardlamont after the funeral. No suspicion was aroused as to the manner in which Cecil Hambrough had met his death until two officials of the Mutual Life Assurance Company came to Ardlamont on 23rd August to make inquiries concerning an application which had been made to the company for payment of the two insurance policies. They were taken by Monson to Inveraray to see the Procurator-Fiscal, and in consequence of what passed the Procurator-Fiscal began for the first time to look into the matter. The result of his inquiries was that he felt there was sufficient suspicion about the case to justify his putting the law in motion against Monson, and on 29th August Monson was arrested by the Chief Constable of Argyllshire. Orders were given for the exhumation of the body of Cecil Hambrough, and the examination following thereon resulted in a report hj the medical officer of the Crown and the doctor who had been called in at the time of the death, upon which a great part of the trial turned. Efforts were made both by the Crown and by Monson's legal advisers to find the man Scott, but without success ; not only were the utmost efforts of the police of the country unavailing, but also the advertisement which was widely made by Monson's law agent met with no response. Scott's connection with the matter yet remains the most inexplicable element of this mysterious case. Immediately after his arrest Mr. Monson called in the Iielp of Mr. John Blair, W.S., of Messrs. Davidson & Syme, Edinburgh, who, in due course, retained Mr. Comrie Thomson, Mr. John Wilson, and Mr. William Findlay, advocates, to conduct the case for the defence. Nearly three months were epent by those engaged in the case in preparing for the trial, and it was not till 12th December that Monson stood at the bar before the Lord Justice-Clerk and a jury to answer the charges made against him. Such, in brief outline, are the main facts of the story, the elucidation of which occupied the greater part of the ten days spent over the trial.

Before the trial actually began an interesting formality was gone through by the macer of Court calling upon Scott, the missing man, to appear ; upon his failing to do so, the judge passed sentence of outlawry against him.

As regards the first charge, namely, attempted murder by drowning late in the night of 9th August or early in the morning of the 10th, the theory of the Crown was that Monson took the boy out in a boat, in which he or Scott or both had previously cut a plug hole, and that when in deep water Monson removed the plug from the hole, with the result that the boat filled with water and sank, throwing them both into the sea, and that Monson, an expert swimmer, so attempted to drown the boy, who was unable to swim.

The defence explained the occurrence by saying that the hole was cut by Cecil himself for the purpose of emptying the boat of the water which accumulated during the course of fishing with the splash net, that Monson and the boy were thrown into the water by the boat capsizing through coming in contact with a rock, upon which Cecil clambered, and where he remained until Monson swam ashore and brought another boat to take him off. In his declaration on this matter Monson said — " So far from attempting on that evening to take young Hambrough's life, I consider that I saved it."

As regards the second charge, namely, that Cecil Hambrough met his death at the hand of another, and that other the prisoner at the bar, the Crown's theory was that he was killed by a glancing shot from a 12-bore gun, loaded with amberite powder, fired from behind at a distance of about 9 feet to the south of where he was standing at the time ; that he lay where he fell, and died from loss of blood. This 12-bore gun was admittedly the gun by which the fatal shot was fired and was not the gun which Cecil was in the habit of using, Monson at first stated that the boy was carrying a 20-bore gun, but subsequently stated that on the occasion of the accident he himself was carrying the boy's short 20-bore gun with, which Cecil usually shot, the latter having taken his (Monson's) 12-bore that morning in order to try new amberite cartridges.

In working out this theory many elements were taken into consideration, such as the nature and direction of the wound, the position of the body when first seen by others than Monson and Scott, and the traces of blood on the ground. Stress was also laid upon the position in which a blood-stained cartridge wad and two small pieces of bone, proved to be pieces of the skull, were found in relation to the body. Marks of pellets in trees to the northward of where the body was found lying afforded the main clue upon which was based the Crown theory as to the direction of the fatal shot and the distance from the deceased at which it was fired. Elaborate experiments to test such points as the spread of shot, the relation between the distance from which a shot is fired and the signs of discoloration and singeing in the object fired at, were explained in evidence and put to the jury as bearing out the theoiy that it was the prisoner's hand which had done Cecil Hambrough to death.

The defence, for their part, contended that the place where the body was seen by the butler and the others who went to carry it to the house was not the place where it was first found by Monson and Scott, and that they had lifted it from the ditch where it was lying and placed it upon the higher level of the sunk fence. That being so, they argued, the Crown theory as to the line of fire fell to the ground, and Mr. Comrie Thomson very pertinently pointed out in his address to the jury that the position of the body when seen by the witnesses, namely, lying on its back with the head pointing north, and upon which the Crown's case was largely founded, was utterly inconsistent with the theory that it had been shot from behind and from the south and that it lay where it fell.

As has been already indicated, the motive for the alleged crime assigned by the Crown was the prisoner's belief that by causing the death of Cecil Hambrough he would, through his wife — to whom the insurance policies over the boy's life purported to be assigned — reap the benefit of these policies, amounting to the large sum of £20,000. It was proved beyond doubt that the Monsons were literally penniless at the time and entirely dependent upon such small doles as they were able to get from their friend Tottenham and others ; it was argued that Monson, in ignorance of the elementary rule of law in Scotland as in England, that a minor cannot make a valid assignment without the consent of his guardians, believed that the assignment of the policies was good ; and that the death of Cecil Hambrough was the coping-stone of a deeply laid scheme by which Monson sought to rehabilitate his broken- down financial condition.

The defence met this theory by arguing that the prisoner was well aware of the boy's incapacity to assign before attaining majority and of the impossibility of Mrs. Monson recovering anything under the policies if Cecil died before twenty-one. In explanation of the letters relating to the assignment, it was argued that they were to be read merely as a declaration of indebtedness by Cecil, which could be referred to when the boy came of age, so that the Monsons might secure repayment of the advances which they had undoubtedly made to both the boy and his father and get discharge of Monson's bill for board and education, towards which he had not received one penny from Major Hambrough during the long time the boy was a member of his household. The defence admitted that a claim had been made to the insurance company after Cecil Hambrough's death, but Mr. Tottenham, who made the claim on behalf of Mrs. Monson, admitted in the witness-box that in doing so he was trying to " bluff " the insurance company into paying the money, £4000 of which he was to receive, by agreement with Monson, as his share of the spoil. The defence summed up their position on the matter of motive by pointing out that Monson had everything to lose and nothing to gain by the death of the boy before he reached the age of twenty-one, and that if the prisoner wished by his death to gain pecuniary advantage he killed him some months too soon and chose the very worst time for doing the boy to death.

These theories for the prosecution and the defence, of which an outline has been given, were put to the jury by the Solicitor- General and by Mr. Comrie Thomson in speeches which were worthy of the importance of the case. That of the Solicitor- General was a model of skilful forensic oratory, marked by great sincerity and at the same time by that fairness which, it is hoped, will always remain a characteristic note in the speeches of the law officers of the Crown in Scotland. Mr. Comrie Thomson's address on behalf of the prisoner worthily Upheld the high standard set by Lord President Inglis in his speech in defence of Madeleine Smith, the opening w^ords of which, it is interesting to note, were quoted by Mr. Comrie Thomson. In urging upon the jury the necessity of bringing to the discharge of their duty an unprejudiced mind, Mr. Comrie Thomson referred in strong terms to the hostile attitude taken up by the press of the country towards the prisoner from the date of his arrest.

The Lord Justice-Clerk, in his careful and exhaustive charge to the jury, gave due prominence to the many doubts and difficulties in the case which the prosecution had left unsolved, and then the jury retired to consider their verdict. On their return to Court the foreman announced that the verdict of the jury was " not proven " on both charges. The prisoner was released from the dock and passed quietly out of Court, and the great trial came to an end. The Ardlamont mystery was still a mystery, and so it is likely to remain for a long time to come.

An echo of the case was heard in May of the following year, when the mysterious Scott appeared in an Edinburgh music-hall as part of a conjurer's equipment, and during his stay in Edinburgh petitioned the High Court of Justiciary to recall the sentences of outlawry against him, which was done, the Crown putting in no appearance against him.

The Ardlamont Mystery. The Missing 'Scott.' (By *Telegraph*.)

LANGHOLM, Noon.— A bookmaker answering to the description of 'Scott' attended Haithwaitegate Coursing Meeting on November 24th. The meeting is held about seven miles from Langholm and thirteen from Carlisle. The man was in very delicate health, and did his work very quietly. It is also now known to the police authorities that a man of precisely the same description was in lodgings in Carlisle for nearly a week the beginning of this month, and that he disappeared without paying his lodgings. His landlady states that he was evidently a betting man, and seldom stirred out till night. His only luggage was a handbag. He mentioned names to her the same as those which have since appeared in the evidence at the trial The description of this man tallies very exactly with that subsequently published of "Scott," and he appeared to be a stranger the coursing meeting.

Criticism of the "Not Proven" Verdict— The Benefit of the Doubt.

The Ardlamont case has caused merits of the verdict of "not proven" to be discussed in the Temple, says a legal critic in the *Globe*. There is much to be said both for and against it, but, on the whole, the feeling is opposed to it. A verdict of "not proven" inevitably means social ruin the person of whom is returned, but if the jury cannot make their minds that the prisoner is guilty is it right that they should be able to inflict this punishment upon him ? In giving the prisoner the benefit of tha doubt they express the doubt so severely that there is little moral benefit in it. It is claimed, on the other hand, that the Scotch system is more humane than our own, because in several cases in which English juries have returned a verdict of guilty, trusting the Home Secretary to mitigate the sentence of death, a Scotch jury would have brought in a verdict of "not proven." In more than one famous criminal trial in Scotland the jury have returned a verdict of " not proven" by a majority. Such was the result of the well-known case of Smith, who was accused of shooting a young farmer, upon whose life he held a policy of insurance. On this occasion the judge ventured to do what very few occupants of the bench have done. After the jury had returned their verdict, he asked whether they were divided between "not proven" and "guilty" or between "not proven " and "not guilty." He was informed that the difference had arisen upon the former alternative. Clearly this was a most improper question to address to the jury, and only on very rare occasions has such inquiry been made.

Uttoxeter New Era - Wednesday 27 December 1893


THE ARDLAMONT MYSTERY

Herewith we give a portrait of the missing Scott for whose arrest a reward of £200 is offered by the police in connection with the Ardlamont tragedy. Concerning Scott a strange story reaches us from Londonderry. A hairdresser in that town states that a person answerting to the official description of the missing man called at his shop on November 15 and had his moustache shaved off. The man's demeanout was uneasy. Questioned as to why he was having his moustache shaved off he explained that he was carrying out a joke, and gave the address of a friend, which turns out to be false. The hairdresser is firmly of opinion that Scott is no other than the stranger he shaved.

IMAGE - TO DO

The hunt for Scott, however, seems to be going forward less keenly because it is noiseless. It is only natural, perhaps, that all sorts of rumours should be floating in the air. Thus it was announced in least one quarter on Saturday, of course from the usual "trustworthy source," that the fugitive might even yet be caught— "if the information received by authorities is correct."  "If" is at all times a pretty safe qualification. The actual fact is, at the time of the receipt of the intelligence on which these remarks are founded, that no official tidings have come to hand of the capture of the one man who is needed to complete the cycle of the Ardlamont mystery.

SCOTT IN CARLISLE

HE WAS ALLOWED TO SLIP AWAY — HIS LANDLADY's STORY

Interest in the Ardlamont case seems to be sustaining itself day by day by means of the missing man Scott. The Press Association's Carlisle correspondent states that on 19 Dec. a woman who lets lodgings in Carlisle reported to the city police that a man answering to the description of Scott, and evidently a betting man, had lodged at her house from 30 Nov. to 5 Dec., when he left without paying for his lodgings. He carried a revolver, and spoke of persons afterwards named in the Ardlamont case, and seldom went out until the evening. The Chief Constable forwarded the information to the Chief Constable of Argyllshire, but the man had then been gone a fortnight.

It is now placed beyond doubt (according to the Central News) that Scott has been staying in Carlisle. He attended Haithwaite Gate coursing meeting in North Cumberland, and before that he was seen in Newcastle by betting men who knew him. He is well known in Carlisle, where he has attended race meetings.

On the 2nd inst. Scott attended service in a Methodist chapel with his landlord. On the following Tuesday he was much upset on hearing his landlady read from a newspaper the report that a warrant had been issued for the arrest of Scott, and he decamped the same night after buying some collars and ties. It is supposed that he took a train for the south.

London Evening Standard - Saturday 30 December 1893

THE ARDLAMONT MYSTERY. SUPPOSED SUICIDE OF SCOTT

Some excitement was caused to-day in the neighbourhood of Old Ford-road, Bow, by a report that the missing man Sweeney or Scott, who is wanted in connection with the Ardlamout mystery, had committed suicide in a lodging-house near by. It appears that early yesterday morning a man whose description tallies with that circulated by the police with reference to Scott, applied for a bed at a common lodginghouse in Old Ford-road. He was accommodated, and apparently fell asleep till 10.30 a.m., when a boy who occupied the next bed spoke to him. He answered the boy, and appeared rather excited, but no notice was taken of that, nor was anything thought of it till later in the day, when the landlady on going into the room found him lying in bed in a pool of blood. She at once communicated with the police, and Police-constable Clark, 247 K, was quickly on the spot. He found the man dead, and on examining the bed saw a British bull-dog revolver lying near his right hand, the muzzle pointing towards the Deceased's head on which just over the temple was a bullet wound. The Coroner was informed, and his officer removed the body to the Bow Mortuary. The police have circulated the following description :--Age about 33 ; length, 5ft. 9in. ; complexion, fair; hair and moustache, brown ; eyes: grey, one (the right) discoloured. He was dressed in a dark grey mixture coat and vest, dark striped trousers. military braces marked 55063 R.A. 1C35[?], dark flannel shirt, light grey ??, white collar, black satin scarf, black hard felt hat, marked "G. C. Davis, hatters, 25[?]6, Strand," white handkerchief, marked "H and 3-203," four gold studs, and white pocket knife with three blades. This description being almost the same as that supplied of the missing man, the police are now trying to find the firneds of Scott, with the view to their seeing the body of the dead man.

The woman with whom the man suspected to be Scott lodged in Carlisle made a further statement yesterday bearing upon her lodger's identity. She says he wore on his watch chain a silver medal engraved with the letters "E. D." On being questioned as to these initials, which differed from those of Joseph Thompson, the name by which he was known, he said they meant " Edward Davies," which name he had borne until 16 years old, adding that he had three or four names. On Tuesday, the 5th December, he turned scarlet when his landlady read out to him a reward was offered for the capture of Scott. He at once read the announcenient himself, and said he was going to the post-office to stop his letters front coming there. He left the same day without paying for his lodgings. The landlady further states that he had a deep scar on the left jaw, and that the right forefinger was wanting from the second joint. He had blue eyes and sallow complexion. In an illustrated paper there was a portrait of Scott reproduced from a photo, and that portrait she said was the very image of her lodger, except that the portrait had a moustache, whereas her lodger had none, but was growing one.

Mr. Thomas McNaughton, the Inverary official who had charge of the Ardlamont case, has, in consequence of the recent observations of Monson in reference to the prosecution, written to the *Scotsman*, stating exactly what was done by the officials. It was on August 10 that the Procurator Fiscal was informed of Lieutenant Hambrough's death. "On August 11, with the earliest opportunity available, I proceeded to Ardlamont, arriving there in the evening, accompanied by a police officer, who had previously handed me his report embodying the mresult of his inquiries, and also the result of the doctor's examination. I, on the evening of the same day, examined and took down in writing the statements of the witnesses, who were said to have first seen the body after the alarm was given by Monson. I also examined Monson. I then proceeded to the *locus*, which was pointed out to me by Monson, after which I returued to Ardlamont House and made an examiniation of the wound in deceased's head, thereafter returning to Tighnabruaich. The following day I had to proceed to other parts of the county on official business, and was unable to return to Inverary until the afternoon of August 15th, when I reported the result of my inquiries to the Porcurator Fiscal, who the following morning communmicated with the Glasgow officials, fully stating the case, and requesting them to take a minute and careful deposition from 'Scott,' and if not found at the address given to wire at once. Bit the Glasgow authorities failed to find the man, and stated so by wire and letter. On receipt of the letter, the constable at Tighnabruaich was wired by the Procurator Fiscal to proceed to Ardlamont and ascertain from Monson 'Scott's' whereabouta. Wires were received on the following day, August 22, both from the constable and Monson, stating that the latter would call next day, August 23, and explain matters. On the latter date Monson arrived, accompanied by Mr. Tottenham and the two insurance officials, and had an interview with the Procurator Fiscal and myself. The object of the visit, I learned, was not to give any information regarding 'Scott's' whereabouts, but for another purpose in connection with insurance. Next day the Procurator Fiscal and myself proceeded to Tighnabruaich and took further evidence. We returned the following day to Inverary and communicated at once with the proper authorities for instructions." As to what Monson said respecting Mr. McNaughton, this official desires simply to point out that it is untrue. "I beg to characterise it as a deliberate untruth that I was at Ardlamont on August 10, and it follows that I could not possibly have, as Monson says I might have done, wired to have 'Scott' stopped on the arrival of the boat, and have asked him to return. It will be understood that I am precluded from giving any information as to what Monson's statements to me were as to 'Scott' and other matters; and, further, that in the early stages of the inquiry it was impossible to verify or contradict any information obtained from Monson."

Exmouth Journal - Saturday 14 April 1894

THE ARDLAMONT MYSTERY , scarfs STORY OP THE TRLOEDY• In the Pall Mall Gazette, Scott, the witness who was wanted but could not be found during the investigation of the Ardlamont case, relates the story of ' the death of Lieutenant Hambrough. Scott, according to the account he gives, was roused soon after • daybreak on the morning "f August 10 to go out on the rabbit shooting expedition which had so fatal an ending. The trio had not proceeded far in the wood when Monson and Hambrough separated Scott keeping in the rear to pick up the dead rabbits —when he heard a single shot fired. He called out something to the effect, " what have you got 7" He received no reply, and concluded it was a miss. In a very short time he caught up with Mr. Monson, and about 15 or 20 yards further on the lifeless body of the ill-fated Cecil Hambrough was found. According to Scott, "shortly after midday it was an undoubted, admitted fact, that Mr. Hambrough had met his death by an accidentally self-inflicted wound caused by the going off of his own gun." As to his disappearance from Ardlamoot, he declares that having ascertained from Dr. MacMillan that there would be no inquest, he left the place quite openly, speaking of the accident to a policeman on the pier at Tighnabruaich, and giving that officer his Glasgow address.

THE ARDLAMONT MYSTERY. OFFERED SURRENDER OF SCOTT.

Scott, the man who disappeared when the Ardlamomt mystery aroused so much comment, offered to surrender, on Thursday, to the police in London. He has made a declaration to the effect that his name is Edward Sweeney, that at one time he was known as Ted Davies, bookmaker, that in August last year, under the name of Scott, be passed three days at Ardlamont, as Hanson's guest, and that he is the person against whom a warrant was issued for the alleged murder of Cecil Hambrough.

The Press Association says :—" The attempt to impart significance to the appearance of Scott has by no means disturbed the equanimity of the London police authorities. Scott is not in custody, and at present the Scotland Yard authorities have no intention of depriving him of his liberty. Such a course will entirely depend upon the Procurator-Fiscal in Edinburgh who will, it is expected, decide what course will be adopted."

THE ARDLAMONT MYSTERY. "THE DISAPPEARING MAN."

Edward Sweeney, *alias* Davis, *alias* Scott, who was charged along with Monson in the Ardlamont case, and who at the time absconded, is at present residing in Edinburgh, for the purpose of taking steps to have the sentence of outlawry passed upon him removed. He has presented a petition to the High Court of Justiciary stating that he is not guilty of the charge of murder then preferred against him, and that he is now ready to meet it. The authorities will, however, have nothing to do with him. His petition has been served on the Lord Advocate, and will probably come before the court when it meets this week, but the likelihood is that no appearance will be made for the Crown, and that the prayer of the petition, in the absence of opposition, will be granted, and the sentence of outlawry removed. In the meantime " Scott" seems inclined to turn his notoriety to good account. He enters to-day on a week's engagement at the Empire Palace Theatre, where he appears in Professor Morritt's illusion as "The disappearing man."

The Scotsman - Tuesday 22 May 1894

YESTERDAY, Mr Edward Sweeney, *alias* Scott, had his sentenco of outlawry recalled. Mr Sweeney, it will be remembered, was present at Ardlamont House on the morning that young Hambrough was shot. He was there under the name of Scott, and he had been introduced to different persons as an engineer. He was not an engineer, and his name, as we know, was not Scott. He has explained how it came about that he was represented as an engineer, and how he took the name of Scott, and that explanation has no doubt been weighed by the public. It was not given at the trial of Monson on a charge of murdering Hambrough. Sweeney was indicted along with Monson and as he did not appear, a sentence of outlawry was pronounced against him. The Crown sought to get evidence into the trial to prove that the Scott who was present at Ardlamont was Mr Sweeney, and it was not permitted. The police had been searching for Mr Sweeney for many weeks, and had not found him. He turned up subsequently at the instance of a London newspaper ; and now he has come to Scotland to ask that the sentence of outlawry against him shall be recalled. His request was granted yesterday under some peculiar conditions. The Court had no opportunity of learning what the Crown thought on the subject. Sentence of outlawry had bean pronounced against Mr Sweeney at the instance of the Crown. His petition for a recall of the sentence had been intimated to the Crown officials. Yesterday had been appointed for the hearing of the petition ; and when he came before the High Court of Justiciary no representative of the Crown was present, and not a word of guidance was given to the Court by any one on behalf of the Crown. Most properly this course was strongly commented upon by the Lord Justice-Clerk and by Lord Adam. They said that it seemed to be a dereliction of duty on ths part of the Crown. What they said will have the approval of the country. It should be remembered that the Judges who sit on the bench have only to administer the law. It is tha business of the Crown to bring to the knowledge of the bench all the facts it can gather in reference to any and every case that comes into Court in connection with criminal matters. If this be not done, the Judges are left almost entirely without guidance, and obviously there may be a serious miscarriage of justice. We are not saying or suggesting that anything of the kind has taken place in regard to this case ; but it must be said that the absence of the Crown from the hearing of the petition placed the Judges in a position in which they ought not to have been left. Mr Sweeney has got his sentence of outlawry recalled, and has thereby made another precedent in the administration of criminal law in Scotland. It may be hoped that the Crown's dealing with the question will not be regarded as a precedent to be followed in the future.

Mr. Charles Morritt's appearance at St. George's Hall, after an absence of many years, has awakened many recollections of his earlier career in the magical world. It was Mr. Morritt who invented the illusion of "The Disappearing Lady," and afterwards caused a sensation during the period of the Ardlamont mystery, by producing Scott, "the missing man," on the stage, when scores of people were scouring the land in search of him.

...


GLASGOW

Gaiety.— Charles Morritt, in his illusion "The Missing Man", is the centre of attraction at this hall. The "missing man" is no other than "Scott", of Ardlamont mystery fame, his reception being of a very mixed character. The illusion, however, is good; the disappearance only occupying five seconds.
