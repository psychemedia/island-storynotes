A MONSON RELIC.

The laying of Monson by the heels has created fresh interest in the Ardlamont case at Tighnabruaich, the little West of Scotland village which is the post town for the mansion house in the grounds of which Hambrough met his death, and the evidence of the famous murder trial Edinburgh is being rediscussed with vigour. A relic of the proceedings is still the town—the boat in which Monson and Hambrough went the nocturnal fishing excursion which almost proved fatal to the swindler's young pupil. The boat, which, in bits, was one of the productions at the trial, but has since been neatly put together, is duly hired by visitors, to whom the proprietor points out the hole which led to suspicions being aroused that the filling of the craft was not merely an accident.

MONSON IN THE DOCK

ASSOCIATE'S ASTOUNDING STORIES

ALLEGED REMARKABLE FRAUDS.

On Monday Alfred John Monson stepped smiling into the dock at Bow-street Police-court charged with conspiracy to defraud, as about years ago he stopped with a look of satisfaction

[ILLUSTRATION MONSON. HONOUR.]

from the dock at Edinburgh when the jury had found a verdict of "Not Proven" to the indictment against him of murdering Lieutenant Cecil Hambrough.

Monson now stands charged, with Victor Honour, the Charing Cross money-lender (who recently figured in the case against the Hon. John Tyrwhitt), and two men named Norgate and Metcalf, with passing a healthy man off in place of an unhealthy man, and thereby fraudulently securing a life policy from the Norwich Union Insurance Company.

Inspector Arrow, a Vine-street detective, said that he received the warrants on the previous Friday. The same evening he had a telegram from Norgate and next morning a letter in which Norgate promised to surrender, and he did so that afternoon.

Monson, continued the inspector, was arrested on Saturday evening as he was  
WALKING DOWN PICCADILLY. 
with a dressing-bag. The bag was packed for travelling, and Monson said he was "just off to the North." On hearing the warrant read, all Monson said was: "What, Honour too! No bail, I suppose?" All the papers and books at his rooms in Arundel-street, Haymarket, were subsequently taken possession of. The same evening Honour was taken into custody at his office, 131, Jermyn-street, and a quantity of papers found in his safe and cupboard were seized. Honour was more curious. He asked who granted the warrant and who the prosecutor was. When asked what his occupation was, Honour replied, "I was a money-lender. Since a couple of months I have given it up and am buying property now and building."

Metcalf was arrested late on Saturday night and gave his name as Robert Ives Metcalf, and admitted that in 1896 he was a member of the firm of Lumley, of 148, Shaftesbury-avenue.

When the charge was read over in the presence of all four, Norgate said, "I understand" ; Monson, "I see"; Honour, "it's a lie" ; Metcalf, "Yes."

Mr. Arthur Newton, who appeared for the defence of Honour, reserved his cross-examination.

Mr. F. W. Tonkin, defending Monson and Norgate elicited from the inspector that he had been in communication with Norgate since as long ago as March, had seen Norgate by appointment frequently, and had  
INFORMATION FROM HIM.  
Witness believed that the insurance company had taken proceedings in Chancery and got the policy set aside. When asked if the company did not decline to prosecute, he said he knew that at first they were anxious to do so. He had always regarded Norgate as a prospective witness for the prosecution, but had made no

[ILLUSTRATION P. NORGATE. METCALF.]

promise to him to get him out of the dock. Witness had also been in communieation with Monson, who likewise had given information which had been laid before the Public Prosecutor, and from a telegram found on Monson he believed that Monson was "going North," only In the ordinary way of business, and not to avoid arrest.

NOT THE ONLY CASE.

Application being made for bail, Mr. Avory said that this was only a sample of cases which came to light all over the country, and bail was refused, except in the of Norgate—two sureties of £100 each—and the prisoners were remanded without any date for their reappearance being fixed.

NORGATE'S STARTLING STORY.

The little Extradition Court at Bow-street was crowded to excess when Monson, Norgate, Metcalf, and Honour were again put in the dock on Friday.

When the prisoners filed into the dock Mr. Avory at once announced that he proposed to call Norgate as a witness, and he was formally discharged.

Mr. Avory then opened a terrible indictment against the three prisoners.

He said that Honour, besides being a 6O per cent. money-lender, had been "frequently the cause of young men who have fallen into his clutches forging the names of relatives, he holding the documents as instruments for the levying of blackmail."

As to Alfred J. Monson, Mr. Avery said he had acted as a tout for Honour, and had also been in business with Metcalf and a man named Stanley Hobson, who has disappeared. They were "insurance agents" at 164, Shaftesbury-avenue, as Lumley and Co.

NORGATE FORGED HIS MOTHER'S NAME.

In the summer of 1894 Norgate forged his mother's name to an acceptance, at Honour's instigation, for £10. From this small starting-point the debt to Honour grew and the forgeries increased in number.

Last year Honour suggested that Norgate should insure his life. Norgate knew he would not be accepted by any company, but Honour introduced him to Monson under the name of Wyville, and Monson said that he would arrange the matter. Metcalf, then working for Monson, introduced himself to the Norwich Union as an agent, and followed up the introduction by producing a man, probably Stanley Hobson, as Norgate, and effected  
AN INSURANCE OF £2,000 ON HIS LIFE.

An interesting point came when Mr. Avory told of Honour's attempt to get Norgate to sign his name as Stanley Hobson had done.

"Take away this piece of paper and practice it at home," were the words Honour is said to have used. As Mr. Avory repeated them, the stout little Hebrew stood up in the box and shook his head, affecting to smile.

By threatening Norgate to serve a writ on his mother on account of the forged acceptances Honour induced the unfortunate young man to sign an ante-dated letter, saying that he was the one who passed the insurance doctor.

In spite of a written assurance that he would not, Honour issued the writ in October, 1886. Norgate thereupon went to the Norwich Union and told all about the fraud.

Mr. Avory then told an extraordinary story of a visit of Monsen, in the guise of the elder brother of Hobson, to the father and mother of Norgate at St. Ives, by which he extracted £210 from them to compromise the case of the forged acceptances.

DOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE.

Letters and documents substantiating the charges were found when the police examined the office after the arrest of the prisoners.

NORGATE'S STORY.

There was a stir in court when Percival Edward Norgate went into the box. He gave his age as twenty-eight in April this year. At the end of 1893 he first borrowed money from Honour, who was then carrying on business as Dent, at 26, Moorgate-street, and as Shakespeare, at 17, Canonbury-villas. About July, 1894, he borrowed £40, for which he gave promissory notes.

"He told me," said the witness, "to sign it 'R. Norgate' at the hbck of these bills. I had already told him my mother's name Rachel. He said they would never be used, and I could pay them when and how I liked. I then got about £10 in cash, and some old promissory notes back again."

Between this date and the end of 1894 Norgate signed other acceptances in the same way in his mother's name. By the end of 1894 the debt amounted to £96.

Honour was aware that  
HIS FATHER WAS A CLERGYMAN,  
said the witness.

About January, 1695, Honour commenced proceedings in the Mayor's Court on one of the bills which he had accepted in the name of his father, E. Norgate. His mother came up to Moorgate-street, and paid Honour £20, promising to pay £60 in two weeks to settle the rest. They went together to Canonbury and paid it.

During 1895 Norgate went back to Honour for more money, with the result that in January, 1896, he held more bills signed in the names of his father and mother.

Three letters were put in by Mr. Avory which the witness identified as being written by himself

AT HONOURS DICTATION.

They did not refer to his bills at all, but to forged bills in the names of two men, Atkins and Herbert, which he had endorsed at Honour's request.

As chiefly interested in these preliminary inquiries, Honour remained standing in the dock, Monson and Metcalf sitting down. The moneylender wrote notes on blue paper to his solicitor, and very kindly passed one down to the Press, containing the correct spelling of "Urbanousky," one of his moneylending aliases.

Norgate said that when Honour suggested insuring his life for £200 he told him he could not pass the doctor of any insurance company. Honour said he could be insured without medical examination.

Honour then introduced Norgate to Monson, calling the latter Wyville, and to Metcalf, as Lumley and Co., insurance agents, of Shaftesbury-avenue, saying they would obtain the policy for him. Metcalf mentioned Hobson at this time as a partner in the firm.

Norgate now told of a meeting with Monson at the Victoria Hotel, Panton-street, at which he was told that his life had been insured for £200. was given £3 and told that it was his share of a commission which Monson as agent had received. Metcalf received money also as his share.

They then went to Honour's office. There witness was asked to sign his name to an assignment of the policy. He signed once, but Honour said, "That won't do. Make your signature like this," at the same time handing him a piece of paper.

REMANDED.

Prisoners were remanded without bail.

MONSON'S STRANGE CAREER

THE ARDLAMONT MYSTERY AND ITS SEQUEL

BY OUR SPECIAL CRIME INVESTIGATOR.

Monson's career when it is written will contain many startling details, for it is common knowledge that ever since the Ardlamont Mystery the officers of Scotland Yard have kept an eye upon the prisoner who left the dock upon the returning by the jury of a verdict of "Not proven." It is now five years since Monson stood in the dock, the leading figure in a sensational insurance mystery charged with murder. A brief résumé of the facts will not be out of place.

A young man named Cecil Hambrough, who had expectations, was desirous of entering the militia as an officer, and he engaged as his tutor in order to prepare for his examination Alf John Monson. Young Hambrough spent money freely, and having gone through the allowance made him by his father, was forced to borrow money of Monson, who in turn borrowed it of someone else. In order that there should be some sort of security for these loans, various policies of assurance upon his life were taken out amounting to nearly £20,000, which the young man, in the summer of 1893, assigned over to Mrs. Monson.

Soon after the assignment young Hambrough, whilst in company with his tutor, Monson, met with a somewhat strange misadventure. Accompanied by a man named Scott, introduced by Monson, Hambrough and his tutor went for a day's fishing in a boat. As darkness came on the boat suddenly filled with water and sank, leaving the three occupants to be carried away by the stream. Fortunately, all of them reached the shore, young Hambrough with some difficulty, but it is to be observed that he received but little assistance from Monson or Scott.

The very next day Hambrough, with Scott and Monson, went out rabbit shooting, and was found subsequently dead, having received the charge of a gun in his head. Scott disappeared from Ardlamont, and Monson asserted that the lieutenant must have shot himself, perhaps accidentally. Young Hambrough was mourned by his friends and buried, but was afterwards exhumed when Monson was arrested and charged with murder, the trial lasting nearly a fortnight.

On behalf of the Crown it was urged that the boat "accident" had been deliberately arranged, a hole having been cut by either Monson or Scott, and that in the darkness in the Ardlamont Bay the plug in the hole was removed deliberately in order to drown young Hambrough. Finding this attempt abortive the Crown alleged that Monson or Scott tock Cecil Hambrough out rabbit shooting, and shot him in order to obtain the £20,000 for which he was insured. Eventually the jury returned a verdict of "Not proven." The policies, having been improperly effected, were after a great deal of litigation, set aside, and Monson received nothing.

Monson then came before the public pre-eminently by reason of various actions taken by a person who is stated to have lent him money. It then became known that he had been mixed up with money-lenders and was in the habit of introducing business to insurance offices.

Monson and Honour have "worked "together for some years, and Monson's "introductione" have frequently been before the public, notably in the case of the Hon. John Tyrwhitt, a youth of twenty-one, who was indicted in May this year at the Old Bailey for uttering a forged cheque for £64. Young Tyrwhitt had been in the habit of borrowing money from Honour, to whom he was brought by Monson. Mr. Geoghegan defended the prisoner and cross-examined Honour as to his numerous transactions, and suggested that Monson had been the instigator of the forgery. Honour replied that he knew nothing of Monson "only in business," but he refused to call him as a witness. Monson, who was in court, sitting by my side, jumped up and said he was prepared to say what he knew about the cheque, but Sir Forrest Fulton ordered him not to disturb the proceedings, and suggested that he had better leave the court. Strangely enough at this trial Honour, who said he was an Austrian Jew, born in Germany, declined to be sworn, electing to affirm. The judge remarked that it was the first time he had ever known a Jew refuse to be sworn. The jury after Mr. Geoghegan's cross-examination, made up their minds that there was not sufficient evidence to establish the forgery and returned a verdict of "Not guilty."

Recently Monson and Honour quarrelled, and have done but little business together, Monson transferring his custom to a gentleman who is said to be in some way mixed up with the Tangiers Insurance Mystery, where a man named Callan is charged with attempting to murder a young gentleman named Birkin, whose life is insured for £50,000.

Honour is a man of considerable means, the owner of freehold property, and a big banking balance. For some years past he has had a great many agents at work for him, securing him young men as customers.

Mr. Avery said, in opening the case on Friday, that it was not a question of Honour's victims paying him 60 per cent., but 6,000 per cent., and that when once they got into his clutches they were never left until completely ruined. Honour had been conducting a number of money-lending offices under various aliases in different parts of London.

Monson, when he stepped into the dock at Bow-street, was found to be exceedingly well dressed, wearing diamond sleeve links and studs with several diamond rings on his fingers, one with the letter M in diamonds and rubies.
