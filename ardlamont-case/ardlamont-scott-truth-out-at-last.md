THE TRUTH OUT AT LAST. BY SCOTT (the Missing Man).

How and Why I went to Ardlamont, the Story of the Boat Incident, the Death of Mr. Hambrough, and my subsequent Disappearance and Adventures when charged with Murder. By EDWARD SWEENEY (the Missing Man himself).

PREFACE.

IN publishing this, the true account of the Great Ardlamont Mystery which for a period of four months occupied the attention of almost every man, woman, and child in the United Kingdom, I make ... TO DO

but one apology-namely, to the British public for the delay in putting before them the facts within my own knowledge of that most unhappy and unfortunate occurrence which should (had not the Scotch law authorities by their action in charging me with an atrocious crime, without one particle of evidence to justify them in doing so) have been published long since. I make no claim to literary powver s, but will (1o my best to show by my statement ?? by one mistake (I mean my harmless adoption of a name other than that by which I was commonly known on the turf for reasons which I will cxplain) I woke up to find myself involved in a mystery, charged with murder, hunted like a dog with a price upon my head, declared an outlaw, and doomed to suffer more than by my poor ability I can ever hope to make my readers appreciate.

I'm happy to help extract the text from the newspaper scans you provided. Here is the text extracted as precisely as possible:

"Dense their hospitality to those whose acquaintance they make while following the pastime of racing, will understand that there is nothing strange, or in fact peculiar, in an invitation being given by a gentleman of position and means to a bookmaker to visit him at his sporting residence and enjoy with him a few days' holiday and recreation; and such was the nature of the pressing and kindly invitation received by me, Edward Davis, the bookmaker, from Mr. Alfred Monson, my client and patron, in the summer of 1833.

My acquaintance with Mr. Monson was of no great standing, having commenced some time about the month of May in that year, when he was introduced to me quite casually as a young swell with plenty of money and a great liking for horse-racing and betting, and therefore a most desirable gentleman for me to cultivate and do business with, and, to be perfectly frank, as I shall endeavour to be throughout my story, one from whom I desired and hoped to benefit considerably, and I must say that those few transactions on the turf which I have had with him have been to my own, and, I trust, our mutual satisfaction.

As I have said, it was in or about the month of May when I first met Mr. Monson, and between that time and August I saw him, perhaps, half a dozen times. At the latter end of July I was in London, and accidentally met my racing friend, with whom I had some conversation on the usual topic, and it was at this meeting he informed me with evident pride and pleasure that he was about to enter into possession of what I understood to be his new sporting estate in Scotland.

Here let me at once state that at this time I did not know of the existence of Mr. Hambrough, and had never seen or heard of that young gentleman. I mention this to correct an error which is prevalent, to the effect that Hambrough was known to me; but such is not the case. Mr. Monson was my client and patron, and was, I thought what is termed a "swell," for as such he passed and acted.

At that meeting in London, some time during the latter part of July, Mr. Monson invited me to come to visit him at Ardlamont, and his invitation and the promised welcome were so kindly insisted upon that it was out of the question to refuse.

I accepted the offer, and it was arranged that I should set out for Scotland about the 7th or 8th of August, when Mr. Monson hoped to be in Glasgow, where we could meet and journey on to Ardlamont together."

"While sampling Mr. Donald's prescription the steamer came alongside a pier, which I understood was our destination; so tumbling up on deck I sought out and collected my luggage, and thinking my host had gone ashore ahead of me, left the steamer by the gangway. But on my arrival on the pier I could not see Mr. Monson, and then I learned on inquiry that that I had made a mistake in getting off at Tighnaibruaich, instead of waiting until the steamer arrived at the next pier, the proper one for Kames, our destination. On realizing my mistake, or, more properly speaking, the error of Mr. Monson, in saying to me "Here we are," before he had assured himself of the name of the pier the steamer was alongside, and upon ascertaining the distance between Tighnaibruaich and Kames, I found a trap to drive to the latter; and whilst being so driven by the lad McPhee, the boots of the Tighnaibruaich Hotel, we met Mr. Monson, coming to look for me in his dogcart, which had evidently been waiting to meet him on the arrival of the steamer at Kames.

Mr. Monson was pleasant as usual over my mistake, and directed his coachman to put my luggage in the dogcart, and off we drove to Ardlamont.

During the drive from the steamer to the house Mr. Monson mentioned the difficulty he felt in introducing me as Mr. Davis, the bookmaker, to his wife and any other ladies or guests who might come to Ardlamont, apologizing at the same time for having called me out of my name to Mr. Donald, and the occurrence was, as near as I can recollect, discussed in such a way as I quite understood, discussed in a more or less jocular strain; "Look here, old fellow, it will never do for me to introduce you to my wife as Ted Davis the bookmaker, so you mustn't mind if I say you are something else, for I feel sure she would make a fuss about it. Not that she herself would care; but you know some people are funny about the turf, and think any one connected with it must be a wretched fellow."

"Call me Juggins."

I replied: It don't matter a jot to me what you call me, so long as you don't make a fool of me. You can call me Juggins or Muggins if you like, but it is no use my trying to be a fool, for I am a sportsman, and know as much about racing as most men that's all I know of sport. Can't you say I've come up on business and you have asked me to stay?"

Mr. Monson: I know, old chap. I will introduce you as the engineer come to look at the engines of the yacht for me, and that will be all right if you don't mind.

I replied: Do as you like, but if they get me on about the engineering you mustn't blame me if I give you away.

Mr. Monson: Oh, that'll be all right, old chap; we won't talk any shop, so let's remember you are, say, Mr. Edward Scott, the engineer, about the engines of the yacht, the Alert, which I am just going to have fitted."

"After this conversation I must confess I did feel a little relieved, for I myself felt a little bit out of place going up to Scotland for the 12th August, presumably for the shooting, without any gun or anything of the sort, and I had more than once thought over my position if I should be asked to join in any shooting party, for it is an art of shooting, never having possessed a gun or shot one off in my life, and at the same time I will confess that I am no athlete, and can neither shoot, fish, row, nor swim—four very useful and general accomplishments which I have never acquired—a fact which, under the circumstances that occurred rather stamps me as a round peg for a square hole in connection with my supposed part in the subsequent events. Anyway, here I was with the prospects of a real good time before me, ready to enjoy myself with a jolly good fellow for a host, who, without any hint from me to do so, had removed all obstacles which might have prevented my complete enjoyment of the visit.

I Became Mr. Scott.

I gladly became Mr. Scott for the time. I felt relieved; our conversation turned once more to pleasant subjects. On we tumbled through the country as happy as we could be, little dreaming of what was going to happen within the next forty-eight hours and what that very relief I then felt would cost me.

And now let me, before I leave this part of the story, ask you, my readers, to put from your minds all that happened subsequently to that night, and take a fair, unbiased view of the situation under which I adopted the name of Scott, and say if, under the circumstances, it was in any way suspicious of an evil intention.

Mr. Monson had in a moment of good fellowship invited me to stay with him as his guest, and he suddenly realized that it would not be pleasant to have it known his visitor was Ted Davis the bookmaker, for obvious reasons. Ted Davis the engineer would not do, for the name Ted Davis was known to his wife; and therefore the suggestion that I should adopt the name of Scott was not an evil one, but I believe it is the custom of many people, from Royalty down to humble individuals, to pass incognito when constituted pleasure renders it necessary that their identity should not be discovered for various reasons, and therefore I say I did nothing wrong, and nothing even that should tell against me, when I fell in with the above suggestion.

In Ardlamont House. 

Having arrived at Ardlamont House and been introduced to Mrs. Monson, who received me most cordially, we proceeded to the dining-room, where a very welcome and nice dinner awaited us. The party at dinner consisted of Mr. Monson and his wife, the governess (Miss Heron), and myself. Mr. Hambrough did not appear at dinner, and though I understood he was staying in the house, I had at this time never seen him, and did not know but what he was a guest similar to myself, and it never crossed my mind that he was the real owner and Monson was his tutor. I do not suggest that Mr. Monson deceived me as to this, or that it was willfully mislead; I suppose, having been introduced to him as a swell with lots of money, I subsequently ascertained that Mr. Hambrough was away fishing that evening, and did not return until very late at night—past midnight.

All went very pleasantly at dinner. Mrs. Monson was a charming hostess, and made me feel quite at home; and informed me amongst other things she had engaged a new cook for the shooting season for the benefit of the gentlemen who would be at Ardlamont.

After dinner Mr. Monson and I adjourned to the smoking room, and there again I was struck by the completeness of things and the very comfortable way in which I had lived. The dinner had been excellent, and the whisky was very fine, I remember, tempting me to take several glasses, and once more to thank my good fortune in having encountered my new friend.

On being shown to my bedroom I fancied it was a little cold, and therefore asked to have a good fire made to warm it, as I was, after my journey, feeling a little bit chilly, and feared an attack of asthma (to which complaint I am very subject) if I caught cold."

"I ought to mention, as it might be said why not Ted Sweeney, that Mr. Monson had no idea by which I have always been known on the turf, and therefore it would have been as strange for him to call me Sweeney as Scott, and I preferred the latter name myself when he suggested it; and I believe it is the custom of many people, from Royalty down to humble individuals, to pass incognito when constituted pleasure renders it necessary that their identity should not be discovered for various reasons, and therefore it is necessary that their identity renders it necessary that their identity should not be discovered for various reasons, and therefore I say I did nothing wrong, and nothing even that should tell against me, when I fell in with the above suggestion.
