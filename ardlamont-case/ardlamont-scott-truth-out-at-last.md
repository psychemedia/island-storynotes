THE TRUTH OUT AT LAST. BY SCOTT (the Missing Man).

How and Why I went to Ardlamont, the Story of the Boat Incident, the Death of Mr. Hambrough, and my subsequent Disappearance and Adventures when charged with Murder. By EDWARD SWEENEY (the Missing Man himself).

PREFACE.

IN publishing this, the true account of the Great Ardlamont Mystery which for a period of four months occupied the attention of almost every man, woman, and child in the United Kingdom, I make but one apology-namely, to the British public for the delay in putting before them the facts within my own knowledge of that most unhappy and unfortunate occurrence which should (had not the Scotch law authorities by their action in charging me with an atrocious crime, without one particle of evidence to justify them in doing so) have been published long since.

I make no claim to literary powers, but will do my best to show by my statement how by one mistake (I mean my harmless adoption of a name other than that by which I was commonly known on the turf for reasons which I will explain) I woke up to find myself involved in a mystery, charged with murder, hunted like a dog with a price upon my head, declared an outlaw, and doomed to suffer more than by my poor ability I can ever hope to make my readers appreciate. Now for my story.  
*London, April, 1894.* EDWARD SWEENEY.

CHAPTER 1.

*My acquaintance with Mr. Monson—I am invited to Scotland—Why 1 took the name of Scott—I arrive at Ardlamont on August 8, 1893.*

Those of my readers who arc acquainted with the peculiarly free and easy manners of gentlemen who profess a passion for horse-racing, and the ever-ready and broadcast way in which they dispense their hospitality to those whose acquaintance they make while following the pastime of racing, will understand that there is nothing strange, or in fact peculiar, in an invitation being given by a gentleman of position and means to a bookmaker to visit him at his sporting residence and enjoy with him a few days' holiday and recreation; and such was the nature of the pressing and kindly invitation received by me, Edward Davis, the bookmaker, from Mr. Alfred Monson, my client and patron, in the summer of 1833.

My acquaintance with Mr. Monson was of no great standing, having commenced some time about the month of May in that year, when he was introduced to me quite casually as a young swell with plenty of money and a great liking for horse-racing and betting, and therefore a most desirable gentleman for me to cultivate and do business with, and, to be perfectly frank, as I shall endeavour to be throughout my story, one from whom I desired and hoped to benefit considerably, and I must say that those few transactions on the turf which I have had with him have been to my own, and, I trust, our mutual satisfaction.

As I have said, it was in or about the month of May when I first met Mr. Monson, and between that time and August I saw him, perhaps, half a dozen times.

At the latter end of July I was in London, and accidentally met my racing friend, with whom I had some conversation on the usual topic, and it was at this meeting he informed me with evident pride and pleasure that he was about to enter into possession of what I understood to be his new sporting estate in Scotland.

Here let me at once state that at this time I did not know of the existence of Mr. Hambrough, and had never seen or heard of that young gentleman. I mention this to correct an error which is prevalent, to the effect that Hambrough was known to me; but such is not the case. Mr. Monson was my client and patron, and was, I thought what is termed a "swell," for as such he passed and acted.

At that meeting in London, some time during the latter part of July, Mr. Monson invited me to come to visit him at Ardlamont, and his invitation and the promised welcome were so kindly insisted upon that it was out of the question to refuse.

I accepted the offer, and it was arranged that I should set out for Scotland about the 7th or 8th of August, when Mr. Monson hoped to be in Glasgow, where we could meet and journey on to Ardlamont together.

THE JOURNEY TO ARDLAMONT

True to my promise and according to arrangement, I arrived in Scotland on the 7th August, and left Greenock with my host on the steamer which sailed from Greenock on August 8 about four o'clock in the afternoon, and, as if indicative of the trouble which was to follow that ill-omened journey, I remembered how intensely disagreeable was the terrible amount of soot and dirt which constantly fell upom me from the smoking funnels.

On board the steamer I was introduced by Mr. Monson, who, if my recollection serves me, did not give my right name, to a gentleman of the name of Donald, at whose invitation I went below to taste the Scotch whisky so strongly recommended  by him as an antidote for the soot and smoke from which we were all suffering.

While sampling Mr. Donald's prescription the steamer came alongside a pier, which I understood was our destination; so tumbling up on deck I sought out and collected my luggage, and thinking my host had gone ashore ahead of me, left the steamer by the gangway. But on my arrival on the pier I could not see Mr. Monson, and then I learned on inquiry that that I had made a mistake in getting off at Tighnaibruaich, instead of waiting until the steamer arrived at the next pier, the proper one for Kames, our destination. On realizing my mistake, or, more properly speaking, the error of Mr. Monson, in saying to me "Here we are," before he had assured himself of the name of the pier the steamer was alongside, and upon ascertaining the distance between Tighnaibruaich and Kames to be only about one mile, I immediately hired a trap to drive me to the latter; and whilst being so driven by the lad McPhee, the boots of the Tighnaibruaich Hotel, we met Mr. Monson, coming to look for me in his dogcart, which had evidently been waiting to meet him on the arrival of the steamer at Kames.

Mr. Monson was pleasant as usual over my mistake, and directed his coachman to put my luggage in the dogcart. I took my seat by his side, and off we drove to Ardlamont.

During the drive from the steamer to the house Mr. Monson mentioned the difficulty he felt in introducing me as Mr. Davis, the bookmaker, to his wife and any other ladies or guests who might come to Ardlamont, apologizing at the same time for having called me out of my name to Mr. Donald, and the occurrence was, as near as I can recollect, discussed in such a way as this:—

Mr. Monson: Look here, old fellow, it will never do for me to introduce you to my wife as Ted Davis the bookmaker, so you mustn't mind if I say you are something else, for I feel sure she would make a fuss about it. Not that she herself would care; but you know some people are funny about the turf, and think any one connected with it must be a wrong 'un.

I replied: I quite understand what you mean, and you may say whatever you like, so long as I know what to say myself.

Mr Monson: Well I thought you wouldn't mind; but my wife would know at once if she heard the name Ted Davis who you were, so you must not let her know.

"CALL ME JUGGINS."

I replied: It don't matter a jot to me what you call me, so long as you don't make a fool of me. You can call me Juggins or Muggins if you like, but it is no use my trying to be a toff, you know, and it's no use my saying I am a sport, for though I know as much about racing as most men that's about  all I know of sport. Can't you say I've come up on business and you have asked me to stay?"

Mr. Monson: I know, old chap. I will introduce you as the engineer come to look at the engines of the yacht for me, and that will be all right if you don't mind.

I replied: Do as you like, but if they get me on about the engineering you mustn't blame me if I give you away.

Mr. Monson: Oh, that'll be all right, old chap; we won't talk any shop, so let's remember you are, say, Mr. Edward Scott, the engineer, about the engines of the yacht, the *Alert*, which I am just going to have fitted.

After this conversation I must confess I did feel a little relieved, for I myself felt a little bit out of place going up to Scotland for the 12th August, presumably for the shooting, without any gun or anything of the sort, and I had more than once thought over my position if I should be asked to join in any shooting party, for it is a fact that I am absolutely ignorant of the art of shooting, never having possessed a gun or shot one off in my life, and at the same time I will confess that I am no athlete, and can neither shoot, fish, row, nor swim—four very useful and general accomplishments which I have never acquired—a fact which, under the circumstances that occurred rather stamps me as a round peg for a square hole in connection with my supposed part in the subsequent events. Anyway, here I was with the prospects of a real good time before me, ready to enjoy myself with a jolly good fellow for a host, who, without any hint from me to do so, had removed all obstacles which might have prevented my complete enjoyment of the visit.

I BECAME MR. SCOTT.

I gladly became Mr. Scott for the time. I felt relieved; our conversation turned once more to pleasant subjects. On we trundled through the country as happy and jolly as we could be, little dreaming of what was going to happen within the next forty-eight hours, and what that very relief I then felt would cost me.

And now let me, before I leave this part of the story, ask you, my readers, to put from your minds all that happened subsequently to that night, and take a fair, unbiased view of the situation under which I adopted the name of Scott, and say if, under the circumstances, is in any way suspicious of an evil intention.

Mr. Monson had in a moment of good fellowship invited me to stay with him as his guest, and he suddenly realized that it would not be pleasant to have it known his visitor was Ted Davis the bookmaker, for obvious reasons. Ted Davis the engineer would not do, for the name Ted Davis was known to his wife; and therefore the suggestion that I should adopt the name of Ted Scott and pass as the engineer to account for my presence and my want of sporting equipment for the shooting.

I ought to mention, as it might be said why not Ted Sweeney, that Mr. Monson had no idea my real name  was not Davis, which is the name by which I have always been known on the turf, and therefore it would have been as strange for him to call me Sweeney as Scott, and I preferred the latter name myself when he suggested it; and I believe it is the custom of many people, from Royalty down to humbler individuals, to pass incognito when courted pleasure renders it necessary that their identity should not be discovered for various reasons, and therefore I say I did nothing wrong, and nothing even that should tell against me, when I fell in with the above suggestion.

IN ARDLAMONT HOUSE.

Having arrived at Ardlamont House and been introduced to Mrs. Monson, who received me most cordially, we proceeded to the dining-room, where a very welcome and nice dinner awaited us. The party at dinner consisted of Mr. Monson and his wife, the governess (Miss Heron), and myself. Mr. Hambrough did not appear at dinner, and though I understood he was staying in the house, I had at this time never seen him, and did not know but what he was a guest similar to myself, and it never crossed my mind that he was the real owner and Monson was his tutor. I do not suggest that Mr. Monson deceived me as to this, or that I was wilfully misled; but I suppose, having been introduced to him as a swell with lots of money, I assumed all I saw and envied was part of his good fortune. I subsequently ascertained that Mr. Hambrough was away fishing that evening, and did not return until very late at night—past midnight.

All went very pleasantly at dinner. Mrs. Monson was a charming hostess, and made me feel quite at home; and informed me amongst other things she hoped I could stay for the shooting, and as an inducement stated she had engaged a new cook for the shooting season for the benefit of the gentlemen who would be at Ardlamont.

After dinner Mr. Monson and I adjourned to the smoking room, and there again I was struck by the completeness of things and the very comfortable way in which he lived. The dinner had been excellent, and the whisky was very fine, I remember, tempting me to take several glasses, and once more to thank my good fortune in having encountered my new friend.

On being shown to my bedroom I fancied it was a little cold, and therefore I asked to have a good fire made to warm it, as I was, after my journey, feeling a little bit chilly, and feared an attack of asthma (to which complaint I am very subject) if I caught cold.

My room having been beautifully warmed, after a parting glass and cigar with Mr. Monson, I retired to rest on the night of the 8th of August, 1893, without a thought of anything but my own good luck in being a visitor at Ardlamont House, the guest of such a delightful host and hostess as Mr. and Mrs. Monson.

THE TRUTH OUT AT LAST.

BY SCOTT (THE MISSING MAN).

HOW AND WHY I WENT TO ARDLAMONT, THE STORY OF THE BOAT INCIDENT, THE DEATH OF MR. HAMBROUGH, AND MY SUBSEQUENT DISAPPEARANCE AND ADVENTURES WHEN CHARGED WITH MURDER. BY EDWARD SWEENEY (THE MISSING MAN HIMSELF).

CHAPTER II.

*The Morning of the 9th August, 1893 — My Introduction to Mr. Cecil  Hambrough — The Story of the Boat Incident on the Night of the 9th August, 1893.*

The stirring sounds of a gong awoke me on the morning of August 9, and I hastened to the breakfast-room, where I found already assembled Mr. and Mrs. Monson and the governess with their three little children, two little girls and a little boy, most intelligent and pretty youngsters. Besides the above-mentioned, there was also at the table a tall, fair young gentleman, to whom Mr. Monson introduced me as "Mr. Scott—Mr. Hambrough." This was Mr. Cecil Hambrough, whom I took to be a friend or guest.

I took a seat opposite to Mr. Hambrough, and from the conversation at the breakfast-table nothing passed to intimate to me that the position of the parties assembled was other than I had fancied.

I was struck with the appearance of Mr. Hambrough, who certainly was an exceptionally nice young fellow, bright but unassuming, and seemingly perfectly happy and contented with his lot in life.

The conversation was chiefly about the prospects of shooting and fishing, and reference was made to the late hour at which Mr. Hambrough had returned the previous night from his sport. He seemed to be an enthusiastic fisherman, and only laughed at the allusions to late hours and wet clothes, &c.; and while admiring the manly, sportsmanslike nature of this fine young fellow, I could not help feeling that his idea of enjoyment and my own were somewhat different, at the same time making a mental note for myself that mucking about with sopping wet nets, up to one's knees in water, till past midnight would not suit my book, or be conducive to my good health.

I made an allusion to my objections and remember trying to cover any suspicion of fear by the usual remark suggesting how delighted I should be if the confounded asthma did not prevent my going in for such fun, at which Mr. Hambrough laughed in his quiet gentlemanly way.

I say I was struck by this fine young fellow, and instinctively liked him, and although I am a bookmaker, and frankly confess that as such I should not have hesitated to have done a good stroke of business with him, perhaps to my own advantage and his loss, my blood fairly boils when I remember how I read in the daily papers of the suggestion of the Solicitor-General for Scotland that I at this time was there for the express purpose of joining in a conspiracy to take the young man's life. Great God! what sort of a desperate villain have I been reckoned to be! I am introduced to as fine a young gentleman as I ever saw, in the morning, with whom I have had no quarrel, who owes me nought, and from whom I expect nothing, but that very night I for some unexplained reason (other than, I suppose, the suggestion that I should share in some money which others might receive at his death) deliberately connive at, and assist in a cold-blooded and diabolical attempt to drown him while I stand on the shore and hear his cries. But that is not all. The attempt to take his life that night having failed, or rather one of the murderers having repented of the act (for such must have been Mr. Monson's reason for bringing his friend out of the water, where it is suggested he deliberately put him), I again shake him by the hand, and wait until the next morning, when I assist to take him out to meet his doom and be shot like at dog before my own eyes.

That was the preposterous story of the prosecution, awl that was the story which all that talent and money could do sought to induce the jury to believe, but which the judge refused to allow, and the jury refused to swallow. 1 must not, however, digress from my story. I am not on my defence, and I hope my readers will excuse me for the little outburst above.

TO DO


PREPARING THE BOAT.

After breakfast Mr. Monson intimated his intention of going for a bathe, and asked me to accompany him, which I did, hait reastved to bathe. As I have already said, I sailter naion frli a ithla'~, afdt-;il cint swiml, bahing in the open sea is not ninelih of a luxury to tinc. Whilst walking, with Mr. Monson we met the agent, who I afterwards, learnt was Mr. St~-phle, and he and the former had some conversation about the boat, wil it was suggested was not big enough for the fishing ~11ir. Ilianiiiri tih airiidiie.( ill, and therefore it was arranged to go round aid g'1t tiolier fare-er i We consequently walked round to the place where the loagr et vi and got into it, to bring it round to the same spot where the other one was lying on the beach, and Mr. Monson asked tinc to take ani dr ani !tellp him pull her round. I did take aiil oar, and succeeded in catching fra crabs, and in generally making an exhibition of myself and doing as ?? as I could to capsize her in the swell from the paddle steamers. We did, however, eventually manage to get the boat round to the spot required, and Mr. Monson seemed relieved to be lshunit of his crew. TIhteaitt to carry down the nets and put them in the boat frti)r~-. 1ionitrag't)~. I1 There was a tremendous lot of net, I thought, and they were all piled into the smaller boat, according to Mr. Hambrough's \visi. Ilii tatt, the 1 oat ?? dI all net1 and I didn't quite see where the fishermen were going to sit or pull. At dinner in the evening the proposed fishing expedition that ?? was discussed. Mr. Hambrough pressed me to collie with them, and seemed to enjoy in his quiet way my various excuses for not sti ing ilii fune in the same light as himself; but I promised to come down and give them a shove off. We had a very nice and pleasant dinner, and it must have been half-past nine or ten o'clock when we rose from the table and xalkttl down to the boats, which were some five hundred yards or so from the li onus. On arrival at the boats Mr. Hambrough and Mr. Monson both again rirhd to persuade me to go along with them, but I firmly stuck to my resolve not to go, making all sorts of excuses-that I had no fishing cit liths, and was feeling seedy, &c., anything; but the real train was being, out ain1ollit a lot of soaking wet nets, Iin a small open boat, on a pitch (etin night, fishing off the coast of Scotland, was not in my Into0.

Time: ACCIDENT.

I gave them a shove-off, and away they went to nirtloy ttte'a l ef-~, jolly as could be, laughing at mny timidity, Leaving me, standing on the beach, enjoying myself in my way, smoking a cigar. The night was pitch dark, and they were soon lo- t to mny view its they rowed seawards but they could not have cone inuch incre thita a few. hundred yards or so when I heard a shout ti-om the seca to the ri glit of where the boat left thle beach. I could see nothing, bttt liolluad back, "Hullo!" Now let me make no mistake-or rather do not my reaithrs inisimnhcr- stand me the shout I heard was not a cry for help, or anything like it, bat was a shoot of surprise, such as a manl would utter if the unexpected thing had happened. The next thing I saw-and it all took place in a very few' mliInLt-~S xv-as Mr. Monson come rtniniiig tip, wet through, to the other boat,v.ie I was standing. I said What's up?" and he replied, as far as I can remember, That damned boat's capsized, and shot ?? ?? dl thellisti into the water! I ere give us a hand, and htelp) shove eil the boat I moat go and fetch him in." He got hold of the boat, and looked to see if the plug was in the bottom, but it was so dark he could not find it, and said, to me, "You run up to the house, like a good chap, and get a fight??? of some sort, and look slippery about it anything will do, but I uanlt ?? limiyation, it's so dark." All this took place in less time than it takes to write, and during the whole of the time Mr. Hambrough, kept calling out to Monson to let him know his whereabouts. Mr. Hambrough did not give one cry for help, or anything like it, but, on the contrary, seemed to be perfectly happy wherever he was; which I could not have been very many yards away by the sound of his voice, Mr. Monson was in a hurry to get the boat off;, beat did not sound frightened or flustered, and they kept up the "Coo-_ ey' to one another, with an odd laugh in between. I believe I was the only one of the three who was at all frightened or alarmed, and I ran o-ill to the house as fast as I could go and got a light. The light I got was a great, big, heavy dining-room lamp the ground was rocky, tind I lictd to Slowebx with it, although I lost no time. When I arrived back, carrying the lamp, Mr. Monson had got the boat off, been out and fetched Mr. Hambrough, and they were both standing on the beach roaring with laughter at ine carrying, the ?? tiiit be iing,~ so scared. 'I DIDNxi Sti 'I If:- ?? As far as MrF. I la nihroughi amd Mr. Monson were ccut ceri ied, they ?? treated the whole thing as a capital joke and (lid 1iiti litg hut lak~e thul of me and the lamp, and I could tell you, my readers, I didn't see the joke. They kept me humbugging about for quite half an hour holding the lamp (and I tell you it weighed something after I had held it up for that time, for I couldn't set it down on the bench) till I had had about enough of it, and began to feel ever pleased with myself and mysh fisthimig excnin ?? they still seemed to ciiioy immensely, but which I thought un catlih After they had got the boats made fast--for they tiaed both of the olu 1 the beach -we walked up to the house, and they both had some hot whisky-and-water and I remember I was so thirsty running about with the lamp that I had a good ?? of beer. That is the story of the boat incident, of which so much has been made and said, and which h rscl tion tried to prove was an attempt to initi cr-. My readers will say, Why was I not at the trial to tell the jury this? but do not forget I never had tht chance give itile. 1 a vo ke otlre muorning, -CLEANING SILVER.-Alt difficulty in keeping silver, clecirti-plate, &c., ,intarnished and with a brilliant volish. may be obviates by uiling GODDAMYir NoN-.INIEXCCRIAL PLAYE POWDER. bold everywhere in boxes, Ii., 2s. 6d., and 4s. 6d. Six Gold Medals awvaxted I to find my self charged with murder, and had I gone to Scotland I should have beeu popped straight into a ccil, and without a chance to speak; have been put in the dock, where my mouth would have been closed, and where I could not speak of what I saw and knew, but should have had to stand and listen to other people who knew nothing whatever about the occurrence deliberately giving all sorts of versions and opinions of what they knew nothing about, with thei manly and charitable intention of ?? IC of murder innocent or not, no matter; for such appears to nic to be the privilege of a Solicitor-General in Scotland when conducting a prosecution for the Crown. I am sincerely sorry if by my absence Mr. Monson so fared, but I say I was well advised that I could do him no good by standing by his side. I had accepted one invitation to bonny Scotland, and I wasn't in a hurry to accept a second, although the Procurator-Fiscal kindly ?? to p~la ?? ?? utp and promised me a hearty welcome, but gave my Ilien,;l 110 al) Irei1'X2 as to mny return ticket. lint to return to my story.

And so I retired to rest on the eventful night of the 9th of August, 1893.

CHAPTER III.

The llunrnh lo ?? 1kr 10/A A ugvs!. 1893.--- Tk slo)T of l/: Death qf fr. Cecil Hambrough I Jr! .1dlZniont. 1IT must have been soon after daybreak when I was roused out of bed on the morning of the 10th August to join Mr. Hambrough and Mr. Monson in the rabbit-shooting expedition which had been arranged - over night; and little did I relhis the treat, as, though I cannot say it was raining, there were evident signs of a beautiful Scotch mist. The air was cold and chilly, and the ground wet and slippery as wc started r off on the fatal journey. i ! ?? I must admit I took no pleasure in thc sport upon which the others were so keen. We had not proceeded very far when bang- 2 bang went Mr. Monson's gun, and I saw the Iir-t rabbit shot-the s first I had seen killed in my litc. - By the way the two shots were fired I could not help thinking, that, had the rabbit bolted my way, it was not long odds I did not get - some of the clia rge in my legs; and having heard that it is ?? the 2 I most uncommon thing in the world for careless and hasty young sportsmen to turn round and blaze away at wherever the rabbit runs; I thought I would act as carrier, and offered to carry the game, at a respectful distance from the shooters; but I was told to let the rabbit lie where it was, and we could pick it up on the way home. The rabbit was not picked up, but nevertheless I let the guns go ahead, and when they were well in advance I followed them both. Bang, bang, bang, again, and again, and again, went the guns, and over rolled the rabbits, till I found myself walking along with three of them to carry. When we came to the wood Mr. Monson and Mr. Hambrough separated, the former going to the left and the latter to the right, whilst I grew more careful than ever, because I could not see them distinctly through the wood and fell further in the rear out of harm's way. Wve had not proceeded far when I heard a single shot fired, and I called out something to the effect, "What have you got" I received no answer, and concluded it was a miss, so I had nothing to pick up this time. Proceeding along, I came to the end of the wood, and there I saw Mr. Monson ahead of me, going towards the direction of the shot, and as we left the edge of the wood we bore away to the right, each from different angles, Mr. Monson being a little in advance of me. Ile was carrying his gun on his shoulder.

THE DEATH.

Mr. Hambrough was not in sight, although he should if he had kept on in his position in the wood have been out first, but I saw Mr. Monson ";as 4gop in the open, and as he was evidently not going to shoot I quickened my pace and was soon alongside of him. We turned in the direction Mr. Hambrough should be walking in, and had not gone more than fifteen to twenty yards when-what did I see? That which I call never forget. The apparently lifeless body of Cecil Hambrough. Mr. Monson was by his side immediately, and lifted up his head to ascertain if the poor fellow was dead, or showed any signs of life. Ile called him by his name, Cecil, but the lips and eyes made no response. I am not an old soldier or a doctor, and the sight of this fine young gentleman lying dead before me almost took away my scared senses. I am told I helped to lift him up, and, if I was asked to, I have no doubt I assisted to the best of my ability; but if my life was staked upon my answer I could not tell with any minuteness what did or did not happen, or what was or was not said, during the few seconds wve were standing by the lifeless body of Cecil Hambrough-a few hours ago the bright, handsome fellow who made ?? of mlly timidity. Run to the house and get assistance was tile only thing to do, and we lost no time in doing it. Mr. Hambrough's body was picked up and carried to the house, and the doctor sent for by messenger on horseback. On the arrival of Dr. MacMillan from Tighnabruiach about eleven o'clock in the morning, he, after a careful examination of the body, pronounced that poor Mr. Hambrough was dead, and be then commenced to make some inquiries, and to ask for information as to how the accident had occurred. Dr. MacMillan questioned me as to what I knew of it, and I told him exactly what I have repeated in this story. Dr. MacMillan questioned every one he thought proper about the occurrence, and shortly after mid-day it was an undoubted, admitted fact, that Mr. Hambrough had met his death by an accidentally self-inflicted wound caused by the going off of his own gun.

WHY I LEFT ARDLAMONT.

I naturally expected there would have to be an inquest, and with this very object in my mind I asked Dr. MacMillan whether it would be necessary for me to remain, and was greatly relieved when lie assured me that it would not be at all necessary, as his certificate of the accident was quite sufficient, and there would be iio inquest. 1 admit I was more than pleased to hear this, as I had already seen that if I had to give evidence at the inquest I should have to explain that my real name was not Scott, and this I did not relish, not from any feeling of wrongdoing, but from a not unnatural repugnance to being shown up before every one as Ted Davis, the bookmaker, and not Edward Scott the engineer; but I say, and trust my readers will believe me when I say, that had I been told it would be well for me to stop I should have done so, and given my evidence without fear. As it was, however, my visit was at an end; poor Mr. Hambrough was lying dead in his house, and by this time I had learnt his true position. I knew, of course, his family should arrive shortly. What was I to do? I was not a personal friend of his, neither was I an old friend of Mir. Monson. Was it right and proper that I should intrude myself upon the family at such a time, or ought I with as little delay as possible to withdraw and make room for those who had a better right to occupy my room in the house of mourning? I think my readers will agree with me that, immediately I ascertained I was not wanted and could do no good, I did the right thing in taking my leave immediately, and it would have been unseemly for me to have acted otherwise. 1 therefore spoke to Mr. Monson, and said I should go on to Glasgow by the afternoon, boat, and he agreed with me that it was perhaps best under the circumstances that 1 should do so. Now as I recall the eve of my departure from Ardlamont I cannot refrain from saying a word for Mr. Monson.

A WORD FOR MR. MONSON.

I, and I alone, was the only person who could give evidence in his favour if there was any suspicion of foul play; and yet lie without a care for himself let me leave the place, and it is positively true that he did not know at what address to find me. Is it probable that a person who had a guilty knowledge would thus put his salvation from him in that free and easy manner? for the man who could have conceived the crime imputed to him would have been a most astute villain, and would most assuredly either have detained me there for his false witness, had I been a co-conspirator, or a true witness had I been his dupe. But just think, again, my readers, false or true, which ever way he should have planned it, this supposed clever, scheming scoundrel had deliberately, by his own initiative, ruined the value of his own and only witness by bringing hiu upon the scene under a false name and occupation, which must most inevitably have come to light had such services been required of me as it has been suggested were within his contemplation at the time lie arranged his plot. Why, then, did I leave Ardlamont? Because neither Mr. Monson nor myself had anything to fear; because I had been told by Dr. MacMillan I should not be wanted; because it vas the most respectful and natural thing to do under the lamentable circumstances, not to intrude myself upon mly host and hostess in their awful trouble. Therefore, quietly and openly in the afternoon of August 10, 1893, 'without concealment or undue haste, I took the boat and returned the way I had come, entering into conversation with a police officer at Tighnabruaich pier, with whom 1 discussed the accident, and to whom I gave the name of my hotel at Glasgow, where I could be found if wanted. Why did I not give my permanent address? Because I was not asked, and because I did not like to give cause for chatter to every busybody by revealing the truth I was so foolishly hiding-namely, my change of name and occupation; and because I did not think it was the right and proper timing to do to Mr. and Mrs. Monson after their kindness and hospitality to me.

THE TRUTH OUT AT LAST. BY SCOTT (THE MISSING MAN). HOW AND WHY I WENT TO ARDLAMONT, THE STORY OF THE BOAT INCIDENT. THE DEATH OF MR. HAMBROUGH, AND MY SUBSEQUENT DISAPPEARANCE AND ADVENTURES WHEN CHARGED WITH MURDER. BY EDWARD SWEENEY (THE MISSING MAN HIMSELF).

CHAPTER IV.

I am charged ?? murdering Mr. Cecil Hambrough-A warrant for my arrest Why I did not ?? I evaded the police-A reward of £200 is offered for Wy ?? adventures as apt outlaw. I ARRIVED in Glasgow on the evening of the 10th August, 1893, and after going to my hotel found myself thinking over the unhappy calamity which had so abruptly brought to an end my two days' holiday at Ardlamont, and, being of a very nervous temperament, feared if I remained idle with nothing to do or distract my thoughts the scene which I had witnessed would prey upon me: therefore I resolved without delay to get back to my business, and so efface as much as possible the unpleasant recollection; and with this object I lost no time in getting back to London, where I remained a few days. From the information I derived through reading the daily papers I learnt of the funeral of Cecil Hambrough, who was buried in the Isle of Wight on the 17th of August, and thus seven days had come and gone since the day of the accident and my having left Ardlamont. Moreover, the funeral of Mr. Hambrough had proved the correct- ness of the statement to me of Dr. MacMillan, that there would be no inquest and that he was perfectly satisfied; and with the exception of a few thoughts of the untimely death of so fine a young fellow, and the narrow squeak I had had of being put into a very unpleasant position and experiencing a disagreeable half-hour ins explaining to the coroner why I was Scott the engineer, the facts or the case were fading from my memory, when the rumour came out that Mr. Monson had some pecuniary interest in the policies of 

insurance upon the life of Mr. Hambrough, which was going to be I inquired into. f Here, ncw, lct me at once admit I made my awful mistake. WVhy did I not at once put myself in communication with Mr. Monson on the subject? Why? Because I knew nothing of Mr. Monson's affairs with, Mr. Hambrough, and nothing of any of the affairs of Mr. Hambrough; and again, ItogtIws well out of the business and had better keep olit, as I could do him no good and might do myself somei lhtrfn. I therefore resolved not to be drawn into any law suit that, as I thought, might ensue~, but now I know, like many others when too ate, how fatal a mistake I made in shunning an unpleasant duty. But wliat was this fresh rumour I-Mr. Monson going to be charged with the murder of Cecil Hambrough Impossible as it seemed to me the papers nevertheless reported SO. 1\tVI1 I KF PT iVcF Now, my reader, you will say, Why did I not at once go and tell all I knew? and my answer is, firstly, Because I knew the absolute absurdity of the suge,esoauddd not believe it could possibly be persisted in; and, secondly, because my moral courage failed me. And I will further answer the question by putting this to every one who reads this little story: Why does the schoolboy, when caught by his master tic in'; ?? c he ought not to do, however trivial, invariably to ci" qCry, are you doing, sir" say "Nothing, sir;"? Wnr \liao' e you, tny rcadici-, \viI-,I a tradesman has called to see you about some little account ,vII \v\i CC ?? able to pay, told the servant to say you were not in, when it would be much more simple and truthful to see the dun and tell him you wer", !cry 0 could not pay the account. Because, like you, I had not the inor.l c to do the right thing at the right moment, and preencrrc, if possible, to defer the evil day, in the hope that the incident would lod over without exposing me to open celtstilre and thtts I look the firt-F I also step. The motive given by the Fapet's fot' the sippowd intir1ctcr by Nonsol was the large sum of money it was ?? "tcd hie would t (c -ie by Hambrough's death; but of this I knew nothing ,Id could throw no light upon it; and as I read the accounts of ??

It took \'er little time to ?? the change, although I was quaking with fright and full of doubts as to whether my get-up would deceive a baby. I left the house, 011(1 passed out into the wide world to hide, a fugitive from the mighty armn of the law-to hide, God knew how or where. I had not proceeded far from the house when I met and passed an acquaintance wvho failed to recognize me, and thus reassured I hurried on. Where should I go?" What should I do? What could I do? I had a vague idea of going somnewhere, anywhere, by train. I knew I must put as great a distance as possible between myself and my usual haunts, and without loss of time. I would make my way to the open Park; perhaps I should get some tangible idea as I walked. Walked, did I say? Slunk, I thei-mat; for never did a beaten hound slink and cringe away from an infuriated master as I did from all contact with my fellow creatures that day. I selected all quiet streets, and avoided, every human being I possibly could as I eventually made my way to the Great Northern terminus, where I found a train about to start for Bradford. I took a third-class ticket for that place, and entered a smoking carriage with some sailors, with whom I at once entered into conversation, with the view of making it appear to any onlookers that I was not alone. Good, honest Jack Tars as they passed the bottle round, and brfore the train started we had been into the refreshment bar and cemented our friendship, and I was one of their party, thus cdv~fing the suspicions of any one looking for an individual leaving London silently, and alone; and who knows but that on that very platform might have been the warrant for my arrest?

HUNTED.

Though I did my best to be one of the jovial party, and freely passed the bottle, I cannot describe my state of mind. Every passenger that looked into the carriage was my pursuer, the ticket inspector who asked t uts, "Where for, sir7" c'as a detective ill disguise to ascertain my destination. Every slam of a carriage door made inc start inwardly, and go hot a aind cold with fear, whilst the stoppages along tile route wxere moments of torture to me. Thank you, my jolly sailor-friends, for your company on r that day ! On arrival at Bradford I proceeded to walk from the station to the hotel. But my courage failed me; I could not enter the hotel; so, slipping back to the station, I took the next train to Hialifax, jumped into an empty third-class carriage with my bag, and between the stations changed my clothes.

Sothbimptor.ro*, Holbdrh, W. C. v .-I At Halifax I left the train, took the hotel 'bus to - Hotel, and took a room for the night. It was now past ten o'clock, and I had had nothing to eat all day, the morning paper having killed my appetite for breakfast, therefore I ordered some supper and went to bed-not to sleep: how could I? The next morning I deemed it wise to have my breakfast in the coffee-room, taking care to avoid the window and exposure of my face in every possible way. I gave my assumed name as Mr. White, and asked the landlord if a gentleman should call for me, to say I had gone on to Newcastle, and would meet him there. I then directed a label "Mr. White, passenger to Newcastle," let every one see it, and took the hotel 'bus to the station, where I booked a first-class ticket to Newcastle, and tipping the 'bus porter royally, he helped me into the railway carriage with my bag; and so if Mr. White was traced to Halifax, there was no doubt he had gone on by train to Newcastle; but between Halifax and the next station I once more changed iny clothes to the old ones, and at the little station of Ovenden left the train and walked back to Halifax, caretully destroying my ticket and paying the fare at the barrier, and thus I reached the place which I had undoubtedly left, and where I resided for a week in the humble apartments of Mrs. A., a most loquacious old lady, whose conversation was principally the latest newspaper details of the Ardlamont Mystery, and poor Mr. Hambrough, poor fellow! My attentive old landlady was firmly of opinion that Scott had done away with Mr. Hamborough, and would be ?? to justice and, she hoped, hanged. Dear old soul, if she had known to whom she was talking!

CHAPTER V.

aM wanderings ?? surrender to the "PALL MALL GAZETTE" and a: Strottand Yarrd. ia NOTWITHISTANDING the kindness of my landlady, I began to fear ler a- j regard for my comfort would lead her to mark my delicate state of health and asthmatical tendencies, which, of all the facts daily published in the press, seemed ?? to give a clue to my identity. of Go I must, but where to? There is no doubt I was badly wanted, and I feared the whole talent and resources of the police would eventually tell against the game I was forced to play with such odds against me. The only friend I had was the press. That most obliging and useful chronicler of the doings of the police kept me daily posted as to their movements and warned me where to go and where not to go. How was I to leave my landlady without creating suspicion? A happy idea struck me. Entering the telegraph office, I sent myself a wire to the effect that my mother was suddenly taken ill of and not expected to live, and, hurrying home, I arrived in time to receive the telegram announcing the tidings, which instantly put Mrs. - into a state of bustle, under cover of which I left, with all her sympathy and good wishes, in time to catch the morning train for Birmingham. The whistle gave a screech, the train made a slight movement forward and then suddenly came to a standstill, without again moving for several minutes. What could be the cause? Had te a telegram arrived to search the train ?? Such, wretched man that I was, were the thoughts that flashed through my brain. I had purchased a newspaper, and instinctively I turned to read the latest development of the search for the missing man. Then I thought the man next to me seemed surprised at my evident keen desire for 

this news, and I ceased to read it; where-uponl the man opposite undoubtedly noticed my suspicious conduct in hd,,ily turning tp pages from view. This takes time to write, and may seem to my readers absurd, but tlime were my ?? and experince, and already the cold Sweat was upon ic' cauisng" ill, to Shiver with the cold and conuinence to cough, so that my chest ached and my lhcadI bwarn with fear and dread lest I should be betrayed by fly Wi11Ci'll"~ The train sped on its way for two hours, when we drew up at some Junction, and to my horror I perceived a tremendeus crowd evidently of the racing fraternity on the platform; the door was opened, and in they rushed, n'~ot five a side, but tcnl oil huddled together. Of course, fool that I was, they were off to the races. In that carriage I declare there were three men I knew, and two of whom ?? to have ?? mie well. Did they know nic I kept illy handkerchief to my eye as if I had something in it, until the carriage was clnpt icd of its sporting-element, leaving me alone with a single individual, who, i oundlv abused the fraternitv x' 011 arrivi-:act m ni (Icstinat~ili I re ;alvcd not ??
