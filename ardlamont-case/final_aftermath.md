ARDLAMONT CASE RECALLED.

DEATH OF MAJOR HAMBROUGH.

The famous Ardlamont mystery is recalled by the death at Hove, at the age of fifty-nine, of Major Dudley Albert Hambrough, father of Mr. Cecil Hambrough, who lost his life by a gunshot wound in 1893.

Although the precise circumstances of the mystery may have been forgotten, the name of the case will long linger, says the *Evening News*, in the public memory.

Mr. Cecil Hambrough, a young man with expectations. was a lieutenant in a militia battalion, who was coached for his examination by Alfred John Monson, a member of a well-known family. Young Hambrough owed Monson money, and to secure this he insured his life for £20,000, the policies being assigned to Mrs. Monson in the summer of 1893. Shortly after thin Monson incited Mr. Hambrough to come to shoot on an estate that he had hired at Ardlamont, in Argyllshire.

At Ardlamont young Hambrough met with two misadventures, the second proving fatal. The first was on the night of August fifth, 1893, when Mr. Hambrough had a narrow escape from drowning. With Monson and a man who passed under the name of Scott, Mr. Hambrough went out in a boat, which let its occupants into the water, but all three got safely ashore. The next morning the three went out rabbit shooting, and Mr. Hambrough then lost his life by receiving a charge of shot in his head.

The man known as Scott did not remain to make an explanation, but Monson asserted that Mr. Hambrough must have shot himself, presumably by accident.

After a lapse of some days Monson was arrested, and tried on a charge of murder, but a ten days' trial at Edinburgh ended in the Scottish verdict of not proven.

The Crown suggested that either Monson or Scott had previously cut a hole in the boat, and that in the dark in Ardlamont Bay the boat was deliberately scuttled by the removal of a plug from the hole.

It was then alleged by the prosecution that this attempt to get rid of the young man being unsuccessful, either Monson or Scott on the following morning shot him in order to get the £20,000 for which he was insured.

The defence argued that there was no motive for the murder, it being as much or more to the advantage of Monson that Mr. Hambrough should live and come into his expectations, than that he should die. Monson, as a matter of fact, did not reap any advantage from the youth"s death, as the insurance policies had been improperly effected, and the societies did not pay the sums for which Hambrough was insured.

Steephill Castle, Isle of Wight. the former home of the Hambrough family, is now the residence of Mr. John Morgan Richards, father of the well-known novelist, the late John Oliver Hobbes.
