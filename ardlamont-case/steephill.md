Queen Adelaide.— It would be matter of great regret if her Majesty Queen Adelaide were to lose the advantage of the mild air of the Undercliff of the Isle of Wight during the next winter by any difficulty in obtaining a suitable residence. The only house on a splendid scale in that region is Steephill Castle; but if it be impracticable to obtain it for the Royal invalid, there are other mansions of inferior pretensions, but possessing the same recommendations of shelter and retirement, which might accommodate her Majesty and the small circle of friends she would probably take with her. The highest medical authorities have declared the climate of Bonchurch, and the southern coast, equal to that of Montpelier or Madeira, and we hope that no effort will spared to procure for Queen Adelaide a participation in those benefits which are obtainable by persons of inferior rank.*— Morning Paper.*
