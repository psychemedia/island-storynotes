COMPLEMENTARY BANQUET.—On Tuesday last, a public dinner celebrating the coming of age of Dudley Albert Hambrough, Esq., took place at the Marine Hotel, which was largely attended by the resident gentry, the principal tradesmen, and others taking an interest in a name so well known and so throughly respected as that borne by the young gemtleman, to do honour to whom they had met together. Messrs. Bush and Judd have the credit, we believe, of being the first in Ventnor to serve a public dinner *a la Ruses*, and they may be congratulated on the complete success of the expermiment, for although, of course, it involves a much larger staff of waiters, the additional comfort of the guests was fully appreciated. The handsome coffee-room was tastefully and appropriately decorated for the occasion, whilst the taste and elegance of the tables, which were adorned with a number of magnificent epergnes, vases of flowers, and a splendid dessert, produced a most pleasing effect, and called forth general expressions of delight. The bill of fare was such as might tempt a hermit to foreswear his vows, and, in fact, the whole of the arramgements were admirable. After the more solid business of the table had been despatched, the chairman (Dr. Leeson) proposed the health of Her Majesty the Queen, which was responded to loyally, and two verses of the National Anthem were sung; after which the health of the "Prince of Wales and the rest of the Royal Family" met with an equally hearty reception. "The army, navy, and volunteers" was replied to by Captain Norris, who, in the absense of General Sir John Cheape, briefly thanked the assembly for the army and militia, and Lieutenant Camplin for the Volunteers, who, in the course of his speech, made some touching allusions to the respect and affection in which the late Mr. Hambrough had been held by the Ventnor Volunteers. They (the Volunteers) had looked forward to seeing Mr. Dudley Hampbrough at their head, and they could not but grudge him to the army, but he wished the army to understand that they regarded it only in the light of a loss, and he hoped that in a few short years Mr. Hambrough would again be amongst them, taking the lead in every national and philanthropic movement. The toast of the evening was then proposed by the chairman. He hoped that Mr. Hampbrough would, when perhaps far distant, often recur with pleasure to the gatherings of that evening. He was quite sure that the rest of those present would not readily forget it. He could not look upon the beaming face of the young gentleman beside him just entered upon manhood's many duties without anticipating for him an honourable and brilliant career, although at the same time he could not but regret that for some time he would be absent from a locality in which he had already so many friends. The toast was drunk with hearty and prolonged cheering, the toastmaster (Mr. Gilbert, of Ryde), in energetically giving the beats, bringing down the glass of a chandelier with his baton, which narrowly missed that functionary's respectable head.—Mr. Hambrough, when at length he could make himself heard, thanked those present for the hearty way in which he had bean received, and the honour they had done him. His late father's memory had been touched on in a previous speech, and for the many kindly epithets which had been used in connection with it, he thanked them very much. He only hoped that he should live in such a manner as to cause his friends and neighbours to speak of him after he was gone with equal kindness and respect. After a few more remarks expressive of the pleasure be felt in meeting so goodly an assembly as the present, he sat down amidst renewed cheering.—In returning thanks for the "Town of Ventnor," Mr. T. Burt, as one of the oldest inhabitants, said he could well recollect the time when Ventnor was not. There was a plece called "Ventnor Farm," but that was all. Mr. Hambrough's grandfather, when he came into this neighbourhood, anticipated a quiet retreat from the turmoil of business and the cares of society. In purchasing the Steephill estate. he expected to be far removed from any town, or collection of houses; but no sooner was the Castle built than people began to build here and there, in what is now called Ventnor. and gradually the town grew. Now, when Mr. Hambrough thus found his expectations disappointed, did he leave the neighbourhood or otherwise show his vexation? No, he accepted his new position, and the duties which were attached to it, and he commenced by building St. Catherine's Church; and the present still growing and prosperous town is, to a great extent, the result of the fostering care and generosity thus bestowed upon its infancy. Mr. Dudley Hambrough, now present, and whose majority they had met to celebrate, now stands in the same position as that occupied by his grandfather thirty or forty years ago, and from what he (Mr. Burt) had heard, he had no doubt that he would occupy his important position in such a manner as to give satisfaction to his neighbours and do honour to himself.—The health of Mrs. Verner and the ladies of Steephill was then proposed by Mr. Martin, which being drank with honours, Dr. Leeson returned thanks in a few appropriate words. He then named "the clergy," which was responded to *seriatim* by the four clerical gentlemen present, Mr. Wills, by reason of the virtues of "Good old St. Catherine," taking the precedence. Mr. Peile referred to the great kindness he had individually experienced from the late Mr. Hambrough and his amiable family. It was, in fact, indirectly through him that be had taken up his residence in Ventnor. He liked meetings of the present character; it threw people together who would otherwise not have the opportunity of making one another's acquaintance. Clergymen could for a time drop their strict clerical character; for his part, he liked to associate occasionally as well as to teach, and he had made many friends at the dinner table. After a few more remarks complimentary to the gentlemen occupying the post of honour, he proposed the health of the worthy chairman, who had just taken a new lease of life, if he might so call it, and none who knew Mrs. Leeson could say that the doctor had acted otherwise than wisely.—In returning thanks Dr. Leeson thanked Mr. Peile for his ingenuity, and assured him of no better prescription, and sat down amidst cheers and laugher.—The committee and secretary being proposed by the chairman, who referred to the secretary's readiness to couple himself with any scheme which could in any way promote the welfare and happiness of his fellow townsmen.—Mr. Trueman rose and said the absence of the original secretary, Mr. G. M. Burt, was occasioned by the loss of a near and dear relative, and having in a few appropriate words referred to the prospects of the town, and the auspicious event they were celebrating, Mr. Wells, in the absence of Dr. Whitehead, named "the ladies," a toast which met with its accustomed warm reception. Mr. Wells liked to propose "the ladies," and he was sure everybody liked to drink their health. He hoped he should be forgiven if he expressed a hope that in the hearts of most of those present the ladies were indelibly engraven. During the evening attention had been called to the rapid growth which had been made by Ventnor. He thought it a pity that a more uniform plan had not been considered in the construction of the town. The natural features, which in the Undercliff are everywhere charming, had not been sufficiently preserved. That, however, was to be expected from the eleemosynary way in which the town had been built. Now a large portion of the Steephill estate was about to be thrown into the building market for the erection of first-class residential houses, and a plan worked upon which, when the new town was completed, would combine the proper position and classing of roads and houses with the elimination of all that was naturally beautiful (a voice: "The ladies"). He believed that this was a great prospect for Ventnor. He had noticed that the shops increased in undue proportion to the surrounding residences. Perhaps in the whole Undercliff there was no place to compare in natural beauty with Steephill. He who had seen the sun's noontide rays glistening upon the—(cries, "the ladies, the ladies"). Gentlemen, if you interrupt me so I shall lose the point. I was going to say—. The chairman: But when are we to get to "the ladies." Mr. Wells: As I see you are in a hurry, gentlemen, I will not detain you any longer than to propose in all respect "The health of the ladies." This was drunk "bumpers all," and the chairman, Mr. Hambrough, and several others left.—Mr. T. A. Raynes was then elected to the chair, and a vote of thanks passed to Messrs. Bush and Judd for the admirable manner in which they had carried out their arrangements. The meeting did not separate till a late hour, when all expreseed themselves delighted with the evening they had spent. —The gentlemen acting as the committee, and with whom the project of the dinner originated, are Mr. T. Burt, Mr. T. A. Hams, Mr. G. M. Burt, Mr. T. H. Urry, Mr. L. B. Trimen, Mr. F. Truernan, Mr. Moore, and Mr. Gibbs.

Serious Accident. — We are sorry to have to record that on Wednesday Mr. Dudley Hambrough, of Steephill Castle, met with a serious accident while playing at football in a field adjoining the Castle. It seems that Mr. Hambrough and another gentleman were kicking at the ball, when they came into collision, and Mr. Hambrough's leg was broken. Dr. Whitehead was at once sent for, and set the limb, and we hear the unfortunate gentleman is progressing favourably.

Honey, Bible Christian Minister, Mr. Stabb, of the Midnight Move- . ment, Mr. Cooper, of the Rescue Society, Mr. E. J. Up- ward, Mrs. Butler, and Miss Wolstenholme. The Rev. S. i Atkinson proposed Mr. Upward, one of the town coun- e cillors, to take the chair, and stated that while the body r of the hall was filled with women, Mrs. Butler wished on the platform to be supported by ministers and her other friends, because what she had to advance would not 1' offend the most delicate sensibility, and could with equal freedom be spoken to men as to women.-Mr. e Cooper seconded the proposition, which was carried a unanimously.-Mrs. Butler then delivered the ad. I dress of which we last Saturday gave a copious report. z The meeting was also addressed by the Rev. S.

VENTNOR. Agents-Messrs. KNIGHT & SON. CHARGE AGAINST A VENTNOR TRADESMAN.— At the Isle of Wight Petty Sessions, on Saturday last Thomas Reynolds. confectioner, of Ventnor, and George lightfoot, a youth, were charged with a breach of the Poaching Act, 1862.-Mr. H. B. Hooper defended.-P.C. Crouch deposed: On Thursday morning, at 5 o'clock, I was on duty at Steephill Castle. Saw the two defendants in a field. They afterwards went into a footpath, and Lightfoot began beat- ing the hedge. Reynolds was standing near with a gun. They saw me standing some distance off, and they began running. I got over the hedge and ran after them. Over. took Reynolds in Church-street. Ventnor, with a gun and a rabbit. Reynolds threw the rabbit down near his door, and it was warm when I picked it up. They were on Squire Hambrough's land when I firstsaw them.-Cross- examined by Mr. Hooper: I know Reynolds well. He is a confectioner at Ventnor. He bad on a light coat and hat. I might be 200 yards off when I saw them together. I don't know what became of Lightfoot-I lost sight of him. Where I saw Reynolds was in the direction from Ladv Pelham's. Defendants came along the cliff together, and for a portion of time I lost sight of both of them.- Mr. Hooper said he should be able to show the Bonch that Mr. Reynolds had no right to be brought before them. He was a respectable confectioner in the town of Ventnor, and he had the permission of the Hon. Evelyn Pelham, and also of Lady Pelham, to kill rabbits in their grounds. On the morning in question he went there alone with his gun, and succeeded in killing a rabbit. On the same morn- ing Lightfoot, who had been down to the shore to bathe, fell in with another man with a gun, and it was those two whom the policeman followed. They separated, and in the 3 course of his pursuit the policeman overtook Mr. Reynolds .comig from Lady Pelbam's, and as he bad a gun and a rabbit, the constable concluded that he was the same man .whom he had seen with Lightfoot. It was altogether a groundless charge against Mr. Reynolds, who as a leading tradesman of Vetnor, would not be likely to commit himself in this manner, and for the sake of a rabbit to offend his best customer.-P.C. Crouch was recalled by the chair. man, in reply to whom he said: Reynolds was running t when I came up with him. I am sure he is the same man I saw with Lightfoot. He was not two minutes out of my ?? Blake, called by Mr. Hooper, said he lived at Ventnor, and on Thursday morning, about half past four, he was going to Steephill Cove, where his fithter lived, when he met Mr. Reynolds just coming out of Mr. Pelham's property. He had a gun and rabbit, and was I alone. About 20 minutes afterwards he saw a young man whom bethought to be Lightfootjoin a man who had a gun. E That man was not Reynolds. Reynolds had on a brown high hat and a brown coat. The other man wore a Scotch cap and a light ?? said he saw no man with a Scth cap on. There was a man in black there, but wit- ness did not know who he ?? Chairman said there I was some doubt in the case, of which the Bench gave defendants the benefit, and the summons was dismissed.

VENTNOR. On Wednesday, the 4th instant, a telegraphic message reached Steephill Castle, announcing the death of Mr. John Hambrougb, and the next morning the sad news were confirmed bv the tolling of the parsing bell of St. Catherine's Church, Ventnor. It appears the deceased gentleman was seized, whilst taking an airing his carriage, with a spasmodic fit, to which he had been subject before and recovered, but in this case the attack proved fatal, and he expired on Wednesday morning, a short time after the attack, his only surviving son Oscar Hambrough, and Mrs. Hambrough being the only relatives present, as when first taken his illness was not considered sufficiently serious to warrant the summoning the remaining members of ths family. For a number of years Mr. Hambrough had suffered from weak health, which had brought on an affection of the eyes, and ultimately he had been totally blind. He left Ven nor about twelve years ago, and has resided since chiefly in London, whilst the late lamented Mr. Albert Hambrough occupied the Castle at Steephill. With regard to the deceased gentleman and his connection with Ventnor, it may be said that he found it a wilderness and left it cultivated garden; and if it is true, as a great political writer of last century said, that "he was the greatest benefactor of his species who made two blades of grass grow where only one grew before," and if houses and gardens may be substituted for grass, then John Hambrough can claim to be a benefactor, as when he came to Steephill some thirty years ago, where there was one house and garden there are now fifty. In short, he gave to the place great impetus by the purchasing of the house and grounds at Steephill of the then Earl of Dysart, replacing the house by the splendid building known as Steephill Castle, the grounds of which he caused to be laid out a style compatible therewith. He brought a most excellent taste to bear on all things; and in addition to the castle, large conservatories and orangeries were erected, and no expense was spared render the place everything that ease and affluence combined could desire, added to which the inside of the castle displays cultivated taste and refined judgment in the selection of the different costly and splendid articles of science and art, amongst which can be enumerated many rare and choice paintings by the old and modern masters, besides sculpture and antiquities; indeed almost every branch of science and art, the middle ages up to the comparatively modern times, may said to be represented. A fine collection of geological specimens, no doubt the best in the Island, has been added to the above by his son, the late Albert Hambrough. The hospitality of Steephill Castle during the residence of Mr. Hambrough, sen., was of the genial English kind; and it often resembled an hotel in that respect, from the number of the guests assembled. Respecting his connection with the town of Ventnor, he built and endowed St. Catherine's Church, and the parsonage house; and last, not least, he gave the land and built a school-house, now enlarged, to which many of the present generation owe their knowledge of the three It's. In truth it may be said that Mr. Hambrough, if not the actual founder of the place, certainly gave the first impetus towards its rise and present aspect. Thus it will be seen that this true specimen of the old English gentleman "has left his foot-prints on the sands of time," and has bequeathed an amount of good done in his day that generations to come will be benefitted; and fear, without any desire to flatter, that the gaps left in society by the deaths of John and Albert Hambrough will long remain open. His remains were brought to Ventnor, and the funeral took place on Wednesday last, and was quite plain and unostentatious. The hearse left Steephill Castle quarter-past 11, and arrived at St. Catherine's Church about 12 o'clock. There were only two mourning coaches followed, which contained Mr. Oscar and the Rev. Mr. Hambrough (the eldest son of Mr. Albert Hambrough); the Rev. J. X. Coleman, many years the incumbent of Ventnor, followed in the second coach; Dr. and Mr. John Martin also followed their carriage, and about 50 of the tradespeople and inhabitants of Ventnor on foot. The coffin was of lead, encased with polished oak with gilt mountings. The inscription stated the date death and that his age was 69. Besides the Rev. Mr. Heath, the officiating minister, there were present the Revs. Levingstone, Fielden, Sharp, and Piele. After the service, the coffin was lowered into the vault, where lies his mother and son. Requicscat in pace." Tows Commissioners c. thk Press.—The resolution passed at the ratepayers' meeting, calling upon the Commissioners to rescind their restrictions upon the Press, was forwarded to the Board at their meeting on Monday, and acknowledged as "received." As no motion was made the subject, or indeed any further notice taken of it, we conclude the resolution found its way to the waste-paper basket; and the only reporter who condescends to act under the restrictive resolution of 1850 is Mr. Commissioner Moor of the Ventnor Times, and who, as commissioner, formerly helped to vote other reporters out of the room. It appears that he is prepared to eat the proverbial peek of dirt for the sake of selling his paper; yet, notwithstanding that his reports have been stigmatised times out of nnmber as wilful misrepresentations and falsehoods by almost every member the Board, no sooner a proposition made to rescind the obnoxious resolution and admit the press free, than these men are content to be misrepresented rather than; have correct reports and fair criticism. Moreover, this precious specimen of a reporter has submitted times out number to all sorts cf indignities and insults from the leading members of the Board; thus realising the couplet: M Patient in all abuse,— lie found contempt and kicking have their use.**

VENTNOR. A Madman in Steephll Castle.— In the small hours ou Sunday morning Major and Mrs. Hambrough, of Steephill Castle, were disturbed by some one in the house shouting and holloaing, The servants, on searching the place, found a strange man in one of the corridors. He behaved in a most outrageous manner, and before he was secured by the police caused some amount of damage. He proved to be a man who had been a waiter, named George Chilvers, discharged from the Queen's Hotel because of his eccentric behaviour. He is believed to be out of his mind.

VENTNOR

EFFECTING AN ENTRANCE INTO STEEPHILL CASTLE.—About 4 o'clock on Saturday morning the inmates of the Castle were alarmed by the discovery of a person within its precincts, who was at first supposed to be a burglar, but who was afterwards ascertained to be a person out of his mind. His name is Chivers, and is one of several waiters who were engaged from London by Mr. Ribbands, at the Queen's Hotel, for the Easter season. The man in his frenzy had left the hotel about 3 a.m. for a walk, and gaining an entrance to the Castle in some unaccountable way, had penetrated to Major Hambrough's bedroom, in the door of which he knocked out three of the panels. After a struggle, with the assistance of Major Golding and the head gardener, Major Hambrough succeeded in capturing the intruder, and after considerable difficulty, with the assistance of the police, he was taken to the police station, where he continued very violent at intervals. After medical examination and other trials the unfortunate fellow has been proved to be insane, and Dr. Woodford having given a certificate to this effect on Tuesday, he has been removed to the asylum at Fareham. The man was an entire stranger to the locality.

ISLE OF WIGHT BANKRUPTCY COURT. Holden at Ryde on Wedneaday, before Hie Honour Judge Leonard. ... 

TO DO


. Alexander Houston, —of Ventnor, land agent and Clerk to the Ventnor Local Board.—This debtor also came for his discharge. The Official Receiver reported as follows:—The receiving order herein was made on the debtor's petition on the 23rd of May, 1888. An order was made on the 6th of June, 1888, adjudging the said Alexander Houston bankrupt. The first meeting of creditors was held on the 6th June. 1888, and no resolution being passed for appointment of trustee, the Official Receiver remained trustee. The public examination of the bankrupt was concluded on the 6th June, 1888. The bankrupt submitted statement of, and in relation to, his affiura on the sth June, 1888. The statement disclosed liabilities expected to against the estate for dividend amounting to £7s*. The statement also disclosed assets estimated by the bankrupt to realise £422, after deducting preferential claims alleged to amount to £64 lOa The assets consisted of household furniture valued at £7O, a life policy valued at £lllss. 2d., and a claim against the estate of Mr. D. A. Ham(trough estimated to produce £405. Nothing has yet bean realised from this claim. To —l* the Court acquainted with the circumstances of the bankruptcy, it is necessary to refer in this report to the failure of Ur. D. A. Hambrough. late of Steephill Castle, Ventnor, for whom the debtor acted for number of years in the capacity of land steward and confidential agent. Ur Hambrough, whose affairs had been considerably involved tor several years, filed a petition in this Court in December, 1886. At that ki. liabilities to the mortgagees of bis life estate amounted to about £40,000, and to onsacured creditors to between £6000 and £6000 ??? . There was also an annuity of £BOO charged upon the income the life estate to insurance company, and the furniture of Steephill Castle was assigned by MU of sale a few months prior to the failure. By arrangement with the holder of the biU of sale the unsettled furniture was given up to me the trustee, and out of the proceeds dividend of 4s. 3d. in the £ was paid to the creditors in November, 1887. At the time of Ur. Hambrough'a failure the income of the estate represented to be £4800. Steephill Castle, which then occupied by Mr. Hambnmch. was sold in September, 1887, and the income was improved by the investment of the purchase money. At the time of the failure one of the farms in Middlesex was in the hands of a tenant who owed him over £600 for arrears of rent. A bad debt of £lOOO was made in connection with this tenant. The farm soon after became vacant, and after being on hand for some time was let little over half the rent. Owing to the continued depression in agriculture and also in the brick trade, it has been found necessary to reduce nearly all the farm rents to keep them tenanted, and two brick fields, which at the time of the bankruptcy produced large rents and royalties, have been on band for some considerable time. This depression has so affected the income of estate that the mortgagees have commenced foreclosure action. Several attempts have been, and are still being, made to raise money either to pay off the present incumbrances open further charge of the estate with the view of settling the claims of the unsecured creditors. I not to report that It is probable that these attempts wiU be successful. The above-named debtor proved against Mr. Hambrongh'a estate in December. 1886, for £633, and in November, 1887, received dividend amounting to £135. The balance of this claim (£405) was returned by the debtor an asset in the statement of affairs filed on bis bankruptcy, and was practically the only asset which was available for the creditors. Having regard to the facts above referred to, it is very doubtful if anything will be realised from this claim, or if any dividend will paid to the creditors. The bankiupt does not appear have committed any misdemeanour under the Bankruptcy Act, 1883, or the Debtors Act, 1869. With reference to sub-section section 28 of the Bankruptcy Act, 1885, 1 have to report that the debtor not a trader. would appear from the debtor's knowledge of Mr, Hambrough's business that he was aware that gentleman's embarrassments for some time before his actual bankruptcy. The debtor was no doubt led to incur some of the debts in the statement of affairs his inability to obtain payment of his salary from the Hambrough estate. debtor is Clerk to the Ventnor Local Board, and represents the mortgagees of the Hambrough estate tn connection with the Isle of Wight rents.—The Judge postponed the discharge «inr ilie

THE AFFAIRS OF MAJOR DUDLEY A. HAMBROUGH, J.P.

The first meeting of the creditors of Major Dudley Albert Hambrough, of Steephill Castle, Ventnor, Isle of Wight, and Test Cottage, Houghton, Stockbridge, Hants, gentleman, was held at the Chamber of Commerce, No. 145, Cheapside, on Wednesday afternoon.

List B— The fully secured creditors whose aggregate debts amount to £39,750, are (1) The Eagle Insurance Company, Pall Mall. London, claim £37,000, arrears of interest, £250. This claim is in respect of money advanced on mortgage of the debtor's life estate during the past 15 years. The various mortgages were consolidated in June, 1875, in one mortgage for £37,000 at 6 per cent. interest, reducible to 5 per cent, if paid within 30 days of its becoming due. In connection with this and the other charges, the debtor's life is insured in various offices for sums amounting in the aggregate to £42,500.

The claim is for money lent in September, 1886, at 5 per cent, interest, and is secured upon the debtor's life estate, and also by a bill of sale dated 25th September, 1886. upon the furniture and effects at Steephill Castle. The debtor appears to have received about £500 of this amount, the remainder being paid to the mortgagees for arrears of interest, and for law costs. Total claims of fully-secured creditors (exclusive of the claim of the British Mercantile Insurance Company), £39,750. The life estate upon which these sums are secured, consists of the following property—In the Isle of Wight (1) Steepbill Castle and grounds of about 30 acres; (2) About 45 acres of meadow, paddock, and allotments; (3) Rew Farm and Steephill Down; (4) The marl-pit, Steephill; (5) The ground rent of houses built upon Steephill estate (6) Four houses in Ventnor.

"debts due to the estate, £2,124 17s. 8d.; £13,224 17s. 8d. The debtor is also entitled to a reversionary interest in an estate called Pipwell, of the estimated annual value of £1500; contingent on his present wife dying childless in the debtor's lifetime. At the date of the receiving order, the Sheriff was in possession under three executions. I am not yet in a position to report upon the conduct of the debtor, or upon his dealings with his estate, but the above explanations will assist the creditors in forming their judgment on the nature and value of the assets. In his statement, in which he shows surplus assets of £8,132 3s. 4d., the debtor attributes his failure to the insufficiency of his income to keep down the interest on mortgages and premiums on life policies, and to maintain Steephill Castle, and the loss of rents.

The Official Receiver (Mr. S. S. Wheeler) presided at the meeting named, and, after reading the list of creditors whose proofs had been lodged with him in time for voting at the meeting, and announcing the receipt of other proofs since, said the debtor was not there, but was represented by his solicitor (Mr. T. Hamilton Urry) who had a reason for his non-attendance. There were a large number of creditors present, and proofs amounting to over £4000 were filed.

Mr. Urry said Mr. Hambrough was very unwell, otherwise he would certainly have been in attendance. It was only on the previous day that he was advised by his medical attendant on no account to travel. He produced a certificate from Dr. John Whitehead, of Ventnor, to the effect that the debtor had been under his care for the past month suffering from general nervous exhaustion, with weak and irregular action of the heart. His condition was such as to preclude his travelling, since any excitement or fatigue would be dangerous. In addition to the certificate, Mr. Urry produced an affidavit of verification from Mr. A. Houston.

The Official Receiver said the statement of affairs was on the table. As all the creditors had had copies, it was not worth while that he should read it.

The representative of Major Elers, the holder of the bill of sale, said that, according to his instructions, the statement as regarded that bill of sale and the deed of mortgage for £2500 was not correct—he did not know in what particulars.

The Official Receiver produced an office copy of the bill of sale, and said he thought the reference to it in his report was strictly accurate.

A creditor observed that there were no particulars as to the amount of the arrears of interest in paying off which part of the £2500 was expended.

The Official Receiver said Mr. Hambrough had not yet been up for his public examination. The statement was made up from information supplied by him, and he had no doubt himself that it was quite accurate.

Mr. Urry said the entry as to the arrears of interest was made in the statement to show that the debtor had not the command of £2500 in cash, but only of £500."


"of £500.

The Official Receiver read the answers to the statutory questions, in the course of which the debtor said he formerly kept a cash-book, ledger, and expenditure book, but in the year 1882 a receiver was appointed, with his concurrence, on behalf of the mortgagees, and since that time the books had not been posted. He had no money in hand at the date of his petition. He estimated his life interest to be worth at least £10,000 in excess of the charges upon it. As to the other causes to which he attributed his failure, he named the losses incurred by the farming of Rew Farm while unlet. He said he had for some years been aware that his current income was insufficient to meet his expenditure, but Steephill Castle had been practically in the market for five years, and he had lived in the hope that it would find a purchaser, the effect of which would have been to benefit him in two ways, first by relieving him from the expenses of keeping the place going, and next by increasing his income through the investment of the proceeds of the sale. He was not prepared to admit that he was insolvent, except in the sense of not having assets immediately available to meet his liabilities. He was advised that the long-hoped for sale of Steephill Castle was on the point of realisation, and if that were accomplished, his pecuniary position would be so much improved that a judicious scheme of arrangement would lead to all his creditors being paid. His income for the past three years had been—1884, gross £5240, net £1570; 1885, gross £4890, net £1350; 1886, gross £4900, net £830. During the present year, he had had practically no income, by reason of rents falling in arrear. The annual amount of his personal and household expenditure was about £2500. He had made no marriage or post-nuptial settlement.

The Official Receiver said he was very sorry that the debtor was not there. He believed it was purely owing to illness.

Mr. Urry then submitted a draft scheme of arrangement, as to a great deal dependent on the contemplated sale of Steephill Castle being carried into effect. No contract for the sale was in existence, but he believed the negotiations had arrived at such a pitch as that a contract was pretty certain to follow. He believed it had cost nearly £1000 a year to keep it up and pay rates and taxes. In the event of the sale the debtor would be relieved of this expense, and have his income materially augmented by the interest of the purchase money. The scheme proposed to retain a sum—the amount was left blank, but Mr. Urry named £600—for distribution amongst the creditors, and to pay the balance of the income to the debtor by way of allowance for maintenance.

Mr. Chatteris (Madame Elise and Co., Regent-street) asked the value of the property to the reversion to which the debtor was entitled.

The Official Receiver said £1500 a year.

Mr. Chatteris said if that were to fall in, the £600 clause would have to be taken out.

It was stated that the uncle of the debtor, at whose death the reversion would fall in, was 55 years of age, the debtor being 39, and there was no probability of issue to the uncle.

Mr. Urry said that the reversion was charged.

Mr. H. R. Hammond said there were plenty of people who would take the reversion. It had a marketable value—he should think a very high one."

Image 3:
"Mr. Urry said there was a reasonably well founded expectation that the creditors would be paid in full.

Mr. Hammond suggested that it would be much better to realise the reversion.

Mr. Urry said the principle upon which they had proceeded was to keep the estate intact.

Mr. Hammond said that was a question for the creditors.

The representative of Major Elers said that as a matter of fact this reversion was charged to the Eagle Insurance Company.

The Official Receiver said he believed it was charged, though he was not aware of it when he made his report.

Mr. Hammond said that the bill of sale for £2500 needed a good deal of investigation.

Mr. Urry said if the security was bad on the bill of sale, it was good on the estate.

Mr. Hammond said he knew a good deal about the bill of sale, and he did not think it could hold water against the general body of creditors. He took it that the payment of interest was a preference. The Eagle Office knew the debtor's position at the time, and he was sure that Mr. Hambrough would admit that he never for a moment supposed that he was only going to receive £500 for the benefit of the general body of creditors. The transaction was fraudulent on the general body of creditors.

Mr. Urry: Technically, no doubt it was. There was a good deal of worldly wisdom in raising the money as it was, or he did not know what the mortgagees would have done.

The Official Receiver thought Mr. Hambrough expected to receive the whole of that money.

Mr. Hammond said he borrowed money on the strength of the advance and promised to pay creditors with it.

Mr. Urry said no doubt he was excessively mortified to find that he was only to receive £500 in cash.

In reply to Mr. Chatteris, Mr. Urry said he did not think the power of presentation to St. Catherine's, Ventnor, was worth much. It was included, as was every conceivable thing, in the security.

Mr. Chatteris said he did not think they could do any harm by allowing the estate to be vested in the Official Receiver to do the best he could for them. The clause as to the £600 a year would have to be expunged. If the debtor came into £1600 a year it ought to be handed to the creditors.

The Official Receiver said provision might be made for that in the scheme."

Image 4:
"Mr. Chatteris proposed that the scheme be amended in that respect, and that, subject to such amendment, it should be adopted.

In reply to questions it was stated that Mrs. Hambrough had no settlement.

Mr. Urry said it was proposed to impose these duties on the Official Receiver because he was well acquainted with this class of business, and he knew of no one likely to carry them out so well as he. Asked whether the Official Receiver would try the questions which had been alluded to, Mr. Urry said he would if the creditors imposed that duty upon him.

The Official Receiver said he took it that the scheme would give him all the powers and duties of a trustee in bankruptcy, and it would be the duty of a trustee in bankruptcy to investigate the bona fides of the bill of sale. If the scheme were carried out he should most certainly investigate it.

Mr. Hammond said that in the scheme the creditors were giving all and receiving nothing; he did not know what they were to gain by it. He thought it would be very much better to allow the matter to be carried through the Bankruptcy Court.

The Official Receiver said the mortgagees would immediately go into possession.

Mr. Hammond said that, under any circumstances, the creditors would not study them."

Image 5:
"Mr. Urry said that under the scheme they wanted to nurse the estate and to pay the creditors 20s. in the £.

Mr. Hammond thought it better to keep a hold over the debtor. He did nothing under the scheme but what they could compel him to do. In fact he rather limited them and said "Although I may have £2000, you shall not have more than £600."

Mr. Urry said he did not put forward that sum dogmatically.

A debtor suggested that before anything were divided, a meeting of creditors should be called to say what the debtor should have.

Mr. Urry said that he would not then know how to live. Either let them define what the creditors should have and leave the rest for him, or define what the debtor should have and leave the remainder for the creditors.

Mr. Hammond said that a meeting of creditors might be called whenever £500 or £600 were in hand. They could then decide what the dividend should be and what Mr. Hambrough should have.

The Official Receiver was afraid that scheme would not go through the Court.

Mr. Hammond said let them allow the debtor £100 a year until the creditors were paid.

In answer to a question, the Official Receiver said that if the scheme proposed were sanctioned there would still be a public examination of the debtor, which must take place before the second meeting could be held to confirm the scheme. He thought the amount that should be allowed the debtor was quite open for discussion, but that £100 a year was unreasonable.

Several gentlemen suggested that two-thirds of the income should go to the creditors and one-third to Mr. Hambrough, and Mr. Urry accepted that suggestion.

Mr. Hammond said if the Pipwell estate were to fall in the creditors should have power to call upon the debtor to mortgage the estate to pay them up in full."

Certainly. Here's the extracted text from the image:

"Mr. Urry hoped Mr. Hambrough would be able to compensate his creditors for waiting. He had no objections to their having 4 cent. interest on the amount remaining unpaid from time to time. Mr. Hambrough was a young man, and there was no reason why he should not be able to take his place in the world as a man who had never in any sense or word compromised with his creditors, except to ask them for a little time. If the Pipwell estate were to fall in, he would very soon be on good terms with his creditors.

Mr. Hammond thought it hardly worth £1400 a year.

The Official Receiver said it would be his duty to thoroughly investigate every claim. If any creditor had any other information which he required from Mr. Hambrough, he would take care that it was afforded him if furnished with particulars.

The following scheme was then unanimously adopted:—

"That all the property of the debtor divisible amongst his creditors shall vest in the Official Receiver as trustee, and subject to the provisions of this scheme, to be administered by him in a manner analogous to that prescribed by the Bankruptcy Act, 1883, in regard to an adjudication of bankruptcy. That all debts directed by the Bankruptcy Act, 1883, to be paid in priority to other debts shall be so paid. That the Official Receiver shall realise the household furniture, live and dead stock, and such other effects of the debtor as can be realised, and shall get in and receive all rents and other debts due to the debtor, and, out of the same, pay (a) the above-mentioned debts; (b) the costs, charges, and expenses of these proceedings, and generally in relation to the affairs of the debtor, and the preparation of this scheme of arrangement, and the obtaining the approval of the Court thereto; (c) all interest due to mortgagees, and the annuity due to the North British and Mercantile Insurance Company; and shall divide the balance then remaining in his hands as a first dividend amongst those creditors of the debtor who may be entitled to the same. That the Official Receiver shall get in and receive the rents and other income from the debtor's property as they become due, and out of the same keep down all interest, annuities, premiums of insurance, and other charges, and that the residue of the income shall be appropriated as follows:—Two third parts thereof shall be retained by the trustee for division amongst the unsecured creditors, and the remaining one-third thereof be paid to the debtor by way of allowance for maintenance. That whenever the Official Receiver shall have in his hands a sum of not less than £300 available for distribution amongst the creditors, he shall forthwith declare a dividend. That after payment in full of all the debts, costs, charges, and expenses hereinbefore mentioned to be paid, and also the debts due to the creditors of the debtor, with interest at the rate of 4 per cent. per ann., the Official Receiver shall re-invest in or assign and hand over to the debtor all the property and estate of the debtor which shall at that time be unrealised. That the receiving order be rescinded.""

ISLE OF WIGHT BANKRUPTCY COURT. Rt Utorge Hollis....

R. A. Houston. —The first meeting of the creditors of this debtor took place at St. John's Chambers, Ventnor, on Tuesday, Mr. Samuel Wheeler, the Official Receiver, presiding. The proofs filed were —Dr. Whitehead, £45 13s; Mr. P. Owen, wine merchant, £32 19s.; Mrs. James, fishmonger, £10 11s. 10d.; Mr. A. Scott, ironmonger, £35 7s. 6d; Mr. F. Corb sold, wine merchant, £16 4s. 9d.; Mr. Sims, Commercial Hotel, £13 1s. 8d; Mr. T. R. Saunders, £18 19s.; Mr. W. Guppy, £10 9s. 1d.; and Messrs. J. and A. Morgan, tailors, Ryde, £57 4s. Mr. Wheeler said no statement of affairs had been filed, as the debtor had been and was still very unwell, and quite unable to see anyone on special business; but that morning Mr. T. H. Urry, his solicitor, had made a draft statement which had yet to be signed. From this he gleaned that the creditors not yet proved were—the administrators of S.G. Beavis, £60; the Principal of the Convent, Ventnor, £12; Mr. T. A. Raynes, £30; Mr. H. B. Ribbands, £15; estate of C. J. Spary, £12 11s. 6d.; Mr. R. H. Tolman, £40; Mr. Alford, jeweller, £7; Mr. Beavis, hosier, Ryde, £1 17s. 9d.; Mr. C. E. Cavanagh, £4; Messrs. Drover and Son, £2 10s.; Mr. Deighton, £1 10.; Mr. Levi Eldridge, £5; Mr. George Gough, butcher, Wroxall, £7; Mr. R. James, £1 14s.; Mr. W. M. Judd, £1 18s. 3d.; Messrs Norris, £1; Messrs. Norman and Sons, £1; Mr. W. J. Pile, Fenchurch-street, E.C., £4 7s. 9d.; Royal Hotel, Limited, £6; Mr. W. Stringer, £4; Messrs. W. H. Smith and Son, £1 1s. 6d.; Mr. C. A. Smith, £4; Mr F. Wheeler, £7; Messrs. W. Wallis and Co. £3 19s. 6d.; total £502 9s. 3d. The partly secured creditors amounted to £213 8s. The debtor's life was assured in two office, one for £250 and the other for £100, the former being held by the National Provincial Bank, in security for money advanced to the amount of £210. The total liabilities were thus £715 17s. 3d. The assets included 5s. in hand; furniture (estimated value], £80; balance of claim against the estate of Mr. D. A. Hambrough, £405 7s. 2d., &c., a total of £192 2s. 1d, from which they must deduct preferential claims, £80. The Official Receiver pointed out that he believed the National Provincial Bank were quite prepared to stand on their claim against the Hambrough Estate, in which case the liabilities would be about £502, and the assets £400. The debtor, who came to Ventnor in 1874 as land agent to Hr. Hambrough, and now holds the office of clerk to the Ventnor Local Board, attributes his failure to his inability to recoup the money paid by him for Mr. D. A. Hambrough, and non-receipt of money due to him. He had no offer to make to his creditors.—A short discussion ensued amongst the few creditors present, Mr. T. R. Saunders contending that it was great mistake that Mr. Houston was ever made bankrupt, as he made one of the fairest offers a man could made, namely, to assign the whole of his claim upon the Hambrough estate to his creditors, and pay 4 per cent. interest until they were fully paid up —Mr. Morgan said he withdrew that offer, but several other creditors denied it, and the meeting terminated, the Official Receiver saying, as a matter of course, as there was no proposition to the contrary, the debtor would be adjudicated a bankrupt, with himself as trustee.

Isle of Wight County Press - Saturday 07 July 1888

ISLE OF WIGHT BANKRUPTCY COURT. At Newport, on Wednesday, before the Registrar (Frederick Blake, Esq.)... Re ALEXANDRE' HOUSTON —of Ventnor. estate agent and clerk to the Ventnor Local Board. The debtor appeared for his public examination, and in reply to the Official Receiver he said he came to Ventnor in 1874. He was then agent for Mr. Hambrough's estate at Steephill. A large portion of his assets consisted of claims against the Hambrough estate.—Q. How did those claims arise?—A. They consist of arrears of salary and moneys which I raised from time to time to meet iabilitiee of Mr. Hambrough's, expecting ultimately that I should get repaid.— Witness entered into details of his connection with the estate, and stated that he made a proof against the estate of Mr. Hambrough, which was admitted, and he had received • dividend upon it. The amount so received he expended in meeting certain claims, some of which were incurred on account of the Hambrough estate, witness giving figures and other particulars. His life was insured in the Mutual for £250, and the policy was with the National Provincial Bank as security for an overdraft which had accrued entirely on Mr. Hambrough's account. There was another life policy of £lOO, which he had handed to the Official Receiver. —Q. Have you anything to say about the probability of your receiving a dividend in full from the Hambrough estate?—A. I believe it must be paid sooner or later.—Q. Do you regard your debt against the Hambrough estate as eventually • good one?—A. Undoubtedly I do. —Q. Have you any reasons for forming so favourable an opinion in regard to it?—A. Yes. I know Mr. Hambrough's affairs must be cleared up . sooner or later. I know the estate is improving, and things are looking very prosperous. Only last Saturday I was informed that all the mortgage claims had been paid off, greatly improving the prospects of the estate.—Q. Having regard to the amount of your liabilities and to the estimate you have formed of your assets, do you think your creditors will eventually be paid 20s. in the £?—A. I am certain I should have paid them 20s. in the £ if they had let me alone.—Q. What is your claim against the Hambrough estate?—A. A little over £5OO.—Q. So that if the whole of that is realised there will be • prospect of your paying your creditors in full. What was the immediate cocasion of your tiling your petition?—A. The writ issued by Messrs. Morgan. —Q. After the service of the writ did you enter into certain negotiations with Mr. Morgan with the view of settling the debt . privately —A. Yes.—By Mr. Morgan: At a meeting of certain creditors witness made an offer of an assignment. Did not remember stating that such a deed would have to be registered, but such a remark was made. Was aware that it would have to be registered.—Mr. Morgan: I was most willing to fall in with such an arrangement, and left with the understanding that the deed would be registered. Why was that not carried out?—Witness said so far as his recollection served him, the arrangement was not carried out because he was asked to hand over, not only his claim upon the Hambrougheetate, but his life policies and furniture, which be objected to do.— Mr. Morgan said all that was withdrawn afterwards. He was not wishing to find fault with Mr. Houston in the least; but statements had been circulated in the Press which had been very prejudicial to him, commercially and socially, and of which something more might be heard later on.—The Official Receiver said no doubt the objection to registration came from Mr. Houston, but in justice to him it should be stated that why he changed his mind was because it was pointed out to him that to omit two large creditors from an assignment of this kind, as was proposed to be done, would in all probability result in a hostile bankruptcy. The debtor passed his public examination.

VENTNOR. Steephill Castle.— The Pall Mall Gazette last week published a statement to the effect that the Crown Prince of Germany was negotiating for Steephill Cattle for the season. Although fhe writer evidently jumped at conclusions, and stated more than facts, yet we are pleaded to glean that there is a remote possibility of the Undercliff sheltering that Royal visitor during the summer months.
