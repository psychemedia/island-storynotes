## When the Island Went to War With France — An Account

Many cultures are defined, in part at least, by the battles that you might be expected to remember that somehow shaped a country's history: the battle of Hastings, for example ("1066 and all that" as  W. C. Sellar and R. J. Yeatman had it in 1930), Culloden, or the Battle of Stirling Bridge; the Battle of the Boyne, or the Battle of Irfon Bridge. Or the battle of Bosworth Field, the last great battle of the Wars of the Roses. Amongst them all, the *Battle of St Aubin* may not familiar to many today, or indeed, to anyone. But it does feature in Isle of Wight history, as the time the Island went to war with France, and lost.

### Backstory — Both Sides of the Roses

*Edward Woodville, the Isle of Wight Army and the Battle of St Aubin*

Now you might not think the Wars of the Roses, and the intrigue surrounding it as the Houses of York and Lancaster fought for the English crown in the latter half of the 1400s would have had much relevance to everyday life on the Isle of Wight; but island connections run far and wide. But our story starts there, or thereabouts.

Elizabeth Woodville's parents had caused a great scandal of the day — her father, Richard Woodville, was gentry, rather than nobility, and had married up: to Jacquetta of Luxembourg, widowed in 1435 at only nineteen years of age after just two years of marriage to much older the Duke of Bedford, brother of Henry V and uncle of Henry VI, last of the kings of the House of Lancaster. Elizabeth's father, Richard, had been in service to the Duke of Bedford, and his lesser rank meant scandal ensued when he married the 21 year old dowager Duchess of Bedford, aunt of the only slightly younger Henry VI. Jacquette was fined for not securing Royal Assent, but the 15 year old King Henry VI pardoned her after several months.

The Woodvilles, it would seem, had arrived. Richard was a fine military campaigner, and served well, being elevated to the rank of the first Earl Rivers (Lord Rivers). In England, tensions were high between the houses of Lancaster (on the throne) and York. Assembling an expeditionary force against the Yorkists in Sandwich, the Lancastrian siding Richard Woodville, along with his son Anthony, was captured by followers of Richard Neville, the Yorkist Earl of Warwick. They were taken to Calais and given a dressing down ("you're not a proper Lord, you're an upstart, a nothing") before making their escape back to England.

Warwick returned to England, and laid siege to the Tower of London, which at the time was under the protection of the Lancastrian Lord Scales as the King marshalled his forces in the North. As the Tower fell, Lord Scales was allowed to leave, but was killed by Yorkist boatmen as he made his way up river. Perhaps it was opportunistic, perhaps it was love, but six days later, Scales only heir, his daughter, and another Elizabeth, was to marry and swell further the acquired titles of the Woodvilles: Anthony Woodville, son of Richard, was now Lord Scales and landowner in Middleton near Kings Lynn.

At this point, fortunes in the Wars of the Roses turned, and following a series of battle in 1461, Edward, of the House of York, took the crown as Edward IV, with Warwick a key power broker in the royal court. King Henry VI (of the House of Lancaster, remember) who by all accounts suffered from what could only be termed as bouts of madness, his wife, Queen Margaret of Anjou, escaped to Scotland.  

The political and military heritage of the Woodvilles, rather than any noble birthright, perhaps did the Woodvilles no harm. Initially emprisoned, they were then pardoned, and even welcomed into the Yorkist camp in an early example of political reconciliation. 

Elizabeth Woodville, Anthony's sister, may only have been of middle rank, but she was certainly a great beauty. Following the death of her first husband and follower of the Lancastrian cause, in battle at St Albans, her remarriage elevated the Woodvilles further: for she became Elizabeth, wife and queen consort of the Yorkist Edward IV.

The story has it that the 22 year old Edward was smitten when he first saw Elizabeth, to such an extent that he was moved to plant an oak — later referred to as The Queen's Oak — in the grounds of the family manor, Grafton, in Northamptonshire on the spot where he first saw her. It is said that the very same oak stood until the 1940s, when it was 24 feet round.

Already a widow, and with two young children, the lustful had King tried to have his way with her at an early meeting; but despite holding a knife to her throat, she showed no fear and held firm: obviously, a woman who could also be trusted... The King's obsession eventually resulted in marriage, albeit a secret one at first. *En route* from London to Leicester in April 1464, he broke off at Stony Stratford "to go hunting"; instead he made way to Grafton, secured Elizabeth's hand in marriage and thence straight to the marital bedchamber. He later returned to the court "exhausted by the hunt". The marriage was to remain secret for several weeks, but with Warwick trying openly trying to arrange for the King to marry into the French Royal bloodline, Edward had to 'fess up. The new royal couple were the talk of the country. And the Edward spared no expense for his new wife's coronation.

If things were looking good for Elizabeth, there were no less so for her brother, Anthony, rock god of his day, polymath, and a champion of England. If you cross the captain of the England football team with a heavyweight boxing champion, you may get a sense of how Anthony was regarded as a prize tournament fighter of his day. As with international sporting events today, politics could sometimes play a part in driving nationalistic further. Perhaps through machinations of the King, a challenge was arranged between Anthony, Lord of Scales, Champion of England (yeah, roars to the left) and Antoine, le grand bâtard, the Bastard of Burgundy (yeah, roars the right; but boo, heckles to the left).

And so it was, June 11th, 1467. Two grandstands, one of which was used for the Royal Court, provided a view of the lists, 90 yards long and seventy yards wide, about the size of a soccer pitch today. You can imagine the roars, the sense of sporting occasion, the coloured banners flying the champions stealing themselves for this international face-off: Anthony, Lord of Scales, brother to the Queen, (yeah...) versus the Bastard of Burgundy (boo...)

The first day saw the lists: the champions mounted their chargers and hurtled towards each other: and missed; at the second pass, the bastard was dismounted, but "foul, ref" was called.

The next day was hand to hand combat; Anthony, Lord of Scales, his visor up, taking the upper hand, or so he claimed, Antoin, le grand bâtard, fighting back. Another draw; and Antoin was called away by the death of his father. A return match was held three months later, in Burgundy, again with much fanfare, but this time, Antoin did not compete. Edward's use of sport to help smooth the path of diplomacy had paid off, though, and he secured an alliance with Burgundy. Warwick was not best pleased: in addition to failing to secure a tie between the crown and France by marriage, not only had the King gone and married little more than a commoner and put paid to those plans, he'd now gone and sided with an enemy of France too.

Whilst the King's Council was largely made up of the more powerful Lords, Edward trusted also extended outside the council, not least to the Woodvilles. Richard Woodville, Lord Rivers, became Constable of England and Lord Treasurer, and Anthony acquired another title, Captain of the Isle of Wight and constable (warden) of Carisbrooke Castle.

For Warwick, perhaps sensing his power was on the decline, this was all getting too much, not least when Edward refused to sanction the marriage between Warwick's daughter Isabel, to Clarence, Edward's younger brother and heir. Following a rebellion in the North in Spring 1469, swiftly put down by the Earl of Warwick, Richard Neville then began to mount his own rebellion. After secretly organising the marriage of Duke of Clarence and his eldest daughter, rebellion was raised. A skirmish near Northampton preceded the Battle of Edgcote, also known as the battle of Banbury. Following the battle - a win for the rebels — Richard Woodville and his second son, John, were captured at Chepstow, taken to Coventry (?Kenilworth) and executed.

With Richard Woodville's death, his eldest son, Anthony, brother to Elizabeth, now became the second Earl Rivers, in additional to Lord Scales and Captain of the Isle of Wight.  

As a result of the rebellion, the King had been captured and emprisoned at Warwick Castle. But lacking popular support, Warwick and Clarence were in no position to seize further control, and the King wagered his release and returned to London. Despite being forgiven, Warwick would not let things lie and again fostered rebellion in April 1470. Anthony, second Earl Rivers, was sent after them and captured a fleet of their ships at Southampton. Warwick and Clarence escaped to France with a King's reward out for their capture. Meanwhile, Anthony picked up another office: Captain of Calais.

You can probably imagine Ricard Neville, Earl of Warwick's ire at this point. Whilst in France,  he now teamed up with his enemy's enemy in the form of Queen Margaret, wife of the deposed and slightly bonkers King Henry VI (House of Lancaster, remember); perhaps as a way of hedging his bets, another of Warwick's daughters, Anne, to Margaret's son, Edward. So now he has a foot, via two of his daughters, in the royal line of each side: via Clarence, brother of Edward IV, the reigning King of England, of the House of York; and via Edward, son of Margaret and King Henry VI of the House of Lancaster, currently imprisoned in the Tower of London following his capture in 1465.  

In the other camp, we have the Woodvilles, again linked by marriage in a convoluted way to each camp: Elizabeth, wife of the Yorkist Edward VI, following a small and secret marriage, was daughter of Richard Neville. Richard Neville, the first Earl Rivers, was once in service to the Lancastrian Duke of Bedford, before marrying Jacquetta, the old Duke's widow. Via the old Duke, Jacquetta had become sister-in-law to Henry V and hence uncle of Henry VI.

Got that? Simples.


TO DO: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Neville,_16th_Earl_of_Warwick

??child, edward death, warwick death, etc ??Anne then married Richard III??

The sudden death of Edward IV meant the title of King of England passed to Edward V, Elizabeth Woodville's son. Richard, Duke of Gloucester, whom we know today as Richard III, assumed the protectorate, and took charge of the twelve year old prince at Stony Stratford as Earl Rivers escorted him to London, presumably en route for a coronation. Around about this point, the young Edward V, along with his brother Richard, disappeared. We know them today as the Princes in the Tower, but not for sure what became of them. Richard claimed that Anthony had been conspiring against his nephew and had him sent to Pontefract Castle, whereupon Anthony was executed, bequeathing his title of Lord Scales and the Lordship of the Isle of Wight to his younger brother, Edward. Not surprisingly, Richard, Duke of Gloucester and soon to be king, did not recognise this. Edward Woodville fled to Brittany with 300 men, teaming up with another, previously exiled, claimant to the throne: the Earl of Richmond; or to give him his family name, Henry Tudor.

As it was, Richard's reign was short lived. Within a couple of years, Henry Tudor — Henry VII — had invaded Britain and defeated Richard III in battle to take the crown.

At this point, let's just check back on Elizabeth Woodville, sister of the now deceased Anthony and the exiled Edward. We have already mentioned how her sons by Edward IV, Edward and Richard, the Princes in the Tower, were prevented from taking the throne — missing, presumed dead — by the machinations of Edward IV's brother Richard III. But her daughter and presumed heir of Henry VI, also called Elizabeth, was still in the mix, and soon to regain the role of queen consort for the Woodville family line, this time as wife to Richard III's successor, Henry VII. (The genealogists among you might care to seek how the newly formed dynasty of the House of Tudor essentially reconciled the Houses of York and Lancaster, but it is too complicated for this tale!)

So with Henry VII on the throne, the Woodvilles were back in favour. A marriage was on the horizon, and Edward Woodville, uncle of the previously uncrowned Prince, the now assumed dead Edward V, as well as brother of the soon to be Queen consort, Elizabeth, took on the Captaincy of the Isle of Wight and with it what was to become his island residence, Carisbrooke Castle.

### An Aside – On The Matter of Brittany and France

At this point, we need to talk about the French. We're talking just over five hundred years ago, remember. At the time France was still in a process of shakedown: Brittany was definitely not France, and Burgundy was also maintaining its independence. In the matter of what became known as *La Guerre folle*, 'The Mad War', Henry VII was conflicted.

If you think the tale we have told so far of English in-fighting is complicated, you'll be glad to know this story will not even attempt to explain what was going on in the matter of France versus Brittany. Suffice it to say, Britain had a long history of alliance with Brittany, and many of the other European power blocks were allied against France's attempts to assert itself as a larger unified kingdom. But France *had* helped Henry VII in his campaign against Richard III in Brittany. So Henry made a decision: he would keep out of it.

### When The Isle of Wight Went to War With France

So there we have it. Brittany asks the King of England for help. Several voices campaigned that Brittany should be supported against French attack, Edward Woodville's among them. But Henry VII was adamant: no-one from England should go to the support of the Bretons. No-one from England should get involved.

Now, folk from the Big Island might read that as a simple enough ban on getting involved.

But to Edward, what could be clearer? He had lobbied to support Brittany, and surely Henry knew full well that he held the captaincy of the island. Clearly, the Isle of Wight was exempt, not being a part of the mainland. And so, Edward *should* set to to raise an army to take to Brittany. Which he duly did.

My, how clever the King was, to have found a way to command Edward to lend support, whilst at the same time keeping France happy that he was doing no such thing. And if he kept things secret and didn't tell the King that he had decoded the King's secret command, there would be plausible deniability on the part of Henry. Brilliant!

And thus it was that from an island population of about 5000 or so souls, Edward assembled together almost 500 men and set sail for mainland Europe in support of the Bretons.
 
In May 1488, a delegation came from Brittany to Henry's court, lobbying  for hist support one last time. But still Henry remained neutral. On their return, they stopped off at the Island, and plans were sealed.

The troops sailed from St Helens to St Malo. When Henry heard a week later of their arrival in Brittany, he was not best pleased.  A letter was sent to the Charles VIII of France, trying to explain the situation away:

> We have just at this hour been advised of the fact that the Brittany Ambassadors… made their way, therefore, to the Isle of Wight to meet Sir Edward Wydeville, Knight, known as Lord Scales, on which island he has made his residence, and where, for long years now, he has been Governor, by our royal appointment; and by the force of their wily manipulations, manoeuvres and exhortations, managed to persuade him, to the greatest of my displeasure, to go to Brittany with them; for this expedition Sir Edward mustered up to around three hundred men, mainly by granting them amnesties, as most had been guilty of offences and crimes over the years, with the result that most of these departed neither equipped nor dressed for war. Thus he gathered together those people on said isle, which is completely surrounded by the sea, so very secretly and hastily that we were not made aware of the fact until after their departure.
