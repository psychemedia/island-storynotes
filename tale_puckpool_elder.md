TALES AND LEGENDS OP THE ISLE OF WIGHT.

WITH THE ADVENTURES OF THE AUTHOR IN SEARCH OF THEM, BY ABRAHAM ELDER, ESQ.

UPON our arrival at Ryde, we took up our quarters at Yelf's hotel. A mutton-chop, and a glass of hot brandy-and-water each after dinner.— At length the antiquary remarked,

"I know you are a great admirer of Shakspeare. It is very odd that the Puck, or Robin Goodfellow, of his Midsummer Night's Dream, who appears to have been a very popular spirit at that time, should now be scarcely known to the world, except through the medium of that play. The Isle of Wight, indeed, is the only spot that I am aware of where there remain any traces of his existence. There are two places here that are still called after him, Puckpool and Puckaster."

"Any traditions relating to them?"

"There are," was the reply. " The evening is delightful," continued he, " and Puckpool is close at hand, — what say you to a walk there before tea, and I will tell you a story about it as we go along."

After a walk of about a mile and a quarter, we got to Puckpool. It was a low marshy flat, close to the sea. The antiquary began as follows:—

"At the date of the following story, this spot is described as having been a kind of salt marsh, entirely overflowed by the sea at high spring-tides. In ordinary tides, there was left bare a green meadow, covered by the peculiar race of plants that will bear contact with salt water. The sea, however, had eaten its way through it in numerous directions, forming narrow channels, deep holes, and here and there wide spaces were scooped out, which were filled by the tide at high water, leaving numerous islands and promontories around. It was the largest of these pools, with a round green island in the middle, that gave the name to the place.

"People used to come from far and near to visit this spot; not, however, on account of any particular beauty it possessed, but from the number of wonderful tales that had been told about it. Robin Goodfellow, or Puck, with a troop of mischievous and frolicsome fairies, made it their favourite place of nocturnal meeting. Numerous were the pranks that they played. A tidy housemaid sometimes, upon getting up in the morning to her work, would find everything swept, and brushed, and scoured, and the floor nicely sanded, upon which the prints of little feet could be faintly traced, and the brooms and brushes and dusters carefully put back into their places. If she was particularly industrious, it is said that she actually sometimes found a piece of money in her shoe. But the slovenly girl was punished with cramps, teased with chilblains, and was occasionally frightened to death by the rats running across her nose when she was in bed. The consequence was, that the neighbourhood of Puckpool used to be celebrated for tidy housemaids and steady servants.

"Those who were in favour with the fairies were continually meeting with good luck, and those they took a dislike to were as constantly getting into scrapes in one way or another. Sometimes the swine-herd, driving his grunting flock home in the evening, would see his fattest or his favourite pig separate from the herd, and trot down to the salt marshes of Puckpool; and there he would follow it about, sometimes upon the sound greensward, sometimes across the channels that the tide had left, in some places over tolerably firm sand, in others both driver and swine would be floundering in soft mud. At length the poor man would tumble headlong into the deepest and dirtiest hole, while his grunting dependant was making his escape, capering away upon the firm grass beyond. After his fruitless chase, he would return home and find with surprise that none of his herd were missing.

"But the people they delighted the most in teasing were hypocritical and luxurious monks. Those who were sincere in their devotions, and strict in their observance of the rules of their several orders, they did not appear to trouble themselves much about. As, however, the convents became wealthy, they in a great measure ceased to be the refuge of devoted ascetics; and many younger brothers, of small prospects in life, enticed by the abundance and the idleness that the monastic establishments presented to their view, professed themselves monks. The enjoyment of as much luxury and pleasure as they could cover with their religious habit was, of course, their sole aim. These were the devoted victims of the practical jokes of Robin Goodfellow and his merry companions.

"Brother Martin was a monk of the Cluniac order, belonging to the Priory of St. Helen's. Originally, the very severe rules of that order were there followed with the strictest accuracy. Constant silence was observed during the day, and it was almost death to violate it before prime `[Morning service in the chapel.]`; and various other contrivances were adopted to mortify the flesh. ' Their manual labour,' says Udalricus, ' was to shell unripe beans, or weed the garden, and sometimes make bread in the bakehouse.' `[Fabas novas etnondum bene maturas de folliculis suis egere, vel, &c. &c. — See Udalricus Antiquiores Cousuetudines Cluniacensis Monosterii in D'Acherii Spicilegium, iv. 39.]` But the precise rules of the order would not be very interesting to the reader, particularly as the Priory of St. Helen's soon grew wealthy, and its monks, in consequence, negligent and luxurious.

"Brother Martin entered the Priory of St. Helen's during the later period of its existence. The absence of labour and the plenty of provisions were the chief inducements that led him to choose a religious life. He was generally absent from the convent upon some excuse or another, visiting the poor, and giving good advice to those whom he considered to be the most likely to be led into temptation. He was the father confessor to most of the ladies of the neighbouring village of La Rye, as Ryde was then called. He generally visited the most comely first, as he said these were the most likely to be led astray

"In the course of time a little orphan niece of his was brought to the village of La Rye, and was supported entirely by his charity; but many of the neighbours were much surprised to observe, that whenever any very particular inquiries were made about this niece, the monk appeared to take it almost as a personal offence.

But then it was well known that religious men were always instructed not to be ostentatious in their charities, and to shrink from the applauses of the profane world. However, let this pass.

"One night Brother Martin was returning from La Rye to his convent. By some strange accident, that never has been satisfactorily accounted for, he missed the beaten track, and wandered through the footways that traversed the copsewood in various directions; for there was at that time very little open country between La Rye and the Priory of St. Helen's.

"After various windings, the track he had followed led him down to the salt marshes of Puckpool. Here he stood for some time pondering in his mind how he should get across it; for there was a stream of water that ran through the middle of it, the fording of which, without getting very wet, was rather a nice business by daylight, when the tide was out; but now he had only the light of the moon, and the tide was rising fast.

"As he stood on the brink of the firm ground, considering which was the safest point to make for, he thought he heard the cries and screams of a child. He walked up and down the firm turf, trying to make out whence the screams came. The cries continued.

"'Where are you?' said the monk.

"'Oh! Father Martin! — dear Father Martin, is it you?'

"'And who are you?' he asked.

"'Oh! it's little Fanny — your own little Fanny — your own dear little Fanny.'

"'And where are you? — for I cannot see you.'

"'Here, on the pretty green island in the middle of the marsh. I can't get out — I can't get out. The tide is rising, and the water is coming all round. There are some stepping-stones just up above— pray come and save me, pray! '

"The monk walked up a little higher, and soon thought that he had made out the stepping-stones. He rushed to go across, putting his foot upon what looked in the moonlight like a fine broad stone. It was, however, unfortunately for the monk, nothing but a floating tuft of sea-weed that had come up with the tide. This untoward step threw the monk head foremost into a deep muddy inlet, about three feet deep Brother Martin soon emerged again in woful plight; the full sleeves of his black cowl were heavy with the weight of the soft brown mud and half-rotten sea-weed with which they were filled; his rochet, or tabard, which reached from his chin to his feet, was torn in two by his trampling upon it in his efforts to extricate himself. By dint of spitting and spluttering, he soon cleared his mouth of water and dirt; and, after taking one or two good blows to recover his breath, he waded, or rather floundered, through the water and mud till he came to the little green island. Here he scrambled up, and, after shaking a little of the water and mud out of his gown, he began looking about for the child, and was much surprised to find that it was nowhere on the little plot of firm ground upon which he had landed. He soon, however, heard again the screams of the child, and, upon turning round, he observed it standing and screaming on another little turf island, still farther off. It cried out again —

"'Save me! — save me, Father Martin! — My dear father, save me, my own dear father! — for the tide is coming in, and the water is getting deep all round me!'

"The monk, before he took to the water again, turned the matter over in his own mind. In the first place, he did not wish to see the little child drowned; and, in the second place, as he had got half way across the marsh, it would be as easy to get out on that side as on the other. Indeed, the probability was that he had come across the worst part.

"He determined, however, to proceed with more caution this time; so he looked about for a shoal part, till he thought he had come to a place that was quite shallow: here he sat himself down upon the edge of the turf, and tried with his feet whether the bottom was hard. To his delight, his foot rested upon a firm sound sand, so he started forward on his journey; but when he put his other foot before him, it sank in up to his knees, and again he fell prostrate. To be sure, there was very little water this time; but such a bed of mud as that in which he rolled about, he had never met with before. He rolled, and he floundered, and he scrambled; and when at length he reached the firm ground with his extended arms, he was quite exhausted, and he remained for a few seconds in this attitude, his head and face scarcely emerging from the muddy water. Here he was greatly alarmed; for a large green crab, either disturbed in its slumbers, or coming in with the flowing tide, crawled over his face; and two or three bats, apparently surprised at the sight of so unusual an object, fluttered by him so close, that he could distinctly feel the wind from their wings.

"He turned his eyes upwards, and saw a large bird hovering over him: — he thought of the Eastern tales that he had heard of, — eagles and vultures tearing the flesh from the bones of their victims before they were dead. At length it uttered a loud hooting sound, which he recognised as that of the yellow owl. He then heard with dismay the whirring prolonged note of the goatsucker, which sounds so melancholy and unearthly. The monk gave another plunge to extricate himself from his slimy bed, but was again startled by another sound, totally unlike anything he had ever heard before — *Wha, whee, wha, whee, wha whee*, — repeated many times in rapid succession. He tried to discover whence it came, but could see nothing but a number of oysters lying along the edge of the water, opening their shells and shutting them one after the other. The sounds he thought evidently came from them. ' Horrible! horrible! ' thought he; ' they must be possessed by demons, and that is their note of laughter.' He plunged again to extricate himself, and, as he plunged, he began ' Exorcise te,' &c. But his exorcism was suddenly arrested by a lump of mud and sand flying into his mouth, and almost going down his throat.

"A violent effort at length freed him from his unpleasant situation, and once more he stood upon firm ground; but he was now so completely frightened, and so entirely did he lose his presence of mind, if he ever possessed it, that he thought of nothing but escaping from his present horrors. The danger of the unfortunate child in his fear he forgot altogether, or concluded that it was a mere trick of evil spirits; so he ran away in the direction of the Priory of St. Helen's as fast as he could. But his career did not continue long without disaster; for in his haste he did not proceed with his accustomed caution. His foot dropped into a hole, and again he was doomed to fall; but this time, luckily for him, with the exception of one leg, he fell upon dry ground.

"Whether it was his fears that conjured up forms, or whether it was reality, he thought that the green crabs were again running over him, the bats flapping their wings in his face, and the owl hooting over head; but, at any rate, he felt quite sure that he heard distinctly in the distance behind him the oysters laughing at him in their former peculiar note, *Wha, whee, wha, whee*. He soon jumped upon his legs again, nor did he stop until he reached the gates of the convent. As he ran, he heard a sound like that of wind whistling by his ears, and then he felt something cold laid upon his cheek, — cold and clammy like a dead man's hand: he trembled and shook, and ran on the faster.

"The porter was astonished at his appearance; and well he might be: his black monastic dress had been changed to a rich brown, and little streamers of sea-weed fluttered in various directions. One side of his face was plastered with brown and black mud, while the other showed its accustomed rosy shining fatness. He ran directly to the prior, and told him that Brother Martin had returned in woful plight, and appeared to be deprived of his reason. He was ordered into the presence of his superior. The prior received him in his parlour. He was sitting in his sculptured easy arm-chair, with his clasped hands resting upon his portly paunch, while his eyes staring wide open, showed the astonishment with which he viewed the strange alterations that had taken place in the monastic habit and countenance of Brother Martin.

"Brother Martin was directed to change his dress and to purify himself; an operation which was soon accomplished, for monks were never celebrated for cleanliness. Indeed, this was one of the particulars in which they used to cheat the world; for the uninitiated ignorantly imagined that the filth in which they lived was a kind of penance, and they were taught to revere it under the name of the ' odour of sanctity,' — whereas the fact was that the monks delighted in dirt, — it was one of their luxuries.

"When the unfortunate brother reappeared, he commenced his story. He told how he had been led astray from the beaten path by some unknown and mysterious influence, and how at length he found himself by the waters of Puckpool. He then began to generalise a little. The screams of his own dear little Fanny were simply described as the cries of a fellow-creature in distress. He went on to tell how he plunged into the swelling ocean, regardless of all personal risk, in the hopes of being able to save this fellow-creature from a watery grave, — how he was nearly drowned in the deep water, — how he was nearly smothered in the mud, — how he was haunted by demons in every shape, — how the owl hooted over him, — how the bats flapped their wings in his face, and the green crabs crawled over his cheek, — how hideous sounds were heard on every side, — how the oysters, by the power of some strange enchantment, opened their shells and laughed at him.

"'Why did you not repeat the "Exorciso te"?' asked the prior.

"'I did attempt it; but no sooner had I opened my mouth than one of the demons threw a piece of mud down my throat that nearly choked me. At length I extricated myself, and ran away; and, though I was again thrown down by violence, and once more surrounded by my tormentors, I got up, and, as I ran away again, I felt the cold hand of a dead man placed upon my cheek.'

"'Might it not have been the end of your wet hood that blew up?' asked the prior.

"'Impossible.—As I came on, I thought to myself—'

"'Stop!' said the prior, with pompous gravity;' you know the rules of our order, — you ought to have continued singing psalms inwardly to yourself, to prevent vain thoughts and idle imaginings from entering into your mind. `[The monks of this order, whatever their occupation was, were directed constantly to sing psalms to themselves, with the exception of the master baker. The reason of this exception, was to prevent the saliva from dropping into the dough. — See Fosbroke's Monasticon.]` The story you relate is wonderful, and your sufferings have been great: I will order you some mixtus, `[A composition of which wine was a principal ingredient.]` and direct a second supper to be served up for you in the misericorde,' " `[The misirecorde, or hall of indulgence, was placed just outside of the other building, so that the monks could declare that it was not within the walls of their convent. Here, consequently, they were not subjected to the same strict rules as in the refectory, such as silence during meals, &c. ]`

From Ryde we proceeded to Newport on the top of the coach. The first object that met our view as we drove into the town was our friend, Ragged Jack, lounging up and down the street, with his hands in his pockets, waiting the arrival of the coach, to which he acted as cad. When he descried his old patron, Mr. Winterblossom, he pulled his hands out of his pocket, lugged off his hat, and ran to assist the antiquary to descend, taking one of his feet in his hand, and placing it here, and another there, and then offering his arm to land him on the ground.

"Anything else besides the pockmanty, sir?"

"Only a small bag."

As soon as Jack had secured to himself the job of getting the luggage, he returned with them to the antiquary.

"Lor'! sir; I am so glad to see your honour again. I have often thought of you while you was away. I never expected that you would have come back to the Isle of Wight again. And, how well your honour 's looking, and I am right glad to see it."

"I understand," said the antiquary, slipping a shilling into his hand.

"No, sir; 'tisn't the shilling that I was fishing for then," said Jack, looking at the coin that he held in his open hand, and then up in the antiquary's face. " I should be heartily glad to see your honour again, if I never hoped to get another shilling from you. There's many a gentleman chucks me a shilling, but they seldom speaks a kind word to me, as your honour does. And there's Mr. Elder, too, and God bless him!" said he, pocketing the antiquary's shilling, and came to see whether he could do anything for me.

We were soon comfortably settled again in our old quarters; and Jack, as soon as he had deposited our luggage, sauntered up and down the street, whistling "Cherry Ripe!" but taking care not to lose sight of our door.

At length we sallied forth to visit Carisbrook Castle, which the antiquary's sudden departure from the island had prevented us from exploring last year. The moment we got into the street. Jack (I never could make out how) immediately guessed our intention.

"If you are going to Carisbrook, sir, I know the history of every stone in the castle."

"You may come with us, then."

As we walked along I most unexpectedly fell in with an old Oxford friend of mine. He was now performing the part of a private tutor, and had come down to the Isle of Wight with two pupils, to cram them (as the Oxford slang goes) for their degree. I introduced him immediately to Mr. Winterblossom, whom he said he had known well by reputation before, though he never had had the pleasure of meeting him. They were walking up to the castle too, so we joined parties. As we passed under the portcullis, the antiquary drew himself up with a proud feeling of patriotism. " Now we are indeed on classic ground. Here Vespasian fixed his fortified camp to overawe the island, after his bloody victory on Arreton Down. Here was King Witgar buried, from whom it anciently received its name, — for the Saxons called it Witgaresburg. He formed it into a Saxon fortress. Here afterwards reigned King Stuff, sole monarch of the island. It was somewhere here, probably, that he caused, his six prisoners to be burnt alive, to deter other adventurers from invading his beautiful island.

"Upon these Roman and Saxon foundations, soon after the Conquest, William Fitz-Osborne, Earl of Hereford, built his Norman fortress, and extended the area of the fortifications. Through these is the tilt-yard, where the tournaments and trials by combat were held, — where Isabella de Fortibus, the lady of the Isle of Wight, so celebrated in its local history, graced the splendid tournaments with her presence. The towers between which we passed are of the time of Edward the Fourth. See, the very wooden gate itself remains. The terror of the Spanish armada caused the castle to be surrounded with more effective fortifications in the reign of Elizabeth. And, look! — look at the ruins here on the left: there was the unfortunate Charles confined. That is said to be the very window through which he vainly attempted to escape. And here, young man," said he patting one of the Oxonians on the back, " on the right is the Castle Chapel; it is dedicated to the Popish idol or saint that presided over youth and scholars."
