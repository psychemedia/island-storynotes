Two Britons charged in connection with the biggest seizure of cocaine in Britain were today due in court.

Customs officers investigating the seizure of cocaine worth £40 million on the Isle of Wight charged the pair last night.

The Britons, a man and a woman, were among six people charged with attempting to smuggle cocaine into the UK. They were all due to appear before magistrates in Portsmouth today.

Eight people were arrested on Monday after 50 Customs officers swooped on a 37ft luxury yacht off the coast of the Isle of Wight.

Officers said 300 kilos of the drug were in the process of being unloaded from the boat onto a rigid inflatable vessel and a further 200 kilos were discovered on a nearby beach.

A Customs spokesman said: "This is the biggest ever seizure of cocaine in the UK."

The Britons due in court today are Michael Tyrrell, 53, a company director from Brook, near Southampton, and Julie Paterson, 44, a cook from Blofield, Norwich.

The four others charged are Robert Kavanagh, 53, from New York; French national Didier Lebrun, 46, a designer living in Florida; jobless Belgian James Peterson, 41, of no fixed abode; and Venezuelan Germao Henao, 46, Customs officers said.

Two other British women arrested in connection with the swoop were released on bail and a ninth person, a Frenchman, arrested yesterday, is still being questioned by Customs officers in Portsmouth.

Record Pounds 40m cocaine haul seized

COCAINE worth Pounds 40million was seized when customs investigators carried out a predawn raid on a sloop near the Isle of Wight yesterday. Eight people were being questioned last night.

The haul, believed to be the biggest in Britain, came after the yacht was boarded off an isolated cove near Ventnor.

The huge find came at the end of a month-long investigation by Customs and National Crime Squad officers. The operation has dented the supply of class A drugs by breaking the back of an important criminal gang, the police said.

As the 1,100lb haul of cocaine was being offloaded from the 37ft Blue Hen at 5am yesterday, more than 50 customs officers and police officers lay in wait.

When the inflatable reached the shore at Orchard Bay, near Ventnor, some of the waiting customs and National Crime Squad officers emerged from their hiding places and ordered the men to surrender. At the same time, 12 other officers, who had been lying in wait in a blacked-out coastguard cutter, pulled alongside the sloop, which was showing no lights, and boarded her.

Five men, one British, one French, two Americans and a Venezuelan, were arrested. At the same time three women were arrested at addresses along the South Coast.

At first the officers, some of whom are believed to have been armed, thought that the haul was 660lb, with a street value of more than Pounds 25million, but a search of the area uncovered another 440lb hidden near by.

As the suspects were taken to police stations in the Portsmouth area, Jim Fitzpatrick, assistant chief investigations officer for the Customs, said: "We believe that this joint operation will have a serious impact on the supply of cocaine throughout the UK."

Channel swoop nets a GBP 40m cocaine haul

BRITAIN'S biggest cocaine haul half a ton of the drug worth GBP 40million on the streets was seized yesterday as a gang of smugglers sailed into a Customs and police trap.

Months of international surveillance paid off after dawn raids on an Isle of Wight beach and a yacht two miles out to sea.

'The seizure is a major blow to drug traffickers across the nation and has made a major and significant dent in the underworld market,' said a jubilant Customs spokesman.

Last night nine people, including three British women, were under arrest and being questioned at various police stations in Portsmouth.

Fifty officers from Customs and the National Crime Squad took part in the 5am raids.

The bulk of the haul came from a high-speed inflatable intercepted as it headed towards Orchard Bay, Vent-nor, from a U.S.registered 37ft yacht called the Blue Hen moored in the Channel. Nine hours later teams discovered over 400lbs more of the drugs on a nearby beach.

The yacht was impounded and towed to Portsmouth.

A Briton, a Frenchman, two American and a Venezuelan were arrested at Orchard Bay.

The three British women were held as police carried out raids across the South of England.

The ages of those held range from 30 to 50.

Customs spokesman Ranald Macdonald said: 'This is the biggest seizure of cocaine we have made in the UK.' He added: 'At five this morning most of the cargo was offloaded into the inflatable from the mother vessel. The inflatable brought it to shore and we went in and arrested several people.

'At the same time several others were arrested in raids on properties in the South and on the Isle of Wight.

We cannot rule out any more arrests.'

THE common-law wife of a convicted international drug smuggler lived a life of luxury while helping to launder her husband's millions, Snaresbrook Crown Court, in south-east London, heard.

Jill Margaret Fuller, 54, a former teacher from Wiltshire, has been the partner of Michael Tyrrell - now serving 26 years for his part in the importation of GBP 40m-worth of cocaine into the UK - since 1995.

From 1995 to 1999, Fuller and Tyrrell bought properties in the UK and set up companies that were used to launder drug money, the court was told on Thursday last week.

Outlining the prosecution case, Tracy Ayling detailed four properties with a combined value of GBP 1,127,000 that Fuller and Tyrrell bought in the four years.

The pair set up an upmarket handbag shop at one of their properties at 3 Fish Row, Salisbury, and used the company to launder profits from Tyrrell's drug-smuggling empire, the court was told. "Customs and Excise accountants analysed the bank accounts of Tyrrell and Fuller in relation to the Fish Row business, and found that large sums of money passed through the accounts which cannot be accounted for.

Ms Ayling then told how Tyrrell and Fuller had bought a GBP 260,000 country home in Hampshire in 1996, 3 Fish Row in 1997 for GBP 100,000, and a small cottage in Love Lane, Salisbury, for GBP 67,500 in 1998.

But the biggest buy came the next year, when the pair bought Orchard Bay House, on the Isle of Wight. It was this mansion that Tyrrell used to channel drugs into the UK.

Ms Ayling went on: "On February 12 this year, Michael Tyrrell was convicted of smuggling cocaine with a street value of approximately GBP 40m into the United Kingdom.

"The importation took place at Orchard Bay House on the south coast of the Isle of Wight.

"It is not the Crown's case that Jill Fuller was involved in the importation.

"It is that, knowing Tyrrell to be a serial drug smuggler, she involved herself in the purchase of several properties and lived an extravagant lifestyle, knowing this was funded by Michael Tyrrell's illegal activites."

Fuller, of Love Lane, Salisbury, denies one count of concealing the profits of drug-trafficking.

The trial continues.

From country girl to Cocaine Queen;
She was a farmer's daughter who walked out on her marriage to the scion of a Norfolk dynasty for the glitz of the Caribbean yachting set. Then Julie Paterson fell obsessively in love with a self-confessed drug runner …

THE house was in one of the loveliest locations on Antigua, surrounded by wooded hillsides and lush greenery. It was precisely what Julie Paterson had been looking for and she liked it at once. She chatted to the owner as he showed her around and, although he was not what she would call an attractive man, there was something about him she found appealing.

He was urbane, witty and immensely charming. When she asked him what he did he smiled.

"I'm a drug smuggler," he said and they laughed.

It had not been a joke. Michael Tyrell, from one of the Caribbean island's wealthiest families, was indeed a crook. He moved in the glamorous circles of Antigua's yachting set, he knew everyone and enjoyed his rakish reputation as one of the island's characters.

But he had been to jail and many of his friends were professional criminals.

Julie Paterson found him irresistible. She bought the house and, even as the deal went through, they became lovers.

The year was 1994. She was 38 years old, he was 10 years older.

Their affair was intense and allconsuming, conducted with a passion she had never known. They would spend hours at their favourite table in the Commissioner's Grill restaurant in St John's, where Tyrell would relate his harum-scarum tales of drug running, risk and adventure.

Paterson was enthralled. When Tyrell talked of his plan for a huge operation - a drug run that could make him $ 10 million (£6 million) she knew she wanted to be in on it.

It was a decision that was to cost a huge slice of her life.

Julie Paterson, now 46, is currently beginning a 24-year jail sentence. She has been dubbed the "Cocaine Queen" after helping Tyrell and his gang smuggle nearly half a ton of cocaine into Britain.

This vast quantity of the drug had a street value of £100 million and the profits were to have made them all rich. As she sits in her cell at Holloway prison, Paterson may reflect on the irony of this. Many years ago, as a young woman, she walked away from wealth to find freedom.

She was 24, the wife of James Paterson, scion of a Norfolk landowning dynasty. There was a certain inevitability about the marriage of Julie and James. She was born to the land. Her father was a successful livestock breeder and she had spent an idyllic childhood at the family home, Primrose Farm, in the village of Skeyton near the Norfolk coast.

At North Walsham Girls' High School most of her friends were from local farming families. As a teenager she joined Aylsham Young Farmers' Club and, at 17, she won a competition in which the prize was a holiday in Denmark, on a farm.

It was always expected that she would marry a farmer. James was young, rich and devoted. But, four years into the marriage - as Julie saw her life unfolding in precisely the same, predictable way as her mother's had done - she decided to break free.

It was 1978. She took £10,000 out of her bank account and boarded a plane for Europe. She headed for the Mediterranean, drawn to the heady glamour of the yacht harbour towns and the playgrounds of the seriously rich.

The sybaritic lifestyle of the yacht owners, their guests and crews, exerted a powerful influence on the farmer's daughter from the rolling fields of Norfolk. She signed on a sailing yacht as crew and soon earned a reputation as a talented sailor, undeterred by heavy weather and hard work. She crossed the Atlantic three times under sail and she loved her new career at sea. But the day she sailed into Antigua she knew her life had changed forever.

ENGLISH HARBOUR is one of the most beguilingly beautiful spots in the Caribbean. Its perfectly sheltered anchorages, Georgian quaysides and impeccable natural beauty attract sailors from all over the world. When Julie Paterson saw it, she knew she wanted to stay.

"I think she fell in love with the place," her friend Samuel "Fergie" Derrick said. He is a local businessman who knew Paterson and Michael Tyrell well.

"She was really besotted with Mike," he said. "And he is quite a character.

He told me he used to be a racing driver and his father, H G Tyrell, made a lot of money when he bought a mountainside on the island over at Parham and built houses on it.

"But Mike was always a bit wild.

He is a very charming man, welleducated and well-read, but he made no secret of the fact he was into crime. I knew he'd been in trouble over in Guadeloupe and here in Antigua, too. But he always told me he only smuggled marijuana. 'Fergie,' he'd say, 'I'll never do the hard stuff.' That was why I was surprised when I heard what happened with all that cocaine."

When Julie Paterson and Tyrell met she was running a successful yacht charter business. But. while she counted among her acquaintances people who owned yachts worth tens of millions of dollars, she was always an outsider looking in. To really belong in this world it was necessary to be rich, very rich.

The cocaine run was to be her entrHe.

Tyrell had a friend, Frederic Fillingham, a boatbuilder and sailor who had jumped parole after a drug-smuggling conviction in the United States.

Fillingham knew a man called Robert Kavanagh, an immensely wealthy American who lived in one of the most beautiful houses on Antigua.

Kavanagh had links with a Colombian cocaine cartel and he set in train the moves that were to lead to Tyrell's gang taking delivery of 396kg of high-grade cocaine.

It seems incredible that Tyrell, a convicted smuggler, believed he could hold meetings with other men linked to the narcotics trade without arousing the suspicions of the many agents of the US Drugs Enforcement Agency. But he blithely went about recruiting his gang, keeping rendezvous with known criminals including a Colombian cartel member, apparently believing he was safe.

But he was not safe. He had been detected and, in Britain, Customs investigators and police set up one of the biggest surveillance operations ever mounted. Operation Eyeful kept secret watch on Tyrell and Paterson months before they landed their valuable cargo on a deserted beach on the Isle of Wight.

The spot was picked carefully.

Although his affair with Paterson had by now cooled, the couple remained committed to their plan.

Tyrell picked up the pieces of his longstanding relationship with his partner Jill Fuller, and - with their three children - moved back to Britain to the village of Brook in the New Forest. Villagers remember the family at Saddler's Cottage well. They had horses, a Range Rover and an Audi TT, and they seemed to be doing rather well from the exclusive leather goods shop they ran in Salisbury.

In fact, the shop was a front for a money-laundering operation. It was used to process drugs money and Jill Fuller was sentenced to four years' jail for her part in it.

As she ran the shop, Tyrell worked on his big smuggling coup with Julie Paterson. She made frequent visits to Saddler's Cottage and her seagoing experience was to prove crucial. The cocaine was to be smuggled into Britain by yacht.

Under her guidance the 38ft sailing cruiser Blue Hen was prepared for a voyage across the Atlantic with the cocaine stuffed inside its hull. Paterson was to await its arrival in Britain.

In December 1999, Tyrell bought Orchard Bay House on the south side of the Isle of Wight. He paid £7,000 more than the £675,000 asking price, but the house was vital to his plan. It has its own private beach, set in a cove on a deserted part of the island. This was where the cocaine was to be landed.

With the cocaine stashed aboard, the Blue Hen took 32 days to cross from the Caribbean. When she arrived off the Isle of Wight Tyrell and Paterson were waiting.

They had a high-speed inflatable boat standing by to unload the cocaine.

But, as the Blue Hen took up position, the weather began to worsen. A stiff breeze blew up and a heavy swell began crashing on to the island shore.

CUSTOMS men watched secretly from the land and a boat offshore as the plastic bales of cocaine were unloaded from the Blue Hen. One of the men on duty that night was Mike Rees, a former Customs cutter commander based at Cowes. Mr Rees, now retired, witnessed at first hand the drama that was about to unfold.

"We had been watching the place for months," he said. "We had taken officers from the Customs National Intelligence Service out so they could take photographs secretly.

On the night of the bust I was in a 24ft fast boat, waiting about two miles out. As they landed in their boat we crept in closer and closer, and then our men pounced."

The Customs men were reinforced by police officers from the National Crime Squad, and the plan had been to arrest the smugglers as they landed the cocaine on the enclosed beach at Orchard Bay.

But the smugglers' boat used to ferry the drugs ashore broke down and they finally landed at Woods Bay, a mile away. They then had to struggle on foot - with their £100 million burden - along a winding and treacherous clifftop path to Orchard Bay House, which was to be used as a staging depot for the drugs.

The gang panicked and ran as police and Customs made their move. Julie Paterson, who had been waiting for the drugs to come ashore, bolted. She hid in the grounds of a holiday home complex but was quickly found. Only later did she learn she had taken refuge close to the Isle of Wight's Museum of Smuggling.

Tyrell was sentenced to 26 years' jail when he was convicted last March for his part in the plot. Julie Paterson was sentenced last Tuesday.

She could be 60 before she is released and now, as her jail term begins in earnest, Customs investigators are looking at the possibility of confiscating gang members' property.

Julie Paterson was born into a world of comfort, even privilege, and she married into wealth. But the farmer's daughter from Norfolk wanted more; she craved excitement, thrills and risk. She found them all during her short-lived reign as the Cocaine Queen.

  Operation 'Eyeful': two jailed for drug trafficking - British woman receives 24 years after customs operation; Gang jailed for total of 145 years years

A woman received one of the longest jail sentences ever handed down to a female drugs trafficker. Julie Patterson was jailed for 24 years and Frederic Fillingham received a jail term of 18 years for their part in an attempt to smuggle 400 kgs of almost all pure cocaine, with a street value of GBP 90 million, by yacht to the Isle of Wight from the southern Caribbean Island Bequia.

Julie Anne Paterson, (46) British, living in Parham, Antigua but originally from Norfolk, was actively involved in preparing the 'Blue Hen' Yacht for sail and used her sailing skills to brief the crew on use of navigational equipment and landing sites. She is the former girlfriend of Michael Tyrell who was sentenced in March 2002 to 26 years for his part in organising the importation attempt. Paterson was a member of the party observed by Customs officers waiting for the drugs to arrive on the Isle of Wight beach. beach.

Frederic Fillingham, (43) American, from Fort Lauderdale, Florida, USA sentenced to 18 years. Fillingham was on the run from the US authorities for violating his 15-year parole having been convicted for drug smuggling. As well as recruiting others as crew, he used his boat building skills to make the boat used, the Blue Hen, fit for the transatlantic voyage. Paterson and Fillingham were found hiding together in the grounds of a local holiday complex and arrested by Customs Officers in the early hours of 23 October 2000.

These convictions mean all of the eight people arrested in October 2000 as part of Customs and Excise Law Enforcement Operation 'Eyeful' have been jailed and brings the combined prison sentence to 145 years. It also brings an end to prosecutions brought as a result of this operation.

The conviction of Paterson and Fillingham follow the earlier convictions of Michael Tyrell, Robert Kavanagh, Dider Lebrun, Laurent Penchef and German Henao in March 2002 all for drugs trafficking offences and that of Jill Fuller in April 2002, the wife of Michael Tyrell, for money laundering offences.

Assistant Chief Investigation Officer for Customs and Excise, Jim Fitzpatrick said: "This gang tried to smuggle a huge quantity of cocaine into the UK and have received jail terms that reflect the seriousness of their crimes. We will now ensure that we go after every penny we can identify has been made from their drugs trafficking.

"The excellent co-operation between staff at Customs and Excise and the National Crime Squad has ensured that an international drug smuggling gang has been broken up and the drugs are off the streets of the United Kingdom.

"Class A drugs not only have the potential to destroy the lives of those who buy them and their loved ones, but also to those who traffick in them, as can be seen from the severity of the sentences passed today."

NOTES TO EDITORS

1. The defendants were arrested in the early hours of the morning on 23 October 2000 following an intensive three-month surveillance operation on the principal Michael Tyrrell. In December 1999, Tyrrell purchased Orchard Bay House near Ventnor on the Isle of Wight. This is one of the only properties in the country to have a private beach and was purchased by Tyrrell with the intention of using it to land the drugs.

The operation code-named "Eyeful" culminated as officers awaited the arrival of the yacht 'Blue Hen' from the Caribbean. Ironically after over a 3000 mile, 32-day Atlantic crossing the operation took an unexpected twist. The yacht crew launched their inflatable dinghy off St Catherine's Point with the drugs on board but the engine failed.

Adverse weather conditions and strong tidal currents forced the inflatable 1 mile from its destination to land at the remote beach of Woody Bay.

As customs and police watched, the smugglers made desperate attempts to haul the consignment along the treacherous cliff path to Tyrrell's home. However Customs and police struck seizing 400 kilos of cocaine worth up to GBP 90 million, one of the largest hauls of cocaine in recent years. The investigation spanned over 14 different countries, including Europe, America and the Caribbean, helping to smash this international drugs organisation.

Fatally addicted to danger;
Julie Patterson grew up as a quiet country girl...sowhy did she become hooked on a need for excitement and risk? It led to a 24-year jail sentence for drug smuggling

LATE on a tropical Antiguan night, two Britons were the last diners at the Commissioner's Grill. They relied on the whirring ceiling fans at the waterfront bistro to muffle their conversation as the waitress poured a third bottle of Beaujolais Villages.

Julie Patterson leaned across the table for another forkful from the plate of lobster she was sharing with her new lover.

The beautiful brunette yachtswoman was clearly intoxicated, but not by the wine. Indeed, Julie had a reputation in this former British colony in the West Indies for holding her liquor better than most men.

It was her partner Mike Tyrrell's fantastic plans for the future which held her completely spellbound.

With the fortune he said he had earned from his career as a marijuana smuggler, he was going to go 'legitimate', he confided, establishing a ferry company and a yacht charter firm. And he was inviting Julie to be his partner. Virtually everyone in Antigua who crossed paths with Tyrrell including the restaurant owners who claim he still owes them for that romantic meal eight years ago suspected that Julie's suitor, now 55, was a ruthless, sociopathic crook.

And for Julie the evening marked the beginning of a reckless and inevitably doomed attraction which would culminate last week in a 24-year prison sentence for cocaine smuggling, the stiffest ever imposed on a woman in a drugs case.

Tyrrell persuaded Julie to use her sailing skills to help him plan a brazen attempt to smuggle a GBP 100 million shipment of cocaine into England. It was a record amount and the sordid adventure earned her the notorious sobriquet the 'Cocaine Queen of the Caribbean'.

It is an incredible story of obsession, danger and callousness. But it is also the story of how a young woman became addicted to danger and suffered catastrophic results.

For Julie, 44, was born into a world far removed from the one she craved.

The daughter of a respected gentleman farmer from Norfolk, she grew up in a highly-conservative, Rightwing, privileged rural community.

It was a world of private girls' schools, of ponies and young farmers' associations. But rather than settle for the only life on offer as a pearls and twinset farmer's wife she developed a love of the fast life, first, on holiday among the jet-set yachtees in the South of France.

She got sucked into an existence she found more exciting and ended up in the Caribbean.

There she surrounded herself with a dissolute, filthy-rich crowd where drinks and money were freely available, scams frequent and sex easy.

While others of her generation had grown out of their rebellious phases, it hit Julie late and struck while she was in the worst company decadent ex-pats and a roguish reggae crowd that would have horrified her parents and the stolid young farmers back home.

Last week I travelled to Antigua to learn about her life with the island's rich yachting fraternity. There I met another of her former lovers, Charles Western, the affable 41-year-old owner of a boat-building company, who testified in Julie's defence at the trial.

He told me: 'Julie always insisted that she had a good settlement from her ex-husband but this is an island with a lot of wealthy people and she felt quite insecure.

'Julie is a goodtime girl who is easily persuaded to do things that she thinks will be fun. One of the things she said she liked about Antigua when she arrived was there were no drink-driving rules.

'She liked to go out and party pretty hard. She was like one of the lads, up for anything. She smoked like a chimney, told dirty jokes and her favourite drinks were rum, wine and beer. She could do ten beers, a good session of rum and a bottle of wine and still walk.

SHE and Mike were the perfect match.

She wasn't getting any younger and she was working very long hours, catering for a yacht she chartered out.

She'd cook the meals and then work as crew.

'She was making good money but not great money. She confessed to me that she was looking for a man she could settle down with and hoped to get married again.

'With Mike, she could drink, chat and laugh and he told her fantastic stories about the ideas he had that really pulled her in. He was setting her up. She discovered that he was cheating on her with another woman, the wife of one of the island's most influential lawyers.

He'd told the other woman he loved her too and set her up in a house in England. Julie told me, "Mike has broken my heart" but she never stopped loving him.' She was born Julie Windley in June 1956 and grew up on Primrose Farm, her family's idyllic smallholding near Aylsham, just north of Norwich.

At discos and social events, she mingled with the scions of families who were considerably wealthier than her father, Peter, who contentedly farmed a modest herd of Jersey dairy cattle. In 1976, she married James Patterson, who came from a rich Norfolk land-owning family.

It was a large step up the social ladder, but Julie was ambitious and could not settle into being 'a farmer's wife', as she petulantly described her new role.

One old friend said: 'She could have had a comfortable life with Jimmy but it was not good enough for her.' After severing her Norfolk roots, she chose Antigua as a place where she finally could meet people with exciting lives.

The island is a popular wintering hole for bestselling authors, musicians and actors, including Ken Follett, Stephen King, Eric Clapton and Timothy Dalton. However, her immediate problem was finding a way to support herself, since she only had GBP 10,000 in savings. When a handsome Dutch yachtsman invited her out, she was delighted and soon moved on to his boat.

John Fuller, a lawyer on Antigua, takes up the story: 'He turned out to be a drug smuggler and after he was extradited to Holland from the US for smuggling, she took up with Tyrrell. I really think she was attracted to danger.' To Fuller's horror, his ex-wife, Jill, 54, by whom he has three grown-up children, also fell in love with Tyrrell, soon after the suave drug lord began sleeping with Julie.

Tyrrell, like Julie, comes from a comfortable home. His father founded the island's most successful car dealership after emigrating from the UK. His mother owns a toy store in the quaint 18th Century quarter of the island's Georgian capital, St John's.

A boyhood friend of Tyrrell's, Winston Derrick, who now co-owns the island radio station, says: 'Mike just loved thrills. He didn't turn to smuggling because he needed money.

He liked living on the edge.

'He smoked marijuana and braided his blond hair into dreadlocks and when he started smuggling, he was really proud of it.' Tyrrell served a prison sentence for smuggling marijuana but then claimed to have repented. He even wrote a letter to the local paper and signed it 'Retired Drug Smuggler'.

Fuller says: 'Tyrrell persuaded Jill to sell a thriving leather goods business that she owned here and move to England. He told her he was moving too. They bought a lovely house in the New Forest and Mike installed the three daughters he had from an earlier marriage and Jill, being the sweet, kind person that she is, became mother to them.' Their life at a GBP 300,000 house in the hamlet of Brook looked the epitome of Home Counties respectability.

There were two ponies in their paddock and Tyrrell, wearing smart tweed jackets, attended a monthly lunch for retired business people at The Bell, the local pub. Jill drove an Audi TT sports car and bought an exclusive leather shop in Salisbury.

Fuller says: 'Mike was travelling to and from Antigua, he said to start his ferry business, but in fact, as Jill now knows, he was two-timing her with Julie, setting up their drugs operation. I think Julie wanted to prove she was better than any man on a drug-smuggling run. She is tough, fearless and knows how to handle a boat.' Back in Antigua, Tyrrell and Julie were drafting their plans to become cocaine millionaires, preparing an ocean-going yacht, the Blue Hen, for her maiden voyage. Sometimes they would rendezvous in England but by now detectives were tailing Julie as she visited shops selling sophisticated radio and night navigation equipment.

The London court heard how Julie and her lover spent months planning the transatlantic operation before the 37-foot yacht cast off from Antigua with a three-man crew in September 2000 and headed for the Isle of Wight. There Tyrrell and Julie were waiting at Orchard Bay, a GBP 675,000 house he had bought on a secluded cove. But when the Blue Hen finally limped towards the Isle of Wight coast in an October storm and landed at the wrong beach, Customs officers were watching through night goggles as Julie staggered for hours along a narrow cliff path with armfuls of cocaine.

She said she didn't know what was in the packages when she was arrested with Tyrrell and five other gang members. The judge ruled, however, that Julie was the 'dedicated ally' of the 'highly manipulative' Tyrrell. TYRRELL was sentenced to 26 years. He also took his other lover, Jill, down with him.

She was imprisoned for four years after being found guilty of laundering GBP 1 million of the ring's profits money her ex-husband John and other friends insist she legitimately earned from her leather businesses.

Julie is full of self-pity believing she is the real victim of this saga.

She has put on two stone in jail, her once-lovely face is hollow and lined from the sleepless nights when she rails against what she says is her unfair fate.

But like other Caribbean islands, Antigua and, for that matter, Britain is experiencing an epidemic of drug-fuelled crime. So, while many of Julie's old friends are saddened by the waste of a promising life, they have no sympathy for The Cocaine Queen of the Caribbean.

A HIGH-living drugs baron and his four henchmen were jailed for a total of 99 years yesterday for trying to smuggle a record 90million cocaine haul into Britain The gang used an ocean-going yacht to bring their cargo across the Atlantic from a small Caribbean island to the Isle of Wight.

Led by Michael Tyrrell, 55, the brazen criminals even used a former anti -smuggling base as their headquarters.

Their operation was foiled by an undercover team of elite Customs and police officers - and the great British weather.

In September 2000, the gang's 37foot yacht, Blue Hen, set sail from Bequia, an island near St Vincent, with 396kg of cocaine on board. It arrived at the Isle of Wight on October 22.

But with a storm brewing, the smugglers' carefully planned operation soon descended into something akin to an Ealing comedy.

Their ship-to-shore inflatable broke down, forcing them to dump their valuable cargo on a beach half-a-mile from the planned landing site. Then they spent hours stumbling along a narrow, rainlashed cliff path manhandling 20 bales of cocaine to their Orchard Bay base Totally exhausted, they were arrested by officials who sprang from the bushes.

The six-month court hearing at London's Snaresbrook Crown court heard of the lavish lifestyle enjoyed by father-of-three Tyrrell, who has a number of previous convictions for cannabis smuggling.

He called himself the "first white Rastafarian of Antigua" after the island where he grew up and was so "arrogant" he never thought he would be caught. The divorcee owned a 900,000 home in Brook, Hampshire, four other houses and several upmarket cars.

He was found guilty last month and yesterday was sentenced to 26 years in prison. His right-hand man, Robert Kavanagh, 55 - the owner of a palatial 1.4million hideaway on the Caribbean island of St Barts - was jailed for 24 years.

Colombian boat builder and sailor German Henao, 48, was the only one to admit the smuggling charge. He got 13 years. The final two to be dealt with were Didier Le Brun, 49, from Fort Lauderdale, Florida, who skippered the vessel, and his other crew member Laurent Penchef, 32, a dual AmericanFrench citizen, of no fixed address.

They were each sentenced to 18 years. Kavanagh and Henao were recommended for deportation.

Judge Timothy King told the men: "Those who involve themselves in the trafficking of hard and addictive drugs such as cocaine are nothing less than the purveyors of misery, degradation and death."

He went on: "You and others like you have much to answer for. Drug abuse is the scourge of decent civilised societies and one which, on a global scale, costs those societies many billions of pounds.

Five guilty of smuggling dlrs 1.3 billion in cocaine from Caribbean

Four men were convicted Wednesday and a fifth pleaded guilty to drug smuggling charges for sailing a 90-million-pound (dlrs 1.3 billion) cocaine consignment to Britain from the Caribbean.

Customs agents arrested the men Oct. 23, 2000, shortly after they landed 396 kilograms (872 pounds) of cocaine on the Isle of Wight, off the south coast of England.

After a six-month trial at London's Snaresbrook Crown Court, the five now face life imprisonment for smuggling cocaine. They will be sentenced on March 8.

Customs said its investigators spent months trailing the operation's 54-year-old mastermind, Michael Tyrrell, who was British-born but reared in Antigua.

Didier Le Brun, 49, a U.S. national from Fort Lauderdale, Florida, arranged the purchase of an oceangoing yacht to sail the cocaine to Britain.

He was joined on the journey by Laurent Penchef, 32, a dual U.S.-French national, and a Colombian called German Henao, 48, the only one to plead guilty.

Also convicted was American national Robert Kavanagh, 55, who owns a home on St. Barthelemy. He had insisted he was just a house guest of Tyrrell.

Tyrrell bought a property with a private beach on the Isle of Wight in 2000, the investigators said.

Customs men were alerted to him in July, 2000, and began a joint investigation with Britain's National Crime Squad.

Tyrrell, who had been making frequent trips back to Antigua, was kept under close surveillance in Britain.

In mid-September 2000, the Blue Hen stopped at the island of Bequia, near St. Vincent, where it is believed the Colombian-produced drugs were loaded. It set sail on a 32-day voyage to the Isle of Wight, where the gang arrived Oct. 22.

After a battle to get the 20 large bales of cocaine to shore in an inflatable dinghy, the men were arrested by Customs. The department called it one of the largest hauls of cocaine in recent years.

In the following months, a massive evidence-gathering exercise began - with cooperation from U.S. Coast Guards and many police forces in the Caribbean.

"We are absolutely delighted with these verdicts," Jim Fitzpatrick, assistant chief Customs investigation officer, said outside court.

A MAN who led a gang that tried to smuggle a record GBP 90m cocaine consignment into Britain through the Isle of Wight has been jailed for 26 years.

Father-of-three Michael Tyrrell, 55, of Saddler's Cottage, Brook, in the New Forest, was the mastermind behind the operation which featured ocean-going yacht Blue Hen, months of planning and a drug runner's hideaway near Ventnor.

London's Snaresbrook Crown Court heard Customs and Excise officers and police secretly watched every move he made between July and October 2000.

Stormy weather and mechanical failure forced Tyrrell and his accomplices to spend hours staggering along a treacherous cliff-top path at night with armfuls of their precious cargo.

It left them wet, cold, miserable and utterly exhausted. They were just beginning to think things could not get worse when they were arrested.

Twenty large bales of the highly-addictive drug - bound for towns and cities across the country - were seized.

After the 396kg haul had been weighed, officers realised they had seized the largest single UK cocaine consignment to date.

Only one of those detained admitted the single smuggling charge they all faced. The others were found guilty after a six-month trial.

Judge Timothy King told them: "You and others like you have much to answer for. Drug abuse is the scourge of civilised societies and one which, on a global scale, costs those societies many billions of pounds."

Dealing first with Tyrrell, the judge told him it was obvious he was the operation's "overlord".

He said: "You were the boss, the governor, the man at the top of this organisation, the man to whom others looked for orders and instruction. This was your brainchild, your scheme."

Right-hand man Robert Kavanagh, from the Caribbean island of St Barts, was jailed for 24 years. Colombian boatbuilder and sailor German Henao, 48, the only one to admit the smuggling charge, got 13 years.

Didier Le Brun, 49, from Fort Lauderdale, Florida, who skippered the vessel, and crew member Laurent Penchef, 32, a dual American-French citizen, of no fixed address, were each sentenced to 18 years.

Kavanagh and Henao were recommended for deportation.

During the trial, the jury heard that Tyrrell, who settled in Antigua with his parents as a child, brought his family to Britain and bought a GBP 900,000 house at Brook in 1996.

Three years later he bought Orchard Bay House, near Ventnor, on the Isle of Wight for GBP 657,000. It had its own beach, was built 150 years earlier as a base in the battle against smugglers, and seemed like a dream headquarters.

Unfortunately for him, Customs officers learned something was afoot in July 2000, and a joint investigation - Operation Eyeful - swung into action with Britain's National Crime Squad.

In September 2000, Blue Hen cast off, collecting the drugs from the West Indies, before heading to the Isle of Wight. She arrived on October 22.

With the weather worsening, the 20 bales of cocaine were loaded into the yacht's 12ft dinghy. Le Brun then remained aboard while Penchef and Henao headed for Orchard Bay.

Halfway there the outboard motor failed, forcing them to land at Woody Bay, half-a-mile off course. There they abandoned the massive cocaine consignment on the beach and began a treacherous night-time, cliff-top slog to base, where the rest of the gang awaited.

The once sophisticated operation, by now badly fraying at the edges, began to resemble an Ealing comedy script as they then set off in a rowing boat.

After finding the haul, they spent hours carrying the drugs to the house along a narrow, windswept cliff path, regarded as dangerous even in daylight.

It took what was left of the night to stumble back with just six bales of cocaine. Penchef then got the outboard working and the next six went by dinghy

Tyrrell finally decided to throw caution to the wind and try to collect the final eight bales by van. It was then that Customs officers pounced.

150 CUSTOMS OFFICERS POUNCE ON GANG AFTER THEY LAND COCAINE ON BEACH IN STORM; GBP 90M DRUG SMUGGLERS SENT TO JAIL

FIVE smugglers who brought GBP 90million worth of cocaine into Britain were behind bars last night. The elaborate operation, masterminded by Michael Tyrrell, 55, began in the Caribbean and ended when 150 customs officers swooped on an isolated beach on the Isle of Wight.

Tyrrell and his henchmen were condemned as a cancer on society by a judge at London's Snaresbrook Crown Court.

Father-of-three Tyrrell was jailed for 26 years after the court heard how customs officers and police secretly watched every move he made between July and October, 2000. If he had been successful 20 large bales of the highly addictive drug would have been bound for towns and cities across Britain.

After the 396 kilos haul had been weighed, officers realised they had seized the largest British cocaine consignment to date.

Only one of the gang admitted the single smuggling charge they all faced. The others were found guilty after a six-month trial. Judge Timothy King told the five smugglers: "Those who involve themselves in the trafficking of hard and addictive drugs such as cocaine are nothing less than the purveyors of misery, degradation and death.

"I and my colleagues in the criminal courts deal on a daily basis with lives which have been blighted, decimated and in too many cases ruined beyond repair by drug addiction."

The judge went on: "You and others like you have much to answer for. Drug abuse is the scourge in decent civilised societies and one which costs those societies many billions of pounds.

"The likes of you are a blight, a cancer within such societies."

The judge said a "clear and unequivocal" message had to be sent out that such activities would be treated with "zero tolerance." Dealing first with Tyrrell, who claimed he became involved because a Colombian drugs baron threatened to murder his mother if he did not obey orders, the judge told him it was obvious he was the operation's "overlord".

He said: "You were the man at the very top of this organisation, the man to whom others looked for orders and instruction."

He had spent months planning it and large sums financing it. The three weeks Tyrrell spent in the witness box had portrayed a "highly manipulative man, utterly devoid of scruples and prepared to go any lengths to achieve your ambitions". Tyrrell's right-hand man, Robert Kavanagh, the owner of a palatial hideaway on the Caribbean island of St Barts, was jailed for 24 years.

He used his contacts with drug cartels in Venezuela and Colombia to arrange the supply of cocaine.

The next to be jailed was Colombian boat builder and sailor German Henao, 48, the only one to admit the smuggling charge. He got 13 years.

As part of the three-man crew on board the Blue Hen, the yacht used to smuggle the drugs across the Atlantic, he was a "trusted hand".

The last two to be dealt with were Didier Le Brun, 49, from Fort Lauderdale, Florida, who skippered the vessel, and the other crew member Laurent Penchef, 32, a dual American-French citizen, of no fixed address. They were each sentenced to 18 years. Kavanagh and Henao were recommended for deportation.

The jury heard that the plot collapsed as the gang were trying to ferry the consignment ashore in bad weather and customs officers swooped.

A woman received one of the longest jail sentences ever handed down to a female drugs trafficker. Julie Patterson was jailed for 24 years and Frederic Fillingham received a jail term of 18 years for their part in an attempt to smuggle 400 kgs of almost all pure cocaine, with a street value of GBP 90 million, by yacht to the Isle of Wight from the southern Caribbean Island Bequia.

Julie Anne Paterson, (46) British, living in Parham, Antigua but originally from Norfolk, was actively involved in preparing the 'Blue Hen' Yacht for sail and used her sailing skills to brief the crew on use of navigational equipment and landing sites. She is the former girlfriend of Michael Tyrell who was sentenced in March 2002 to 26 years for his part in organising the importation attempt. Paterson was a member of the party observed by Customs officers waiting for the drugs to arrive on the Isle of Wight beach. beach.

Frederic Fillingham, (43) American, from Fort Lauderdale, Florida, USA sentenced to 18 years. Fillingham was on the run from the US authorities for violating his 15-year parole having been convicted for drug smuggling. As well as recruiting others as crew, he used his boat building skills to make the boat used, the Blue Hen, fit for the transatlantic voyage. Paterson and Fillingham were found hiding together in the grounds of a local holiday complex and arrested by Customs Officers in the early hours of 23 October 2000.

These convictions mean all of the eight people arrested in October 2000 as part of Customs and Excise Law Enforcement Operation 'Eyeful' have been jailed and brings the combined prison sentence to 145 years. It also brings an end to prosecutions brought as a result of this operation.

The conviction of Paterson and Fillingham follow the earlier convictions of Michael Tyrell, Robert Kavanagh, Dider Lebrun, Laurent Penchef and German Henao in March 2002 all for drugs trafficking offences and that of Jill Fuller in April 2002, the wife of Michael Tyrell, for money laundering offences.

Assistant Chief Investigation Officer for Customs and Excise, Jim Fitzpatrick said: "This gang tried to smuggle a huge quantity of cocaine into the UK and have received jail terms that reflect the seriousness of their crimes. We will now ensure that we go after every penny we can identify has been made from their drugs trafficking.

"The excellent co-operation between staff at Customs and Excise and the National Crime Squad has ensured that an international drug smuggling gang has been broken up and the drugs are off the streets of the United Kingdom.

"Class A drugs not only have the potential to destroy the lives of those who buy them and their loved ones, but also to those who traffick in them, as can be seen from the severity of the sentences passed today."

NOTES TO EDITORS

1. The defendants were arrested in the early hours of the morning on 23 October 2000 following an intensive three-month surveillance operation on the principal Michael Tyrrell. In December 1999, Tyrrell purchased Orchard Bay House near Ventnor on the Isle of Wight. This is one of the only properties in the country to have a private beach and was purchased by Tyrrell with the intention of using it to land the drugs.

The operation code-named "Eyeful" culminated as officers awaited the arrival of the yacht 'Blue Hen' from the Caribbean. Ironically after over a 3000 mile, 32-day Atlantic crossing the operation took an unexpected twist. The yacht crew launched their inflatable dinghy off St Catherine's Point with the drugs on board but the engine failed.

Adverse weather conditions and strong tidal currents forced the inflatable 1 mile from its destination to land at the remote beach of Woody Bay.

As customs and police watched, the smugglers made desperate attempts to haul the consignment along the treacherous cliff path to Tyrrell's home. However Customs and police struck seizing 400 kilos of cocaine worth up to GBP 90 million, one of the largest hauls of cocaine in recent years. The investigation spanned over 14 different countries, including Europe, America and the Caribbean, helping to smash this international drugs organisation.

GANG JAILED OVER £90m COCAINE HAUL

A gang of drug smugglers were jailed today for sailing a record £90 million cocaine consignment into Britain.

The massive operation was masterminded by Michael Tyrrell, 55, and featured the smugglers' headquarters, an ocean-going yacht and months of planning.

The father of three, who called himself the "first white Rastafarian of Antigua" after the island where he grew up, was so "arrogant" he never imagined being caught.

He was also convinced the drugs run would spell the end of his money worries but the 26-year sentence he got was not quite the solution he had banked on.

London's Snaresbrook Crown Court heard Customs and Excise and police secretly watched every move he made between July and October 2000.

And just when he thought success was assured, stormy weather and mechanical failure forced "drugs overlord" Tyrrell and his accomplices to spend hours staggering along a treacherous cliff-top path at night with armfuls of their precious cargo.

It left them wet, cold, miserable and utterly exhausted. They were just beginning to think things could not get worse when they were arrested.

Twenty large bales of the highly addictive drug - bound for towns and cities across Britain - were seized.

After the 396 kilos haul had been weighed, officers realised they had seized the largest single British cocaine consignment to date.

Only one of those detained admitted the single smuggling charge they all faced. The others were found guilty after a six-month trial.

"I and my colleagues in the criminal courts deal on a daily basis with lives which have been blighted, decimated and in too many cases ruined beyond repair by drug addiction.

"These are for the most part ordinary people who have been driven to commit crimes such as shoplifting, street muggings and burglary in order to feed their cravings.

"Then there are the lives of their many victims, damaged, hurt and all too frequently traumatised by the violence committed against them."

The judge said that he and his judicial colleagues had frequently been painted in the media as "out of touch with the real world" and "living in ivory towers".

That was completely untrue. "They, like me, have to deal on a daily basis with the affects of lives broken by drug abuse. That I might tell you from a judge's perspective is the real world."

He went on: "You and others like you have much to answer for. Drug abuse is the scourge in decent civilised societies and one which, on a global scale, costs those societies many billions of pounds.

"The likes of you are a blight, a cancer within such societies, and in this instance our society in the United Kingdom."

The judge said a "clear and unequivocal" message had to be sent out that such activities would be treated with "zero tolerance".

It was meant particularly for others who might be tempted to grab a share of the huge profits from this "pernicious" trade.

"Let it be clearly understood that however great the risk and however great the profits the penalties meted out by these courts will be even higher."

Dealing first with Tyrrell - who claimed he became involved because a Colombian drugs baron threatened to murder his mother if he did not obey orders - the judge told him it was obvious he was the operation's "overlord".

"You were the boss, the governor, the man at the very top of this organisation, the man to whom others looked for orders and instruction. This was your brainchild, your scheme."

He had spent months planning it and large sums in financing it.

The three weeks Tyrrell spent in the witness box had portrayed a "highly manipulative man, utterly devoid of scruples and prepared to go any lengths to achieve your ambitions.

"You were even vain enough to manipulate the very course of the trial itself … You used the witness box as a platform to assert your warped ideologies and perversions of the truth. That is the measure of you, Michael Tyrrell - a vain, self-interested, arrogant, greedy, manipulative and ruthless man."

It was unfortunate he was a British citizen and could not be deported. "I can think a few whose presence on these shores are less conducive to the well-being of its people."

Tyrrell's right-hand man, Robert Kavanagh, the owner of a palatial two million dollar hideaway on the Caribbean island of St Barts, was jailed for 24 years.

The judge said it was clear he had been "deeply involved" in what went on.

He had used his contacts with the drug cartels of Venezuela and Colombia to arrange the supply of cocaine.

"In short, your role was pivotal. You knew Tyrrell could feel confident that you would deliver and deliver you most certainly did."

The next to be jailed was Colombian boat builder and sailor German Henao, 48, the only one to admit the smuggling charge. He got 13 years.

As part of the three-man crew on board the Blue Hen, the yacht used to smuggle the drugs across the Atlantic, he was a "trusted hand responsible for its safe passage and delivery".

The last two to be dealt with were Didier Le Brun, 49, from Fort Lauderdale, Florida, who skippered the vessel, and his other crew member Laurent Penchef, 32, a dual American-French citizen, of no fixed address.

They were each sentenced to 18 years.

They, too, were critical to the operation's success with Le Brun overseeing the £35,000 purchase of the battered 37ft single-masted vessel he was told he could keep along with a £140,000 payoff after he had sailed the cocaine to Britain.

Penchef, said the judge, was the "watch keeper and helmsman" during the transatlantic crossing and responsible for safely transferring the drug ashore once the vessel had reached the Isle of Wight.

Kavanagh and Henao were recommended for deportation.

During the trial, the jury heard that Tyrrell, who settled in Antigua with his parents as a child, was divorced, had a common-law wife, four houses on a hill and a brace of upmarket cars.

In 1996 he brought his family to Britain and bought a £900,000 house in Brook, Hampshire.

Three years later he purchased Orchard Bay House, near Ventnor, on the Isle of Wight for £657,000.

It had its own beach, was built 150 years earlier as a base in the battle against smugglers, and seemed like a drug runner's dream headquarters.

Unfortunately for him, Customs men learnt something was afoot in July 2000, and a joint investigation - Operation Eyefull - swung into action with Britain's National Crime Squad.

Tyrrell, who frequently visited Antigua, was tracked whenever he was in Britain.

In September 2000, Blue Hen cast off, first collecting the drugs from Bequia, an island near St Vincent, before heading to the Isle of Wight. She arrived on October 22.

With the weather worsening, the 20 large cocaine bales were loaded into the yacht's 12ft inflatable. Le Brun then remained aboard while Penchef and Henao headed for Orchard Bay.

Halfway there the outboard died, forcing them to land at Woody Bay, half-a-mile off course. There they abandoned the massive cocaine consignment on the beach and began a treacherous night-time, cliff-top slog to base, where the rest of the gang awaited.

Meanwhile, Le Brun, worried by the lack of news, ignored orders and sailed towards the house, only for a furious Tyrrell to tell him to turn around and head for the horizon.

Penchef and Henao then arrived and angered him with a description of the drugs left alone somewhere along the coast.

The once sophisticated operation, by now badly fraying at the edges, began to resemble a Ealing comedy script as they then set off in a rowing boat.

After finding the haul, they spent hours carrying the drugs to the house along a narrow, windswept, rain-lashed cliff path, regarded as dangerous even in daylight.

It took what was left of the night to stumble back with just six bales of cocaine. Penchef then got the outboard working and the next six went by inflatable.

Tyrrell finally decided to throw caution to the wind and try to collect the final eight by van.

He had barely started the engine when Customs men pounced. Tyrrell, who has a number of previous convictions for cannabis smuggling, struggled with his captors, later explaining: "You have got to have a go, haven't you?"

Customs minister Paul Boateng said: "This is an excellent result for Customs and the National Crime Squad and demonstrates that by working abroad as well as at home, we can have a huge impact on class A drugs in the UK.

"Customs law enforcement has totally dismantled a sophisticated international drug trafficking organisation.

"These criminals enjoyed wealthy lifestyles with big houses, plush cars and fast boats. We will make every effort to pursue not only the criminals and the drugs but their profits too and hit the criminals where it hurts them most - their pockets."

Jim Fitzpatrick, Customs deputy chief investigator said: "These sentences are a stark warning to those who traffic in dangerous drugs.

"We will pursue their ill-gotten gains as a result of their illegal activity to the maximum that the law allows."

Detective Inspector Dave King, from the National Crime Squad, added: "It is always satisfying when the courts recognise the seriousness of these offences.

"Both the National Crime Squad and Customs will continue to work together to bring to justice those who traffic illegal commodities into the UK."

24 YEARS JAIL FOR WOMAN DRUG SMUGGLER

An accomplished yachtswoman nicknamed the "Cocaine Queen of the Caribbean" was jailed for 24 years today for helping smuggle a record £100 million drugs consignment into Britain.

Julie Paterson and her lover headed an international consortium which spent months plotting the sophisticated transatlantic operation.

But just when success seemed assured, their visions of huge wealth foundered in a near comic farce of stormy weather and mechanical failure.

Trying not to panic, 46-year-old Paterson, partner in crime Michael Tyrrell, 55, and various minions spent hours staggering along a treacherous cliff-top path at night with heavy armfuls of their precious cargo.

It left them wet, cold, thoroughly bad-tempered and totally exhausted.

Then, just when they thought things could not get any worse, customs men caught the seven-strong gang red-handed.

Bale upon bale of the narcotic, bound for towns and cities across the country, were seized, London's Snaresbrook Crown Court heard.

So too, was an inflatable dinghy for inshore work, and the ocean-going yacht that brought the 396 kg haul from the Caribbean to the Isle of Wight's idyllic Orchard Bay.

However, it was not until officers weighed the drugs back at base that they realised they had intercepted the largest single British cocaine importation to date.

Antiguan resident Paterson had relied on a "love is blind" defence.

Despite hosting a pivotal planning summit at her home, and having a handbag bulging with incriminating documents when arrested, she claimed she simply followed orders from the man who owned her heart, and never once suspected anything was amiss.

But she showed no reaction as the five-man, seven-woman jury convicted her of one count of smuggling in October 2000.

Also convicted was US national Frederic Fillingham, 42, from Fort Lauderdale, Florida, who got 18 years.

Described by the crown as the "either end man", he equipped the yacht, helped recruit the crew, and was part of the drugs landing party.

He tried to convince the court he thought he was smuggling Venezuelan artefacts.

Passing sentence, Judge Timothy King told the pair: "You and others like you have much to answer for. Drug abuse is a scourge in a decent and civilised society, and costs civilised society many billions of pounds."

The judge said that, similarly, both Paterson and Fillingham were "a blight, a cancer" on society.

A "clear message" had to be sent to traffickers in dangerous and addictive drugs that they would meet "zero tolerance" and severe penalties from the courts.

Turning to Paterson - whose sentence, just under the 26 years given to Tyrrell earlier this year, is thought to be one of the longest passed on a woman drug smuggler in Britain - the judge said she played a "very prominent, if not pivotal" role in the enterprise, despite being in a relationship with a "highly manipulative" criminal who was prepared to go to "any lengths" to achieve his aims, the fact remained she was his "dedicated ally".

Turning to Fillingham, the judge said that he too played a vital part.

As someone with previous convictions for international drug trafficking, he was a "Mr Fix It, a doer", and not merely a foot soldier, and was essential to what went on.

Assistant Chief Investigation Officer for Customs and Excise, Jim Fitzpatrick, said: "This gang tried to smuggle a huge quantity of cocaine into the UK and have received jail terms that reflect the seriousness of their crimes.

"We will now ensure that we go after every penny we can identify that has been made from their drugs trafficking.

"The excellent co-operation between staff at Customs and Excise and the National Crime Squad has ensured that an international drug smuggling gang has been broken up and the drugs are off the streets of the United Kingdom.

"Class A drugs not only have the potential to destroy the lives of those who buy them and their loved ones, but also to those who traffick in them, as can be seen from the severity of the sentences passed today."

APOLOGETIC DRUGS BARON ORDERED TO PAY UP

One of Britain's most notorious drug barons apologised for "all the trouble" he had caused as he was stripped of his wealth today.

Michael Tyrrell, serving 26 years for smuggling a record £100 million cocaine consignment into the country, was given up to 15 months to hand over nearly £280,000.

The one-time international playboy, who amassed a substantial property empire either side of the Atlantic, was warned he could look forward to a further three years behind bars if he failed to pay.

The self-styled "First White Rastafarian of Antigua", described as "once so arrogant he could never have imagined being caught", was jailed in 2002 and looked resigned as Judge William Kennedy detailed the financial consequences of his life of crime.

London's Snaresbrook Crown Court heard his roll call of ill-gotten gains included his plush £850,000 home next to the historic Rufus Stone in Brook, Hampshire. The former public schoolboy paid cash for the place after becoming fascinated with Sir Walter Tyrrell's accidental hunting trip death at the hands of King Rufus the Red.

Further down the list was his gang's luxury seafront £757,000 headquarters near Ventnor, Isle of Wight. It was built as a customs base in 1850 to catch smugglers and is one of only a handful of properties in Britain boasting a private beach.

In addition, he had a £744,000 villa in Antigua as well as a ferry he had been building on the Caribbean island which, together with other equipment, was valued at £5,000.

The court also heard of £11,000 of gold coins, as well as many hundreds of thousands of pounds transferred to his wife and channelled through one of his own accounts.

Following lengthy legal discussions, an agreed benefit figure of just under £1.9 million was reached but, because of legal fees and part ownership issues, his realisable assets were fixed at a fraction of that.

Following the ruling, Tyrrell, 57 - branded at his trial "vain, self-interested, arrogant, greedy, manipulative and ruthless" - then surprised the court. Given permission to make a short address from the dock, he began: "I really just wanted to apologise to the court and everybody for causing all this trouble and even to (trial) Judge King and (prosecutor) Miss (Tracy) Ayling even and, of course, my family.

"I am truly ashamed of being convicted of being involved in cocaine.

"If I ever do get out of this place alive, I will not do it again."

After insisting he had no hidden assets, the father-of-three went on: "Part of the reason I did not plead guilty at the outset was because I wanted to support my children for as long as possible.

He then added: "I'm now going to settle down and write my book and I might even be able to pay back customs out of the proceeds."

Before he was led back to the cells, he was allowed a few minutes to "say goodbye" to his 83-year-old mother, Pamela, after defence barrister, Simon Farrell QC, told the court his client feared he "might never see her again as a free man".

Today's ruling was the latest in a six-year saga of surveillance and court hearings that saw the eight-strong gang handed sentences totalling 143 years and a string of six-figure confiscation orders.

Apart from Tyrrell, those jailed included his money laundering common law wife, Jill Fuller - a close friend of former James Bond star Timothy Dalton - who got four-and-a-half years, and his former lover and "right hand man", Julie Paterson, nicknamed the "Cocaine Queen of the Caribbean" (24 years).

The court heard how the drug baron, who holds joint UK and Antiguan nationality, had twice been arrested for cannabis smuggling - once to Guadeloupe, where he was jailed for 12 months, and then to Britain, when he skipped bail.

In 2000, customs along with the National Crime Squad once more became interested in his activities.

Operation Eyefull saw months of intensive surveillance as he and other members of the gang painstakingly put together a 396kg (873lbs) transatlantic cocaine run they hoped would fund an idyllic retirement with multimillion pound "pensions".

The idea was to land 20 bales of the highly addictive narcotic from drug cartels in Venezuela and Colombia at Orchard Bay and then distribute it throughout Britain, with some possibly going to France.

In September that year, the consignment was collected from the island of Bequia, near St Vincent, and loaded aboard a yacht called the Blue Hen for the start of a 32-day voyage.

Everything went well until October 23, when they reached the Isle of Wight and promptly ran into a storm.

Minutes after they had started ferrying the drugs ashore in a dinghy, the gang's hopes of huge wealth began to founder in a near comic farce of mountainous seas, mechanical failure and extreme misery.

First, the craft's engine failed, forcing them to land the precious cargo at a different beach nearly a mile away.

When an incandescent Tyrrell learned what had happened, he and several of the others were left with no choice but to spend hours manhandling the 20kg bales along a treacherous cliff-top path at night.

It left them wet, cold, miserable and exhausted.

Then, just when they thought things could not get any worse, customs and police officers - who had been tracking their every step - moved in.

They seized all but one of the smugglers. He was almost relieved when they found him the next day hiding in nearby woods, half frozen, desperately hungry and completely soaked.

£90m COCAINE SMUGGLERS FOUND GUILTY

A gang of drug smugglers are facing heavy jail sentences after being found guilty today of sailing a £90 million cocaine consignment into Britain.

When they are dealt with next month, it will mark the end of a saga that saw intricate planning, visions of huge wealth, colourful language and cliff top antics.

Customs men who had spent months trailing the operation's 54-year-old mastermind, Michael Tyrrell, leapt from their undergrowth hideouts and arrested the gang.

Bale upon bale of the drugs - bound for towns and cities across the country - were seized, London's Snaresbrook Crown Court was told.

So, too, was an inflatable dinghy for inshore work, and the ocean-going yacht used to bring the 396kg haul from the Caribbean to the Isle of Wight's Orchard Bay.

Only one of those detained pleaded guilty to the cocaine smuggling charge they all faced. The rest denied the charge during their six-month trial before a jury of half a dozen women and five men.

His 15-day witness box stint featured repeated assertions that a Colombian drugs baron threatened to kill his mother if he did not do as he was told. He also warned jurors he faced 30 years in prison if they did not believe him.

US national "Captain" Didier Le Brun, 49, from Fort Lauderdale, Florida, and one of three who crewed the yacht across the Atlantic, said he first thought he was smuggling cannabis, but when he learned the truth was too scared to do anything but "go with the flow".

The court heard he arranged the 50,000 US dollar (#35,000) purchase of the Blue Hen, a battered 37ft single masted vessel he was told he could keep - along with a 200,000 US dollar (#140,000) pay packet - once he had used it to sail the cocaine to Britain.

After extensive work to make it shipshape he was joined by a couple of accomplices for an exhausting four-and-a-half week ocean crossing.

They were Laurent Penchef, 32, a dual US-French national of no fixed address - who also blamed duress - and a Colombian called German Henao, 48, the only one to plead guilty.

The last of those on trial was another American national, Robert Kavanagh, 55, who despite being officially unemployed, was the owner of a palatial Caribbean hideaway on the palm-fringed, crime-free island of St Barthelemy.

He had insisted he was an innocent house guest of Tyrrell's, and had gone looking for his good friend Henao. Unfortunately, he found him hiding up a tree and had just climbed up to find out why when customs men swooped.

None of those convicted by the jury showed any reaction as the unanimous verdicts were delivered following five days' deliberations.

The jury heard that British born Tyrrell was essentially a product of Antigua after his parents settled there in his early childhood. He was divorced, had a common-law wife, healthy bank account, four houses on a hill and a brace of upmarket cars.

In 1996 he brought his family to Britain and treated them to a new luxury £900,000 home at Brook in the New Forest.

Four years later, when almost certainly hunting for an operational base for his cocaine smuggling he spied an extensive sea-front construction at Orchard Bay on the Isle of Wight.

He was so keen to have it he gazumped another would-be owner with a £7,000 "top" on the £650,000 asking price.

But as one of the country's few private residences boasting its own beach, it was really a drug-runner's dream, and money well spent.

He may well have reasoned that few would suspect a cocaine headquarters which was not only next door to the island's smuggling museum, but in a building that began life 150 years earlier as a purpose built base in the battle against smugglers.

Customs men learnt something was afoot in July, 2000, and a joint investigation - Operation Eyefull - swung into action with Britain's National Crime Squad.

Tyrrell, who had been making frequent trips back to Antigua, was kept under close surveillance whenever he was in Britain.

Over the months he bought a string of equipment for his enterprise, and on one occasion was trailed satellite phone shopping at the Spy Shop and the Counter Spy Shop in London's Mayfair.

Finally, in mid-September, 2000, the Blue Hen passed off with Le Brun, Penchef and Henao. First port of call was the island of Bequia, near St Vincent, where it is believed the Colombian-produced drugs were loaded.

Next stop was the Isle of Wight, 32 days distant. They arrived offshore on October 22.

With the weather worsening, the 20 large cocaine bales were loaded into the yacht's 12ft inflatable. Then, with Le Brun remaining behind, the other two headed for Orchard Bay.

Halfway there their outboard died, leaving them helpless as the winds and waves made them miss the house by more than half a mile.

They finally beached at Woody Bay, abandoned the massive cocaine fortune on the sand and began a treacherous pitch-dark, clifftop slog to base, where the rest of the gang awaited.

But worried by the lack of news, Le Brun ignored orders and sailed towards the house. Furious at being disobeyed, Tyrrell promptly climbed into a small dinghy and rowed out to tell him in four letter terms to turn round and head for the horizon.

As he got back, a footsore, gorse-slashed Penchef and Henao arrived - and promptly sent him ballistic with a description of the drugs all alone somewhere along the coast.

The once sophisticated operation, already fraying at the edges, then began to resemble and Ealing comedy script as a hunt-the-drugs expedition set off in the rowing boat.

As soon as Henao and Penchef recognised Woody Bay, they dived into the freezing waters and swam ashore - not so much to secure the cocaine, but to appease the horribly foul-tempered Tyrrell.

With the outboard still out of action it left only one way to get the drugs to the house - brute strength, considerable cursing, and repeated death-defying stumblings along a narrow, pitch black, windswept, rain-lashed cliff path, regarded as dangerous even in daylight.

It took hours for the gang to carry back just six bales. Penchef then got the engine going and the next six went by inflatable.

But then Tyrrell called a halt. Fed up with first playing mountain goat and then navigating roller-coaster swells, he loaded the bales he had on to a van, apparently planning to drive to where the final eight still languished behind some Woody Bay bushes.

However, he had barely started the engine when customs men pounced. All but Penchef were quickly arrested, and he was found the next day a few hundred yards away, wet, cold, hungry and almost pleased it was all over. Le Brun was detained on the Blue Hen.In the months that followed a massive evidence gathering exercise began - with input from US coastguards and half the police forces in the Caribbean - to build up a detailed picture of the gang's island-hopping preparations for the record breaking drugs run.

Outside court Jim Fitzpatrick, assistant chief Customs investigation officer, said: "We are absolutely delighted with these verdicts. We have disrupted and dismantled a very sophisticated international drugs trafficking organisation capable of bringing in vast amounts of cocaine into the country."

He said the amount seized represented one and a half million street deals, and added: "By getting this cocaine we hope we have minimised the harm these drugs cause, not only in terms of people's health but the crime that goes hand in hand with them."

HOW SMUGGLERS' PARTNERSHIP RAN AGROUND

The criminal partnership of cocaine smugglers Julie Paterson and her lover Michael Tyrrell started on the white beaches of Antigua and ended on the rainswept cliffs of England.

The two-month trial heard that Norwich-born Paterson, 46, a highly-regarded yachtswoman with three Atlantic crossings to her credit, ran a successful boat charter business in Antigua.

Father-of-three Tyrrell, 55, who grew up on the palm-fringed island, met her in 1994, when he sold her a house.

Not long afterwards the pair embarked on a passionate affair.

Tyrrell's common-law wife Jill Fuller - currently serving four years for laundering £1 million of his ill-gotten gains - was unaware of the relationship.

The romance was still going strong years later when the ageing playboy, with previous convictions for cannabis smuggling, began plotting the record-breaking cocaine run to Britain.

Paterson, who was to become known by some as the "Cocaine Queen of the Caribbean", held the operation's purse strings, and looked after the Antiguan end, while her lover arranged matters in Britain.

Among other things, he bought the ideal smuggler's headquarters - a luxurious seafront development at Orchard Bay - for £657,000.

Apart from boasting a private beach, it was next door to the island's smuggling museum, and 150 years earlier had been used as a base in the battle against smugglers.

Customs learned something was afoot in July 2000, and a joint investigation - Operation Eyefull - was launched with the National Crime Squad.

Tyrrell and Paterson were subsequently kept under close surveillance whenever they were in the UK, and tailed as they bought a wide range of equipment for the operation.

They were even followed visiting the Spy Shop and the Counter Spy Shop in London's Mayfair.

Some of their conversations were also tape-recorded.

Once Fillingham was heard telling Paterson: "That's what I love about you. You are so attentive to all the details."

Meanwhile, a battered 37-foot yacht called the Blue Hen had been bought in the Caribbean for 50,000 dollars, repaired, and readied for the 3,500 mile journey to Britain.

In September 2000, it cast off with a three-strong crew, collected the drugs from Bequia, an island near St Vincent, and headed for the Isle of Wight.

They arrived on October 22.

With the weather worsening, the 20 large cocaine bales were loaded into the yacht's 12 foot inflatable. One of the men remained aboard while the others headed for Orchard Bay.

Halfway there the outboard died, forcing them to land at Woody Bay half a mile off course.

They had no choice but to abandon their massive consignment on the beach and begin a treacherous night-time, cliff-top slog to base, where the rest of the gang waited.

Meanwhile, the smuggler left on the Blue Hen became worried by the lack of news, ignored orders and sailed for the gang's beach headquarters, only for a furious Tyrrell to row out and order him in four letter terms to head for the horizon.

The other two then arrived and left him fuming at news of the huge drugs fortune left alone somewhere along the coast.

The once-sophisticated operation, by now badly fraying at the edges, began to resemble an Ealing comedy as they piled into the rowing boat and set off to look for it.

After some time, they found the haul, and then spent hours trying to carry it to the house along the narrow path regarded as dangerous even in daylight.

It took what was left of the night to stumble back with just six bales of cocaine.

One gang member then managed to repair the outboard and the next six went by inflatable.

But with dawn approaching, Tyrrell decided to throw caution to the wind and try to collect the final eight by van.

He had barely started the engine when Customs men pounced.

Six were arrested on shore, and the seventh aboard the yacht.

Most of them were dealt with earlier this year. Today's sentences bring the jail term total passed on the gang members to 141 years.

A woman received one of the longest jail sentences ever handed down to a female drugs trafficker. Julie Patterson was jailed for 24 years and Frederic Fillingham received a jail term of 18 years for their part in an attempt to smuggle 400 kgs of almost all pure cocaine, with a street value of GBP 90 million, by yacht to the Isle of Wight from the southern Caribbean Island Bequia.

Julie Anne Paterson, (46) British, living in Parham, Antigua but originally from Norfolk, was actively involved in preparing the 'Blue Hen' Yacht for sail and used her sailing skills to brief the crew on use of navigational equipment and landing sites. She is the former girlfriend of Michael Tyrell who was sentenced in March 2002 to 26 years for his part in organising the importation attempt. Paterson was a member of the party observed by Customs officers waiting for the drugs to arrive on the Isle of Wight beach. beach.

Frederic Fillingham, (43) American, from Fort Lauderdale, Florida, USA sentenced to 18 years. Fillingham was on the run from the US authorities for violating his 15-year parole having been convicted for drug smuggling. As well as recruiting others as crew, he used his boat building skills to make the boat used, the Blue Hen, fit for the transatlantic voyage. Paterson and Fillingham were found hiding together in the grounds of a local holiday complex and arrested by Customs Officers in the early hours of 23 October 2000.

These convictions mean all of the eight people arrested in October 2000 as part of Customs and Excise Law Enforcement Operation 'Eyeful' have been jailed and brings the combined prison sentence to 145 years. It also brings an end to prosecutions brought as a result of this operation.

The conviction of Paterson and Fillingham follow the earlier convictions of Michael Tyrell, Robert Kavanagh, Dider Lebrun, Laurent Penchef and German Henao in March 2002 all for drugs trafficking offences and that of Jill Fuller in April 2002, the wife of Michael Tyrell, for money laundering offences.

Assistant Chief Investigation Officer for Customs and Excise, Jim Fitzpatrick said: "This gang tried to smuggle a huge quantity of cocaine into the UK and have received jail terms that reflect the seriousness of their crimes. We will now ensure that we go after every penny we can identify has been made from their drugs trafficking.

"The excellent co-operation between staff at Customs and Excise and the National Crime Squad has ensured that an international drug smuggling gang has been broken up and the drugs are off the streets of the United Kingdom.

"Class A drugs not only have the potential to destroy the lives of those who buy them and their loved ones, but also to those who traffick in them, as can be seen from the severity of the sentences passed today."

NOTES TO EDITORS

1. The defendants were arrested in the early hours of the morning on 23 October 2000 following an intensive three-month surveillance operation on the principal Michael Tyrrell. In December 1999, Tyrrell purchased Orchard Bay House near Ventnor on the Isle of Wight. This is one of the only properties in the country to have a private beach and was purchased by Tyrrell with the intention of using it to land the drugs.

The operation code-named "Eyeful" culminated as officers awaited the arrival of the yacht 'Blue Hen' from the Caribbean. Ironically after over a 3000 mile, 32-day Atlantic crossing the operation took an unexpected twist. The yacht crew launched their inflatable dinghy off St Catherine's Point with the drugs on board but the engine failed.

Adverse weather conditions and strong tidal currents forced the inflatable 1 mile from its destination to land at the remote beach of Woody Bay.

As customs and police watched, the smugglers made desperate attempts to haul the consignment along the treacherous cliff path to Tyrrell's home. However Customs and police struck seizing 400 kilos of cocaine worth up to GBP 90 million, one of the largest hauls of cocaine in recent years. The investigation spanned over 14 different countries, including Europe, America and the Caribbean, helping to smash this international drugs organisation.

UK Government: £2m payback time for drug smuggler

M2 PRESSWIRE-SEPTEMBER 8, 2005-UK Government: £2m payback time for drug smuggler ©1994-2005 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

Convicted drug smuggler Michael Tyrrell was today ordered to repay nearly £2 million following a confiscation order made by Snaresbrook Crown Court. An HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC financial investigation into Tyrrell's proceeds of drug trafficking led to the identification of substantial assets in the UK and Caribbean.

Tyrrell was part of a five-man gang who attempted to smuggle 400kgs of cocaine by yacht to the Isle of Wight from the southern Caribbean island of Bequia. He was sentenced to 26 years imprisonment in March 2002 for his part in the operation.

Tyrrell's benefit from drug trafficking was assessed at £1.9 million and the order was made in this amount as the Judge ruled he had hidden assets as yet unidentified by the prosecution. His identified assets, funded by crime, included properties in the United Kingdom and Antigua, an Antiguan ferry adapted for smuggling, two high speed rigid inflatable boats and several offshore bank accounts.

Kevin Davis, Assistant Chief Investigation Officer at HMRC said:

"Today's judgment demonstrates that crime simply doesn't pay. Ensuring criminals are stripped of their ill-gotten gains is an essential element in law enforcement's fight against crime. HMRC is committed to pursuing those whose lifestyles are funded by criminal activity."

Tyrrell was arrested on 23 October 2000, following an intensive three-month joint surveillance operation by Customs and the National Crime Squad.

In December 1999, Tyrrell purchased Orchard Bay House near Ventnor on the Isle of Wight, one of few properties in the country with a private beach, which was intended as a landing place for the smuggled cocaine.

The operation, code-named "Eyefull" culminated as officers awaited the arrival of the yacht 'Blue Hen' from the Caribbean. After an Atlantic crossing of over 3000 miles lasting 32 days, the operation took an unexpected twist. The yacht crew launched their inflatable dinghy off St Catherine's Point with the drugs on board but the engine failed.

Adverse weather conditions and strong tidal currents forced the inflatable one mile from its destination to land at the remote beach of Woody Bay, on the Isle of Wight.

As Customs investigators and police watched, the smugglers made desperate attempts to haul the consignment along the treacherous cliff path to Tyrrell's home. When they struck, investigators seized 400kgs of cocaine with a street value of £90 million, one of the largest hauls of cocaine in recent years. The investigation spanned over 14 different countries, including Europe, America and the Caribbean, helping to smash this international drugs organisation.

This case was successfully handled by the newly established Revenue and Customs Prosecutions Office (RCPO). RCPO is an independent prosecuting authority which reports to the Attorney General, and is responsible for the prosecution of all HMRC cases in England and Wales.

Coroner rules out neglect of drugs lord who was handcuffed to prison officer on death bed

A CORONER has ruled out neglect into the death of a convicted drug lord who was handcuffed to a prison officer as he lay dying in a North-East hospital.

Michael Tyrrell, 65, died at the University Hospital of North Durham on May 30, 2013.

Sitting at Crook Coroner's Court this morning (March 31), Coroner Andrew Tweddle heard how a post-mortem examination revealed that there were no suspicious circumstances surrounding Tyrrell's death and that he died of natural causes caused by pneumonia as a result of advanced mouth cancer.

The pensioner had been labelled as the mastermind behind the biggest cocaine smuggling operation ever seen in the country after UK Customs and Excise seized 396 kilos of cocaine, worth about £90m, on a beach of his house, on the Isle of Wight, in 2000.

Coroner's officer, Jaqueline Sirrell, said Tyrrell was sentenced to 26 years in prison in 2002 and was serving his sentence at the high-security Frankland Prison, near Durham, when he became ill in 2012 after having several teeth removed.

He lost a significant amount of weight and was admitted to hospital in January 2013.

The father-of-three was diagnosed with cancer of the tongue in March 2013 and underwent radiotherapy and chemotherapy but was readmitted to hospital in May 2013 because he was struggling to breathe.

PC Sirrell said Tyrrell was handcuffed to a prison officer by a chain and at 5am on May 30 he went into cardiac arrest.

"During the 40 minutes they were treating him, the chain was removed for only about five minutes," she said.

Tyrrell's condition deteriorated and staff called his family.

One of his daughters arrived at 7.25am to be with him and he passed away at 9.10am.

PC Sirrell said an investigation by the Independent Prisons and Probation Ombudsman found that the care Tyrrell received was the same as he could have expected in the community, but that better communication in complex cases was needed as well looking into whether restraints were always justified.

Mr Tweddle said the family had concerns about Tyrrell's treatment and had launched their own independent legal report concerning whether Article 2 of the Human Rights Act, the right to life, had been adhered to.

Mr Tweddle said he had found that Article 2 was not "engaged" but rejected the family's request to adjourn the case while they applied for public funding to challenge it.

He said: "The appropriate conclusion is one of natural causes - I find no evidence of neglect."
