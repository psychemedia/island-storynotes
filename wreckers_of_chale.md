Such was the law of the land regarding shipwrecks. But how was the law framed and interpreted on the Island?

THE VILLAGE OF CHALE AND THE WRECKERS.

The village of 'green-swarded Chale,' with its scattered houses straggling irregularly for a mile along the road, is a place full of interest to the antiquary. It is one of the very few spots in the Isle of Wight the local name of which may be traced to a Celtic origin. In Domesday-book it is called Cela, and it may be referred to the Welsh word Celydd, which Owen Pughe defines to be 'a retreat, a woody shelter.' Celyddon, the plural of Celydd, was the name specifically given to the great forest-tract which spread from Loch Ness over the Highland wastes, and was called by the Romans Caledonia. There is some reason for believing that the woodlands on the chalk hills of the Chiltern range, which rise like rounded masses from the level of the wide and open plain, and stretch north of the Thames, were known to the Welsh by the name of Celyddon (Guest, *Orig. Celt.* vol. ii. p. 152). The derivation of the name of Chale, which Mr. Adams gives (*I. W.* p. 209) from 'Schiele,' the hollow of a cup or bowl, referring perhaps to the shape of the bay, or to the peculiar formation of the chines, is altogether fanciful. The narrow gorge of the valley of Chillerion, and Chilton Chine are probably both connected with this old Celtic word Celydd, though in their case the Anglo-Saxon word 'ton' or town has been affixed.

Chale supplies a very good specimen of the way in which parishes were formed in Enpland by the gradual result of circumstances. In ancient times its population received their religious services from the Benedictine monks of ihe Priory of Carisbrooke. So early as the reign of Henry I, a.d. 1114, Hugh de Vernun, nephew of Baldwin de Redvers, 'Lord of the Isle,' and founder of Quarr Abbey, to whom Chale belonged, finding the means of divine worship were inadequately supplied by the Carisbrooke Priory for the benefit of the people on his own domain, built a church, with a clergyman, who was paid by a charge on the estate of the lord of the manor, and whom the lord therefore presented to the benefice. In this way Chale became a parish. As this act tended to the advancement of religion, it was encouraged by the diocesan of the Isle of Wight, the Bishop of Winchester, who consecrated the place of worship thus established by Hugh de Vernun, and dedicated it to St. Andrew. The bishop also consented that the minister or incumbent should be resident in Chale and receive for his maintenance and for the use of his church there the tithes and offerings of the inhabitants, as well as any emolument or salary the founder annexed to it. This appears from the cartulary of Carisbrooke, quoted by Worsley (*Hist. I. W.* p. 254), where William Gifford, Bishop of Winchester, confirms an agreement made between the church of St. Mary of Carisbrooke, the minister of that church, and Hugh de Vernun, founder of the church of St. Andrew at Chale, on the day of the dedication of that church. The parson of Carisbrooke claimed the church of Chale as belonging to his parish; whereas Hugh de Vernun maintained that his tenants did not belong to the church of Carisbrooke, but by ancient usage could go to what church they pleased while living and bury their dead with equal liberty. In order however to terminate all animosity, he assigned to the church of Carisbrooke a moiety of the glebe land and tithes of burials and oblations, excepting those of his own house, which he reserved entire for maintaining the service and repairs of the church of Chale. The parson of Chale was bound to perform the whole service of his church; and on these conditions the parson of Carisbrooke testified his consent to the new church having a burying-ground. The parish of Chale was in this way entirely a lay-foundation, though the bishop signified his agreement by a legal instrument. In a church like that of Chale privately founded the two points upon which stress was mainly laid were (1) that it should be under the bishop's control; (2) that it should be sufficiently endowed. There was little fear that one belonging to the great family of De Redvers, who were generous benefactors of the church, would be guilty of meanness. Although no trace of Hugh de Vernun's original building remains, the church standing in a position singularly bleak and naked attests the pious founder's liberality.

'The outline of the church,' Mr. Venables says (*Guide I. W.* p. 281), 'is low and heavy. The perpendicular tower is very good — probably the work of the same architect with those of Carisbrooke and Gatcombe ... The plan is that so common in the island of two equal bodies with no constructional chancel.'

At Chale still lingers a relic of a curious feature of life in the Middle Ages, On St. Catherine's Down, 769 feet above the sea, there is undoubted evidence showing that in the fourteenth century a hermit had taken up his residence on the summit. A hermit was a religious personage who, without becoming a member of a monastic community, kept aloof from society. The hermit was a solitary in a cell, as distinguished from an anchorite, who was a solitary without any fixed dwelling-place. There is record in the registers of the Bishop of Winchester of the admission of one Walter Langstrell 'to the hermitage on the Down of Chale,' in October, 1312. Eleven years afterwards, in 1323, it appears from the same register that a chapel was erected on the spot by Walter de Godyton, who added an endowment for a chantry priest to sing masses for the soul of the founder and the souls of his ancestors, as also to provide lights at night to warn off ships from approaching too near this dangerous coast. The abode of this chantry-priest was nothing more than a half-timbered hut, containing two rooms, with no fireplace beyond a space of ground on which he burnt some dried turf, and with no chimney except a hole in the roof. At the Reformation, when some of the wheat was pulled up with the tares by the rude and ruthless hands of those who took part in that purifying but destructive process, the lights in this humble hermitage were put out, when the masses were forbidden. The chapel and the hermitage have entirely disappeared, but in 1753 their foundations were excavated by Sir Richard Worsley, and are. Canon Venables says, still to be traced. Worsley (*Hist. I. W.* p. 247) has a note which states that in the family papers 'is a small rude drawing of this chapel, when entire, from which it appears that it had only a body without a transept; the tower stood at the west end. A description of this tower, with four views of it in its decayed state, is seen in the *Gentleman's Magazine*, vol. xxvii. p. 176.

With the destruction of the chantry, the morals of the people of Chale, as regarded the treatment of shipwrecked marmers, became worse rather than better. Tomkins, in his *Tour in the Isle of Wight* (London, i 796), vol. i. p. 126, having described how, in his voyage round the island, 'they stood out in the channel to avoid the lurking rocks which abound in Chale Bay,' adds, 'Here our sailors told us of an inhuman stratagem said to have been practised on this coast for a number of years, but it has too much the air of fiction and improbability to be seriously credited. On every stormy night the inhabitants of the coast of Chale are said to have allured the unwary mariner to his destruction by fixing a lanthorn to the head of an old horse, one of whose forelegs had been previously tied up. The limping gait of the animal gave the lanthorn a kind of motion exactly similar to that of a ship's lanthorn, and led the deceived pilot on these fatal rocks, a prey to merciless plunderers, who it was said would not even scruple to dispatch any unfortunate individual that survived the wreck, in order to secure their booty more completely.'

Dreadful traditions of such barbarous contrivances as that mentioned by Tomkins still linger on other coasts besides that of the back of the Isle of Wight. The history of wrecking, as told by the different legislative enactments which have been passed to prevent this savage custom, is a dismal chapter in the records of human greediness and cruelty. 'Wreck,' so writes Blackstone in his *Commentaries*, book iv. part i, chap. vii. 'by the ancient common law, was where any ship was lost at sea and the goods and cargo were thrown upon the land, in which case these goods so wrecked were adjudged to belong to the king, for it was held that by the loss of the ship all properly was gone out of the original owner.' This revenue of wrecks was frequently granted out to lords of manors as a royal franchise. The lords of the Isle of Wight had this privilege, and thus in the 8th of Edward I we read that when Isabella de Fortibus was called upon before the Justices Itinerant to answer respecting the peculiar extent and nature of her dominion in the island she was, among other demands in the language of the Pleadings 'summoned to show to the lord the king by what warrant she claimed to have wreck of the sea.' And so also, according to Worsley (*Hist. I. W.* p. 245), when Sir Thomas Langford leased out the manor of Chale, reservation was made in this lease of wards, marriages, reliefs, escheats, wrecks of the sea, with the advowson of the church of Chale. In order to constitute a legal wreck, the goods must come to land. If they continue at sea, the law distinguishes them by the uncouth terms of 'jetsam,' 'flotsam,' and 'ligan.' Jetsam is where goods are cast into the sea, and there sink and remain under water; flotsam is where they continue swimming on the surface of the waves; ligan where they are sunk in the sea, but tied to a cork or buoy, in order to be found again. These are also the Crown's if no owner appears to claim them; but if any owner appears he is entitled to recover the possession.

Henry I, whose declining years were saddened by the loss of his son, William of Normandy, and two of the king's illegitimate children through shipwreck, a.d. 1120, was moved so far as to ordain that if any person escaped alive out of the ship it should be no wreck. Henry II made a feeble enlargement of this scant mercy, and by his charter declared that if on the coasts of either England, Poitou, Oleron, or Gascony, any ship should be distressed, and either man or beast escape or be found thereon alive, the goods should remain to the owners if they claimed them within three months, but otherwise should be esteemed a wreck and belong to the king, or other lord of the franchise. This was again improved by Richard I, and the law as laid down by Bracton in the reign of Henry III was a still further improvement. In A. D. 1275, when at the Parliament held at Westminster several reformatory statutes were issued, further progress was made in the maritime law relating to wrecks and wreckage. In a. d. 1257, when under Edward III, who has been called the father of English commerce, the staple was regulated by statute, and the five great commodities of the kingdom were allowed to be dealt in for exportation only by a corporation called the merchants of the staple and in certain specified towns where they were disposed of to foreigners, it was also enacted that if any ship be lost on the shore and the goods come to land (which cannot, says the statute, be called a wreck) they shall presently be delivered to the merchants, paying only a reasonable reward to those that saved and preserved them, which shall be called 'salvage.'

In spite of all this legislation the barbarous practice of wrecking prevailed to the disgrace of the population on our sea-coasts. The fate of a vessel near in shore and driving before a gale with people on board likely to perish ought to touch every human heart in one way only; but in place of creating a feeling of sympathy with the sufferers, it put the seafaring population on the Isle of Wight and elsewhere upon calculations of their own profit from the sad catastrophe.

Often in remote times has an unfortunate crew been seduced to its fate upon the rocks in thick weather, and then not seldom have the master, the mate, and the sailors, too few and too feeble to fight for their lives, escaping from the breakers, been hurried to their end by the bludgeons of the wreckers. Dead men tell no tales and claim no property. Instances have occurred when some fearful old woman has been known to kneel upon the chest of a sailor who had been dragged upon the beach out of the way of the surf and covering his mouth with her cloak carry off his money which he wore about his person. Not only tradition has handed down these atrocities; there is more trustworthy evidence that such things were done even towards the end of the last century. The preamble of an Act of Parliament is generally the summary of the arguments for the necessity of the Bill. The preamble of a Bill for the repression of crime may therefore be taken as the expression of the national conviction that such crimes exist at the time. In the reign of George II a new Act was passed which recited — 'That notwithstanding the good and salutary laws now in being against plundering and destroying vessels in distress, and against taking away shipwrecked, lost, and stranded goods, still many wicked enormities had been practised to the disgrace of the nation.' Therefore certain provisions were enacted to the effect that death was to be the punishment for hanging out false lights; also for those who killed or prevented the escape of shipwrecked persons; also for stealing goods from a wreck, whether there be any living creature on board or not. Acts of Parliament in following years showed the impress of the more merciful spirit of legislation which began to prevail. The punishment of theft from a wreck was reduced to imprisonment, while penal servitude for life was made the penalty for a new development of crime, the wilfully scuttling or setting on fire or wrecking a ship for the purpose of defrauding insurance offices or owners.

Upon our coasts, even at the beginning of this century, this plea for plundering a wrecked vessel was put forward, that it was done only at the expense of the underwriters, who, it was urged, made enormous profits in their business by calculating on these chances and squaring their rales of insurance accordingly. Such sophistical arguments come easily enough from the lips of those who saw no harm in smuggling, and thought it no sin to cheat the revenue.

The lifeboat movement has contributed greatly towards bringing about an improvement in the tone of public opinion. The flashing lights from the lifeboat stations tell of coming rescue to the homeward-bound ship, which has come suddenly to destruction on our dangerous coast, instead of luring it on to be the prey of wreckers. The mission of the gallant crews of the lifeboat is to save life, and their courage is glorified by mercy. There are still, as of old, keen eyes watching the signs of the coming storm, as they see in the dim distance the struggling ship making towards the land, but those eyes are not lighted up with the greed of the vulture watching for its prey; hardy resolute men are on the look-out, eagerly watching the labouring vessel from the shore, and preparing to launch the lifeboat, should the necessity arise. Let all honour be paid to the branch of the Lifeboat Institution which has been established in this Island, but do not let us forget Walter de Godyton and his primitive lighthouse on St. Catherine's Down, nor the solitary chantry priest kindling the lamp, whose faint gleams were in old days blessed by the anxious mariner. None of the excitement which stirs the heart of the coxswain and his crew in the lifeboat was felt in the bleak abode of that man of God; he had sacrificed everything on earth which most of us hold dear; a drearier life we cannot conceive; let us not then grudge the due meed of honour and of respect to this lonely watcher o'er the deep, as night after night he lit his beacon, and bent his knee in prayer for 'those in danger of the sea.'

TO DO


```{admonition} An unenviable notoriety, 1911
:class: dropdown

In John L. Whitehead's *The Undercliff Of The Isle Of Wight Past And Present*, 1911, Chapter XII, [p331-334](https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.502008/page/n443/mode/2up).


The manor of Godyton is found under its modern name of "Gotten," as a farm situated on the north-east slope of Chale Down. In 1780 the Trinity Board, recognising the value of the ancient tower as a landmark, and desiring to re-establish the light, substantially repaired the tower, and, at an expense of £7,000, erected another pharos by its side. This light was soon found to be useless in bad weather when most wanted, for the high hills are almost always enveloped in clouds, and of course the lanthorns invisible at any little distance. Pennant, from whom the quotation is taken, mentions that "From mistaking this light for the Portland lights, a Dutch frigate of 36 guns and 250 men came bump ashore and was beat to pieces, and though most of the crew were saved at last, the surf ran so high it was one night and two days before they could be brought off." "I was," he adds, "the means of saving eight men, by bribing a desperate smuggler to go off to them in his boat." `[Pennants, Journey to the I. W., vol. ii, p. 189.]`

In bygone days the south side of the island obtained an unenviable notoriety from the behaviour on these occasions of the people living on the coast strip. The ingenious Mr. J. Sturch, of Newport, writing on the Isle of Wight in 1756, says:—

"The Country People, of the meaner Sort, have for many years been too much accustomed to make a barbarous Advantage of these Misfortunes, plundering and carrying off the Merchants Effects in a most unjust and infamous Manner," adding — "of late this savage Practice has been much suppressed." `[The General Magazine of Arts and Sciences, p. 122.]`

Albin, writing in 1795, tells us "The inhabitants are usually more intent on plundering than on affording assistance to the distressed and shipwrecked mariner." A year later, Tomkins, in his *Tour of the Island*, refers "to an inhuman stratagem practised by the inhabitants of Chale" — adding that it has too much the air of fiction to be seriously credited — "on every stormy night the unwary mariner is allured to his destruction by fixing a lantern to the head of an old horse, one of whose legs had been previously tied up. The limping gait of the animal gave the lantern a kind of motion, exactly similar to that of a ship's light, and led the deceived pilot on these fatal rocks, to fall a prey to merciless plunderers."

In consequence of this atrocious behaviour — whether here or elsewhere — it was enacted in the reign of George II "That death was to be the punishment for hanging out false lights, also for stealing goods from a wreck."

Behaviour of this kind could not have been notorious here, or very general, since we find Gilpin, in 1798, writing:— "There is another picturesque circumstance frequently seen on the coasts of the Isle of Wight, which may be mentioned, though it is a dreadful one. A winter seldom passes in which the inhabitants of these dangerous coasts are not called together to see some dreadful event (a wreck) of this kind. Long experience has taught them to judge when the mischief is inevitable. They see that every wave which beats over the perishing vessel drives her nearer some reef of rocks, well known to them, though the seaman knows it not; signals can be of no use; yet they make what signals they can to point out the danger. In a short moment the dreadful crash arrives. The labouring vessel, now beating among the rocks, gives way in every part, and the hospitable islanders, very unlike their neighbours on the Cornish Coast, have nothing left but to do everything in their power to save the miserable people, and recover what they can from the wreck."

From the earliest period "wreck of the sea, waifs and estrays," pertained to the lordship of the island. At an inquisition taken on the death of Baldwin de Redvers, 47 Henry III (1263), "the jurors also say that wreck of the sea belonging to the lord of the castle is worth 4s. per annum." During the countess Isabella's tenure the claim was contested by the abbot of Quarr, by John de Insula, owning Bonchurch and other Undercliff estates, by Sir Thomas de Aula, of St. Lawrence, and the lady Matilda de Estur, of Old Park, in Whitwell parish, on the plea that each of them was entitled to one-half of whatever should be wrecked on their respective lands, as a compensation or salvage for preserving the other half for the use of the lord." The trial took place before the Justices Itinerant, at Winchester, 8 Edward I (1280), when "Isabella, countess of Albermarl, was summoned to show to the Lord the King, by what warrant she thus claimed to have wreck of the sea, and Isabella comes and saith that she and all her ancestors, from the time of king Richard, and also before that time always unto the present time have had their wreck of the sea in her fee of the Isle of Wight without any interruption." The story is given in Hillier's unfinished *History of the Isle of Wight*, and "The jury being chosen, say upon oath, 'that the aforesaid Countess and also all her ancestors, from the time whereof memory doth not exist, had such wreck of sea in her fee,' etc., and by an order of the Itinerant Justices the rights of the Countess were confirmed. `[Hillier, Hist. and Antiq, I. W., pt. ii, p. 95.]`

In 1416, 3 Henry V, is entered the following:—

"Edwardus Dux Ebor'.

Insula de Wight et Caresbrok Castr' infra eundem et totum dominium addict' insulam et castrum pertinens cum wrecco maris..." `[Cal. Inq., p.m., vol. iv.]`

The "revenue of wrecks" was granted as a royal franchise to lords of manors, and the Wardens of the Island claimed this privilege. Worsley writes:— "When the Lordship was in Prince Edward, Sir Henry Tyeys was Warden under him, a petition was exhibited against him to the Parliament by Ralph de Gorges (of Knighton, I. of W.), complaining that he (Sir Henry Tyeys) had defrauded the lord of part of the salvage of a wreck," etc. `[Worsley, Hist., p. 88.]` The lords of the manor of Ashey, which included the sub-manor of Knyghton, claimed to have all wrecks of the sea on the north side of the island between Ryde and Binstead, as far beyond low water mark as a man could reach the ground with an oar, 18 ft. long, as their property.

The result of the inquiry is entered on a Patent Roll:—

1320 Nov. 15 Westminster  
"Commission of Oyer and Terminer to John de Bello Campo of Somersete (and others), touching the petition, exhibited before the King's Council, of Ralph de Gorges, alleging that divers trespasses and other malpractices under colour of office had been committed as well against the King, Edward, earl of Chester and lord of the Isle of Wight, his son, as against men of the county of Southampton and of the said Island, by Henry le Tyeys and John de Burton and other ministers of the said Henry during the time the same Henry was Constable of the said Island." `[Cal. Pat. R., 1317-1321, Edw. II. p. 546.]`

And later, in the same series of Rolls, is entered:—

1321. July 2. Westminster.  
"Grant to Ralph de Gorges, lately taken prisoner while on the King's service and ransomed afterwards, of 500 marks towards his ransom, to be received out of the first money accruing from the £1000 by which Henry Tyeys lately made fine for trespasses against the King, Edward, earl of Chester, in the Isle of Wight of which he was convicted..." `[Ibid, p. 596.]`

As the commerce between the continent and the mainland increased in volume this asset must have become much more valuable. It possibly explains the effort the early manorial lords seem to have made to secure a sea-frontage on the exposed south side of the Island, however contracted the area might be.

The phrase "flotsam and jetsam" is often used, but the true meaning is not always fully understood. In order to constitute a legal wreck the goods must come to land. If they continue at sea the law distinguishes them by the above terms. "Jetsam" is applied where goods are cast into the sea, and there sink and remain under water; "flotsam," where the goods continue floating on the surface of the waves, and a third term, "ligan," where they are sunk in the sea, but tied to a cork or buoy to be found again, a mode of procedure endeared to the heart of many a bygone smuggler.

The following deed is of interest, as showing that some of the rights claimed by the "Lords of the Island" in early days still appertained to the later governorship:—

"An agreement between Richard Worsley, Captaine of the Isle of Wight, and certyn Merchaunts of London, concerning Goods wrecked on the Island, 35 Henry VIII (1544).

> This Indenture made the vijth day of March in the xxxvth year of the Reign of our Sovereigne Lord Henry 8th by the Grace of God of Ingland, Fraunce and Ireland, Kyng, Defender of the Faith and on Erth immediately under God suppreme Hed of the Church of Ingland and Ireland.

Per me Rolandu Stap. (L.S.)

Dunnose, where the disaster happened, is a well-known and dangerous point on the coast near Luccombe, and here, in recent years, several shipping disasters have occurred, notably the wreck of H.M.S. Eurydice,

From a note entered in a Calendar of State Papers it would seem attention had been drawn to the dangerous coast near by Dunnose:—

"1661. Nov. 16. Reference to the Trinity House of the Petition of Edward Penruddock, for setting up a light house on the western coast and Dunnose Point on the south of the Isle of Wight." `[Cal, S. P. Dom, Ser., 1661—1663, p. 149.]`

The foregoing "Notes" may very fitly conclude with a brief description of the well-known lighthouse situated at St. Catherine's Point, in the parish of Niton.

ST. CATHERINE'S LIGHTHOUSE

After the primitive light disappeared in consequence of the chantry endowments having been taken away in the reign of Henry VIII, no further attempt to lessen the dangers of navigation was made until the year 1780. In this year the Brethren of the Trinity House erected a lighthouse on the top of the down near to the western boundary of the parish of Niton. This, however, proved useless on account of the misty vapours which so frequently obscured the summit of the hill, when the mariners had most need of the lights' friendly aid.
