# A Second Contested Wreck

The shenanigans regarding wrecks and the claims arising from them appears not to have been an isolated incident.

As Simon's *The History of the Wine Trade in England*, described, just a few years later there was another delivery of "distressed wine" to the shores of the back of the Wight, this time carried away by *"John de Presford and others"*.

> On November 22nd, 1318, for instance, a complaint was lodged by Martin de Bek, merchant of *Oporto in Portugal* (*Tortus de Portynggale*) and his fellow merchants of the same place, that whereas they had laden a ship, called the *Ship of Jesus Christ of Oporto* (*navis Jehsu Christi de Portu*) in that port with goods for conveyance to England, and the ship was driven ashore at Brighteston, in the Isle of Wight, their merchandise was carried away by John de Presford and others. `[Calend. of Pat.
