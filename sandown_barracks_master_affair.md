BARRACK PAPERS.

*Lord Henry Petty* observed, that before he proceeded to the statement of the business of which he had given notice, he trusted the House would indulge him with their attention for a few moments, while he said something respecting what had lately passed in the House concerning the Barrack Department. It would be in the recollection of the House that when the Hon. Gentleman behind (Mr. Robson) brought forward some motions on that subject, of them had been agreed to, while the previous question had been moved and carried with respect to the others. This had been done in the absence of all explanation, as to the object which the Hon. Gentleman had in view, that was intelligible to him, or, he believed, that could be intelligible to any person in the House. He had moved the previous question with a view to induce the Hon. Gentleman to come forward with the necessary information, and also with the intention, in case he should still refuse, to examine into the business himself, and find it out with or without his assistance. He now flattered himself that he had discovered the object of these motions. He found that they related to transactions which took place in 1805, respecting the barns hired as barracks in the division of Sandown Bay, in the Isle of Wight, which were paid for at a very extravagant rate, when a building for Barracks was offered at a much more reasonable expence. He would, therefore, under these circumstances, move all the motions of the Hon. Gentleman, respecting which the previous question had been before carried, and also add a new motion, which would relate to the Barrack Master, who, it appeared, had hired these barns at an extravagant rent, and made an improper report with regard to the building offered as a Barrack. It was right that he should be called upon to explain his conduct with respect to this transaction. He concluded by moving for Copies of the Letters from Mr. Day, of Brading in the Isle of Wight, to the Barrack Master of the Sandown Bay Division, and to the Secretary at War, respecting the building of a Barrack at Brading, with the answers to them, if any; and a list of the Barns hired as Barracks. In addition to these which had been previously called for, he moved for a Copy of the Report that had been made by Major Davies, the Barrack Master, relative to the proposals of Mr. Day for building a Barrack at Brading. 

The motions of Lord H. Petty were carried.

*Tuesday, July 1.*

...

*The Secretary at War* moved, "that there be laid before the House copies of several Letters and Correspondence between the Barrack Master General and Major Davies, of Highbury Barracks, the Isle Wight, respecting the hiring of barns, and other out-houses, for the purposes of barracks; respecting the misconduct of the Barrack Master of Sandown and the Letter from the Secretary at War, of the February, for the dismissal of the said Barrack Master;" which were agreed to, and afterwards presented, and ordered to lie on the table, and to be printed.

*Mr. Robson* moved for a copy of the Letter of James Pritchard, Barrack Master Sandown, in the Isle of Wight dated the 20th of January, 1806, relative the glaring peculation in the Barrack Department.

*The Secretary at War* wished to have the last words omitted, as it would imply admission of peculations which had not been proved ; which suggestion, well as the motion, was agreed to.

BARRACK ABUSES.

The Letter of which the following is a copy, accompanied the Affidavits, transmitted to the Secretary at War, by Mr. Atkins, which affidavits will be found in the foregoing Number, at page 206.—The Letter, like the affidavits, was laid_ before parliament, and afterwards printed, upon the motion of Mr. Robson.

*Copy of a Letter from Barrack Master Atkins late of Sandown Barracks, to the Secretary at War; dated 29th June, 1806. — Dated, No. 2, Margaret-street, Cavendish Square, June 29, 1806.*

Sir,—Haviing obtained the printed papers called for by the House of Commons, I hasten to vindicate myself from the charges laid against me, and, by one connected chain of circumstances, to prove the malignity of Major Davis. It was always the liberal practice of the Barrack-Master-General, to forward to the person against whom an accusation was made, the charges themselves, in order to enabie him to make his defence, and I believe that my case is the only one in which this practice has been depaparted from. I shrink not from candour; from two farmers I have borrowed money, 10l. from Mr. White, and 20l. from Mr. Smith, who issued a warrant against me on my note, when Major Davis came to the Island; if this declaration, and these acts, be sufficient to break me, I shall be patient under, my dismissal, as I wish not to hold my place at the expense of honour and truth. I owed my appointment to Sandown to the right hon. the then Secretary at War, Mr.Bragge, who, on my own application, granted me the appointment in a manner which did the highest honour to his liberality, observing, that he felt himself happy to be at liberty to appoint me to the situation, from the favourable testimonies he had received of my conduct from the officers under whom I had served. To the right hon. Mr. Windham, his predecessor in office, I owed my former appointment of Assistant Barrack-Master of Out-Posts, who with equal liberality and feeling, in the midst of his important duties, listened attentively like Mr. Bragge, to the application of a private individual, and granted his request. To these two gentlemen, rendered as respectable by their private worth as by the situations they have filled, to the public at large, and to my own family and friends, I feel that I owe the justification of my character; and, under this conviction, Sir, I humbly beg that this letter, with the enclosed affidavits, may be favoured with the same publicity as has attended the charge laid against me, in order that. those who have heard the accusation may likewise hear my defence, and, with unbiassed judgment, draw their inference. You will permit me, Sir, here to comment on the conduct of Major Davis, as testified in the enclosed affidavits. It will be seen that the report made by him to the Barrack-Master-General of my frequent habits of drinking, and consequent inattention to the troops, was contradicted by the certificates of the commanding officers of the troops, who had occupied the barracks and posts for some months. This charge was wholly unprovoked by me, farther than by a discontinuance of every other attention to him from the period of his conversation at my table, except that obedience and deference due to a superior in office on all official communication; yet even then, unjustly as I had been accused, I held the sacred rights of hospitality too much in respect to violate them by a disclosure of his conversation, and at this moment, I should shrink from the thought of injuring him, were not the promulgation of his conduct necessary to my own justification. What an enemy then was Major Davis likely to become, when I stated to the right hon. the Secretary at War, the barns taken at enormous rents. Major Davis was the person who had taken those barns; Major Davis was the person sent down to act on the proposal of Mr. Day; was it the interest of Major Davis to make that proposal appear advantageous to government, after the agreements which he himself had made? I forbore to implicate him; in my letter appears no individual resentment, but a proposal for the public good; I might then, if actuated by rancour, have stated, that a mud hut, built by the owner for *eighteen pounds*, as I understand from a man employed in the erection, was rented annually at *one hundred and thirty pounds*, and the interior fitted up at the expense of government, and taken and agreed for by Major Davis. There was also transmitted by me to the Barrack-Master-General, and by the Barrack-Master-General transmitted to Major Davis, a plan and proposal of a house at Brading, to the construction of twelve officers, at sixty pounds per annum. On referring to the rents paid for officers lodgings and accommodations in 1804-5, it will be found, that seven pounds fifteen shillings was paid weekly for accommodations for ten officers; the house therefore offered by Mr. Kemp, in the above proposal to which I allude, and which he agreed to have ready in three months at 1l. 3s. 1d. per week, at the rate of 60l, yearly, makes a saving of 6l. 11s. 11d. per week, and two officers more accommodated.—Against the Affidavit of Ward, I enclose my own, together with those of my sisters. As to my catering for a Major, by supplicating Ward for a lamb, it is too low and egregiously contemptible for me to stoop to answer. I have received presents from him of poultry, and two pigs, and in return for those, and other civilities sworn to in my affidavit as having been received from him, made him a present of a horse, which I have no doubt he has still in his possession; and from other farmers I have also received presents of the same nature, and know that other Barrack-Masters have done the same. The tampering of one of my own department with Farmer Ward, is proved by my sister's affidavit and my own; early in November last, my sister and I accused Mr. Page of it to his face, telling him of Farmer Ward's declaration, which he no otherwise denied, than merely by saying, we were too hasty. To the receipts and accounts laying in the Barrack Office, I refer whether there ever appeared on the books of Sandown, any account of carting done either by Farmer Kent or Harvey, who, Ward says in his oath, I told him had given me their carting money. Farmer Ward farther adds, justly too, that I paid him his rent first, and his bill for carting after. The reason of this will be found in the inclosed official letter dated the first of January, from the Barrack Office; this was the delay which my adversaries had hoped was a strong presumption of my guilt, as it obliged me to separate the payments of the rent and cartage. I appeal to every unbiassed mind, whether a person intent on illegally demanding money from a man against his fixed determination not to part with it, would have chosen the very house of that man in which to make the demand; particularly, when he had the power of summoning him to his own. On the 3d of Jan, Farmer Ward, says, I forced him to give this money. Now, my letter to the Secretary at War was dated the 20th of December, only six days previous to this, and it will be seen that in the inclosure accompanying that letter, the barn at Bigbury, belonging to Ward, was one of those I pointed out to be given up, in consequence of Mr. Day's proposal; could I therefore consider myself safe in forcing money from a man, who must shortly have come to the knowledge of my being the instrument of his losing 218l, per annum, and be weak enough to suppose, that smarting under this loss, he would not promulgate this act of extortion? Farmer Ward artfully urges, that I pleaded my distresses from imprisonment, I am not ashamed to avow my involvements, which were consequences arising from having a family to support for four-years, on five shillings a day, my pay as Assistant Barrack-Master,of Out-Posts. In my letter to the Secretary I intimated, that I could point out other matters for consideration. I alluded to savings that could not fall within the calculation of a superior in office, but of one acting within the immediate sphere of Barrack-Master. The practicability of it I can prove to a demonstration, and it would be productive of some thousands a year, without taking from the comforts of any individual. There are two other matters which I could likewise suggest, the advantages of which I am persuaded would be acknowledged by office when pointed out. There are two Barrack-Masters now in the department against whom I could bring the most serious charges; yet,notwithstanding their enmity, which was partly combined with my dismissal, I feel reluctant to do so, feeling too acutely, as the head of a family, for the poverty into which my children are now plunged, even to wish to return it on the offspring of my enemies.— With every respect I submit the whole of my case to your consideration, and have the honour, &c. (Signed) Becher Westropp Atkins, late Barrack-Master, Sandown, Isle of Wight.
