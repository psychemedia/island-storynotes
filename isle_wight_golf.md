# Isle of WIght Golf Club



## Fore... The Isle of Golf

Although golf, as a game of sorts, has been played in Scotland since at least 1457 [The first documented mention of golf in Scotland appears in a 1457 Act of the Scottish Parliament, an edict issued by King James II of Scotland prohibiting the playing of the games of gowf and futball as these were a distraction from archery practice for military purposes.] it wasn't until the mid-nineteenth century that it started to grow as a formal activity.

According to Wikipedia, in 1880 England had just 12 courses, rising to 50 in 1887

Extract from the Act of 6 March 1457
'Item, it is ordained and the decreed that the lords and barons both spiritual and temporal should organise archery displays four times in the year. And that football and golf should be utterly condemned and stopped. And that a pair of targets should be made up at all parish churches and shooting should be practised each Sunday ... And concerning football and golf, we ordain that [those found playing these games] be punished by the local barons and, failing them, by the King's officers.'

The course was opened in 1882, had just nine holes and was for men only. The turf was imported from Cumbria, which may explain some of the more unusual plants seen today.
It was also one of the very first golf courses in England. It came close to challenging the Royal and Ancient (R&A) Golf Club of St Andrews in terms of prominence and was also the source of an authoritative set of rules of the game, which still apply today. In 1888 if you lost a ball at St Andrews, you lost the hole as well, but on the Royal course on the Isle of Wight you just dropped another ball and took a two-stroke penalty.
Some would sail into Bembridge Harbour at high tide, and play golf at low tide. In the 1930s, the actor and novelist David Niven was a keen golfer and an active member of the club.
The fortunes of the Royal Isle of Wight golf course began to wane in the post-war economic stringency, and the few remaining members decided to present their land to the National Trust in 1961 as an open space to be enjoyed by all. The clubhouse is now let by the National Trust as a holiday cottage.

The Royal Isle of Wight Golf Club can be said to have originated at a luncheon party held at the Royal Spithead Hotel in the spring of 1882, when to the assembled company that popular sportsman, Captain Jack Eaton R.N. suddenly proposed: "What was the Duver meant for?"
The party hazarded various suggestions, but Jack Easton would accept none of them crying out himself "It was made on purpose for golf". So across the harbour the party went and had explained to them the intricacies of a game which was at that time unknown in England, save to a few enthusiasts who played at Blackheath, Wimbledon and Westward Ho!
Jack Eaton’s enthusiasm quickly spread to his hearers, and almost before the tour of the Duver was over, they had promised one and all to become members of the new club, which it was decided to call the Isle of Wight Golf Club.
A man of action, this commander of the eastern division of the Isle of Wight Coastguards very soon obtained a lease of the ground from the Brading Harbour Company, and it was not long after the date of the luncheon party that men were set to work under the supervision of experts "with strong Gaelic dialects" to root up and cut down the gorse bushes, level the ground and transport freshly cut turf from the downs to the projected greens.
Naturally, the interest of the islanders was evoked in this new and wonderful game, and the preparations being made for the playing of it. Speculation as to the nature of the game ran high, some thinking it would be a sort of new kind of croquet, others that it would reveal itself as a form of dignified hockey with a touch of polo on foot. Both conceptions were about as far from the truth as that of an engineer of a steam yacht at that time in the harbour who "knowed it was worked somehow by steam, 'cos he heard 'em a talking’ about the best drive, and where the bunkers were to be."
The list of members slowly but steadily increased, and no inconsiderable gathering of people was present at the opening ceremony. The honour of driving the first ball fell to a Mrs Hambrough, wife of the club’s first captain, Dudley A. Hambrough, and she acquitted herself well in what must have been something of a trying ordeal. In strict truthfulness it must be recorded that at the first match the interest of many spectators was directed not so much at the players as at one of the caddies , who was a very pretty barmaid from the Royal Spithead Hotel.
These were but interludes in the development of the club, which each month added to its membership and on September 18th 1883 a letter was received from the Secretary of State intimating he had "had the honour to submit to the Queen you (the Secretary’s) request that the Isle of Wight Golf Club may be permitted to assume the title of 'Royal 'and that Her Majesty has been graciously please to accede to your request and to command that the Club be styled the 'Royal Isle of Wight Golf Club’."
With the bestowal of this royal patronage, the reputation of the club was still further enhanced and so many more members enrolled, that a special private room at the hotel had to be reserved for their special use. It may be remarked that this patronage has been extended by the royal family until the present day. The late King Edward was patron of the club until his death and our present King has been patron since his ascension in 1910. H.R.H. Prince Henry of Battenburg was captain for the years 1894-1895, and his two sons, Prince Leopold and Prince Maurice, are both Hon. Members at the present time.
The yearly crowdings at the two hotels resulted in the roof of the Royal Spithead Hotel being raised and another storey added, and this accommodation was further supplemented by a new private room which was built at a later date for the club members.
The plan shows how well and naturally the holes are laid out, giving a good length (2891 yards) width, and variety of holes, on such a relatively small area of ground. In fact it is doubtful if there is to be found anywhere, nine more attractive and varied holes in such a small compass; and yet despite its size, it will be found in playing (with a bogey of 37) to be a most enjoyable and difficult test of golf.
The natural hazards are sand dunes and hillocks, gorse, sea boundaries, and a public road, which round diagonally across the links, coming into prominence at 4 holes 1, 5, 6 and 9, and in a minor ways at the 8th, off a poorly played shot.
The three long holes, 1st, 8th and 9th are good three shot ones, in anything but calm, dry weather! The 3rd and 4th and 6th are superlative "fours" and would be hard to beat by comparison anywhere. The 2nd, 5th and 7th are very good and varied one shot holes, and of different length and difficulty and the 7th being a particularly clever punchbowl shot. Altogether the course is one of the most interesting nine hole in existence, and is full of character and individuality throughout, with the possible exception of the 5th, which is perhaps rather insipid and weak, but necessary, to keep up the proper sequence of play. This hole however together with the 6th are the only two remaining holes of the original course, as laid in 1892. That is to say they have been in constant play with little alterations for 47 years. 
The links and clubhouse are situated on The Duver, St Helens, Isle of Wight, 4 minutes by ferry boat to Bembridge Station, Southern Railway, 10 minutes to St Helen’s Station via the Mill Pond Walk and Harbour Yards; 20 minutes by a good "bus service to Ryde and Sea View from St Helen’s Village.
https://www.islandeye.co.uk/history/historic-parks/royal-isle-of-wight-ladies-golf-course-and-pavillion.html
The ladies course had 18 short holes with natural bunkers. The pavillion acted as the clubhouse as well. Gentlemen were allowed to play the course, so long as they were accompanied by a lady.

The Spithead Hotel opened in 1882. In the same year the railway was extended to Bembridge, (the station was on the opposite side of the road) and with a new pier for steamers, the hotel was well positioned for visitors.q
Royal patronage was granted to the hotel in the following year, 1883
The Royal Isle of Wight Golf Club, on the sand dunes across the harbour, was established by visitors to the hotel, the hotel was also popular with visitors to nearby Bembridge Sailing Club.
The hotel was demolished in 1989 and the site redeveloped.

History of Southsea Par 3 Golf Links
Southsea Golf Links was developed by a resident as a memorial to Southsea.
The course would be developed between Lumps Fort and the old coastguard cottage site, and designed by James Braid, a well known golfer of his time.
On sixth April, 1914, the links was opened, but no water supply was available until the twenty eighth of May, 1914, during this period, the grass greens were watered by men forming a chain with buckets to supply the green with water.
The course re-opened with a fee to players of: 6d for a half day and 1/- for the whole day. A mashte club ad putter were supplied for use on the course.

MINIATURE COURSE.

When he was President of the Local Government Board Mr John Burns M.P . opeened the cricket pavilion on the Brentham Garden Suburb. Another amenity for those dwell on that estate has been provided in the form of a miniature golf course of nine holes, which is to opened by the Mayor of Ealing next Saturday. This is the fourth miniature golf course that has been opened in the country, and provides another example of how garden suburbs developed on the co-partnership principle can cater for the recreations of all.

The Opening of a New Golf Course in Miniature at Brentham

A new miniature golf course — the first in London — attached to the Brentham Garden Suburb, was opened by the Mayor of Ealing. The course was inaugurated by a match between the Borough Surveyor (Mr. W. R. Hicks) and the Deputy-Mayor (Councillor J. G. Eden, J.P.) 1. a general view of the course. 2 The Borough Surveyor "drives" off the first tee. 3. The Deputy Mayor gets out of a bunker ("Daily Graphic", photographs.)

A miniature golf course at Brentham was declared open by the Mayor of Ealing (Councillor E. J. Morgan, J.P.) on Saturday afternoon. This course is the third of its kind in the United Kingdom, and the first of any kind attached to a garden suburb. Like many ambition schemes, it had a small beginning, a few ardent players commening by striking a ball into a single hole, as occurs in many back gardens all over the country, and, if our humourous cartoonists are to be believed, in many drawing rooms too. The idea took root, and this single hole mutliplied into nine, and the proud inhabitants of Brentham were then quite justified in claiming not only that they had got "a hole or two," but that they possessed a "course". For those who, like Sarah Battle, prefer "the rigour of the game," an extended course would make a stronger appeal, but there can be no doub that this miniature course meets a real demand, and will be largely patronised.

The climatic conditions were not very favourable when the Mayor of Ealing, together with the Deputy Mayor (Councillor J. G. Eden), Councillor E. Newson and the Borough Surveyor Mr. W. R. Hicks), proceeded to the first green, where they were welcomed by the Chairman of the Ealing Tenants, Limited, Mr William Hutchings, who, in the course of a short address, said that the presence of the Mayor served to demonstrate the close connection between Brentham and the central parts of Ealing.

The then then "drove" the first ball, good and true, and declared the course open.

Mr S. A. C. Smith (chairman of the golf club), thanked the Mayor on behalf of the golf club, for his presence that afternoon, and in replying.

The Mayor said that it afforded him great pleasure to come there that afternoon. To commemorate the occasion he was going to offer a cup for competition among the members, which was never to be won outright (applause).

The first round on the new course was then played by the Deputy Mayor and the Borough Surveyor, the former winning by one hole up.

MINIATURE GOLF.

It would seem that the little links just opened at Brentham is a very excellent idea, and I am told that the municipal authorities of a seaside resort in the South of England will have a similar course ready when they receive their large influx of visitors in the summer months. It must not be supposed that this form of miniature golf is a copy of clock golf, for the latter is purely and simply a putting match from start to finish. Miniature golf consists of a certain number of real golfing holes compressed within the smallest limits. There is one, privately owned, in Wales, which is a very stiff test indeed. I have always thought that the most difficult golf course in the world could be designed if the architect insisted that the "Bogey" for each hole must be "three." Can you not imagine eighteen holes that were composed of pitching shots over a wilderness of gorse with an occasional stream to carry from the tee? I very much doubt whether Harry Vardon would hole that course in Bogey, for, when nearing the end of the round, it would become a question of nerves. Now, in building an ideal golf course in miniature, a brook or running water is essential, for this is the finest hazard that was ever invented by nature. One has only to be told by the caddie that there is some water near the green to carry, and one's sole endeavour is to introduce a high shot with a mashie which will render us secure from the water hazard. It is in the endeavour to effect this stroke with a mashie that the player fails. He is so accustomed to taking a putter when twenty yards from the pin that he will instinctively "fluff" his approach when realising that there is something difficult to carry. In time to come your brook will become a landmark, for it will have gained a reputation second only to that of the Burn at St. Andrews, where men and women golfers place their ball under the bank and know not why they do so. I am told by a friend who takes particular interest in miniature golf that the correct length for the course should be one thousand yards. I am no mathematician, so I cannot suggest how many square yards this should represent, but a good large field could very quickly be turned into a first-class miniature links.

There should, according to my notions, be one hole where the player can hit hard with, say, an iron, for I cannot imagine anything more exhausting for the nerves than a cessation of pitching shots. This would place too large a premium on the putting, which is just what many would be wishful to avoid. I speak from a personal point of view, of course, for I have never yet met a golfer who admitted that he was a bad putter. I know several who call themselves "unlucky putters," but that is not quite the same thing. Half the fun in laying out one's own miniature links is that we shall be able to invent such ingenious hazards. A large roller placed close to the pin would make the man on the tee our own golfing enemy, we will hope shudder with fear. Then, having placed his shot well shy of the green, an outdoor lackey, in our service, will creep up from behind a bush and remove the roller as though he had only left it there for the purpose of taking a rest. Another blind hazard could be admirably designed by digging a trench parallel to the green. It would be necessary to fork up the turf on the tee side, for, otherwise, the trench would be visible, and that would never do. I fancy that many accurate shots would find their way to the bottom of this gutter, and the sensible local man would play his shot so as to keep the ball well short of this obstacle. I am quite sure that before the year is out there will be any number of miniature golf courses in this country. It will be a boon to the busy man who can scarcely find time to play a full round on his local course in the winter. He would bless the new innovation and gain much pleasure, and practice, it may be noted, by strolling over nine little holes that demanded exceeding accuracy in the short game.

One supposes that more than nine holes will rarely be found, for space is at a premium in the country at the present time, although it should be suggested, as an additional benefit to the busy golfer, that these little links will not be in the country, but quite close to the town. There are innumerable public parks where such courses could be made, and it only needs the co-operation of the municipal authorities and courses will be made.

It is so easy to imagine a man saying in 1915, "Come and play golf with me for the week-end. I have my own course, you know."

H. L. Dobree.

MAYOR OPENS NEW SOUTHSEA GOLF COURSE.

The Southsea miniature golf course, prepared by the muicipality, was opened on Saturday under the happiest auspices by the Mayor (Alderman J. H. Cork., K. I. H.) in brilliant weather and in the presence of a large and interested company. His Worship was accompanied by the Mayoress (Mrs. Cork), Mrs. F. Corke. and other ladies; and amongst those also present  were the Chairman of the Parks Committee  (Alderman H. I. Evans. J.P.), the Vice-Chairman (Councillor J. W. Perkins), Councillors Corbin, Mark Gill, J.P., Dr. Childe, and E. S. Main, Sir Thomas Bramsdon and Lady Bramsdon, the Borough engineer (Mr. A. W, Ward), the Borough Treasurer (Mr. A. F. Bone), Brig.-General L. T. Pease, R.M.A., Commander Ellis, R. N., etc.

The Mayor was provided with a special  silver-plated mashie, bearing a suitable inscription, and a new golf ball; and punctually at three o'clock he proceeded to the first tee, divested himself of his over-coat, and after Mr. Edmonds, Superintendent of Parks) had teed up the ball, his Worship hit it a beautiful clean lofted shot 50 yards straight down the course. It was a shot which would have done credit to a low handicap golfer. Not a blade of grass was injured, and the fear ot injuring the turf had caused the Mayor grave anxiety. The applause which followed the shot was fully deserved. In a few appropriate words the Mayor then declared the course open for the use of the public and wished it success.

Without delay Mr. W. B. Smith, the professional at Hayling, and Mr. A. Hamilton, the "pro." at Rowland's Castle, started off to play a match of 36 holes, or four times round the course. The match was keenly contested and was evidently much enjoyed by the company, which included many golfers to whom the players were well known. At the end of the first round Smith was one up, taking 30 to Hamilton's 31. In the second round Smith took 31 to Hamilton's 27, which left Hamilton 3 up. He had two 2's in this round. In the third round Smith had two 2's, and took 27 to Hamiton's 29. They were then all square, although Smith had takeen 88 to Hamitlon's 87. In the fourth round Smith took 31, four 4's and fire 3's, and Hamilton had a sequence of nine 3's. 27; so Hamilton won by 3 up and 2 to play-114 strokes to Smith's 119. Both players had bad luck in putts which were going straight for the bole stopping three or four inches short through the new stiff grass, and Smith had most of the bad luck in stymies, having no fewer than seven to negotiate. Several he did successfully, one especially at the sixth hole. Here his opponent's ball was only nine inches in front and four inches from the hole. After a good deal of consideration he lifted it beautifully into the tin, and smiled his appreciation of the applause which followed. He also had a round of applause when he holed a twenty-yard putt on the third round for a two.

After the match a good many of those present played round the course, and no doubt many golfers will take an early opportunity of practising the short game there. Careful note was taken by Mr Edmonds, the Parks Superintendent, of points where there is danger of the ball getting into the roads, and no doubt the Parks Committee will have wire netting put up. A photographer was busy taking pictures of the opening ceremony and incidents during the afternoon, with a view to supplying the Illustrated Press with views of the latest addition to the many attractions of Southsea.

It was clearly domstrated during the match that the hazards are too easy. The grass ought to be allowed to grow longer both in the trench and on the raised banks; but the arrangement of the holes does credit to James Braid, who designed them, and Mr. A. W. Ward. the Borough Engineer, who prepared the plans in conjunction with Braid.

https://ippa.cloud/pitch-putt/pp-history/ This first public course, with 9 short par 3 (between 50 and 91 meters) is undoubtedly the "cradle" of the P&P as we know it today, although at the time, this modality was still known as "Miniature Golf". This course is still very popular and is owned by the 'Portsmouth City Council'.

FIFTY YEARS OF GOLF By HORACE G. HUTCHINSON "Bembridge had always a charming little course, though crossing like a cat's cradle in places and more dangerous than most battles when there were many players. I gave dire offence there by writing that after my first tee shot, which was heavily pulled on to the seashore, the ball was at length found inside a dead and derelict dog—emphatically a bad lie! But there was not more than the licence almost permissible taken in this account: the ball actually was very near a dead dog; and why should there be offence in the suggestion? It was not implied that it was part of the duty of the Bembridge green committee to scavenge the seashore. However, the dog has been washed away now, and, I hope, the offence also." https://www.gutenberg.org/files/37394/37394-h/37394-h.htm
https://www.sthelensiw.org.uk/explore-st-helens/heritage-trail/the-golf-course/ The Royal Isle of Wight Golf Club was founded in 1882 and was responsible for much of the development of the modern game of Golf, at one point challenging St Andrews as the source of the authoritative rules of the game and even forcing changes in some of the St Andrews rules. The St Helen's Rules were in use from 1886-1890 when standardised St Andrew’s rules were adopted having incorporated some of the St Helen's rules.
The course was opened in 1882, had just nine holes and was for men only. The turf was imported from Cumbria, which may explain some of the more unusual plants seen today. It was also one of the very first golf courses in England. It came close to challenging the Royal and Ancient (R&A) Golf Club of St Andrews in terms of prominence and was also the source of an authoritative set of rules of the game, which still apply today. In 1888 if you lost a ball at St Andrews, you lost the hole as well, but on the Royal course on the Isle of Wight you just dropped another ball and took a two-stroke penalty.
Royal patronage 
Prince Edward of Saxe-Weimar was the first president, and Queen Victoria’s eldest son (later to become Edward VII) became a member in 1883. This meant that the golf club was given 'Royal' status.
Several other European princes and monarchs were involved, mainly because of the Island links with Queen Victoria at Osborne House. Queen Victoria’s youngest daughter, Princess Beatrice, was President of the Club until she died in 1940. As the popularity of the course increased, the Spithead Hotel roof was raised to cope with the influx of golfing guests.
Black’s Guide in 1899 commented that 'the Sailing Club vies with the golf as an attraction to visitors of the better class. In short, Bembridge is a select rather than a popular resort’. https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/st-helens-duver/features/the-royal-isle-of-wight-golf-club-st-helens-duver

ISLE WIGHT GOLF CLUB.—

At a meeting held at the Marine Hotel, Ventnor, on July 31, a golf club was formed for the island, to be called the Isle of Wight Golf Club. The club have secured an excellent ground at St. Helens, where a beautiful course of nine holes will be made. The course will he very spirting, and similar in nature to Hoylake, North Berwick, &c. It is situated close to Bembridge, where a first-rate hotel has recently opened. The scenery in the neighbourhood is romantic in the extreme, commanding extensive views of the sea. Spithead, &c. It is hoped to arrange an opening day at an early date, of which due notice will be given. The hon. sec.. Mr J. S. Eaton, Mountheld, Bonchurch, Isle of Wight, will be glad to forward all requisite information.

ISLE OF WIGHT GOLF CLUB.

THIS club was formally opened for play in the Dover, at St. Helens, on Monday, the 11th inst. A considerable number of the members and their friends lunched at the Royal Spithead Hotel at Bembridge, where an excellent repast was prepared by the manager. The hon. sec.

This club, which has been estalished in connection with the Royal Spithead Hotel here, held its first autumn meeting on Thursday. Unfortunately the weather was totally against good scoring. Eight couples started to compete for the prizes, consisting of a gold medal, presented by Mr C. Tottenham; a claret jug, presented by Mrs Henley Grose Smith; and a set of gold clubs and one dozen balls presented by the club. On examining the cards it was found there was a tie between Captain Corse Scott and Mr R. B. Molesworth at 95 strokes for the Tottenham gold medal, and, on playing off the tie, Mr Molesworth won, doing the round in 88 strokes. Captain C. Scott, with a gross score of 95, reduced by an allowance of 8 to 87, carried off Mrs H. Grose Smith's much coveted prize. The set of clubs was won by Captain Eaton, R.N., with a score of 99 reduced by an allowance of 2 to 97, and the prize of golf balls was won by Mr A. J.

BEMBRIDGE.

To the Editor of the Isle of Wight Observer.
Sir, — I observe in your issue of last Saturday, in reference to the Isle of Wight Golf Club, that it is stated that the club is in connection with the Royal Spithead Hotel, Bembridge. As this is in no way the case, I shall be much obliged by your correcting the statement in your next issue. The Golf Club merely holds its dinners, &c, there, and of course it is the natural place for members from a distance to stay at when visiting the Island for golf. Yours faithfully, J. P. EATON, Hon. Sec. November 6th, 1882.

ST. HELEN'S. Royal Isle of Wight Golf Club.

— H.R.H. the Prince of Wales has graciously consented to become the patron of this club, and H.S.H. Prince Edward of Saxe-Weimar has been pleased to accept the presidency. The distinguished honour thus conferred upon the club comes most opportunely when we are celebrating the anniversary of its creation. On July 31st of last year the club was formed, on September llth the club was opened for play, and up to the present time over 120 members have been elected. The ground steadily improves under the able direction of J. Beveridge, the custodian, and his brother Daniel, who are at the same time second to none in the art of club making. His Royal Highness' s early departure from the Island has precluded the possibility of a visit to Bembridge, but it is hoped that at no distant date the club may be honoured by a visit, when Their Royal and Serene Highnesses will receive a true golfer's welcome.
