AND

THE Declaration stated, that the Defendant, on the 19th day of November, 1781, and on divers other days and times, between  that day and the 24th of the same month, at Westminster, in the county of Middlesex, with force and arms, made an assault on Seymour, the Wife of the Plaintiff, and then and there debauched, deflowered, lay with, and carnally knew her, the said Seymour, to the Plaintiff's damage of 20,000l.

To this declaration the Defendant pleaded not guilty, and thereupon issue was joined.

Counsel for the Plaintiff. Counsel for the Defendant,
Mr. Attorney General, Mr. Bearcroft,
Mr. Lee, Mr. Ho worth,
Mr. D U N N I N G . M r. P E C H E L L «
Mr. Erskine.

ON the opening of Mr. Attorney General, it appeared that the Plaintiff lives at Apuldurcomb, in the Isle of Wight, and that he is worth about 5000l. a year; that Lady Worsley is the Daughter of Sir John Fleming, who is dead, and with whom Sir Richard had a fortune of about 70,000l. or upwards; that her Mother was married to Mr. Lascelles, of Yorkshire, and her Sister to Lord Harrington. The Plaintiff and she were married on the 15th of September, 1775; and they have issue of the marriage two children, a son and a daughter; the first, born within a year or two after their marriage; and the latter, in August last.

That the Defendant was an officer in the Hampshire militia, of which the Plaintiff is Colonel, and that he had only been acquainted with him from the end of February, or the beginning of March, 1781; that their acquaintance commenced in consequence of a burgage-tenure Mr. Bisset was possessed of in the Isle of Wight, which, added to an estate worth about 800l. a year in Somersetshire, makes his income about 1500l. a year, and which Sir Richard, for parliamentary convenience, wanted to purchase; that, in consequence of letters having passed between them on that occasion, their first personal interview was by the means of Mr. Clarke, the receiver of Mr. Bisset's rents; and that, soon after their acquaintance. Sir Richard gave him a commission in his regiment.

The greatest intimacy subsisted between them; the Plaintiff had a house at Maidstone, in Kent, where the Defendant used to visit whilst in camp at Coxheath. When the camp broke up, they came to Lewes, where Sir Richard had a house, and Mr. Bisset lodgings; and the firmest attachment subsisted between them, till the unhappy event took place, which, is the subject of this action.

EVIDENCE for the PLAINTIFF.

Q. What year?— In the year 1781.

Q.  Had you any previous acquaintance with Captain Bisset?— None, Sir.

Q. Then that was your first knowledge of him?— My first knowledge of him was at High Wickam. I aaw him on the parade there.

Q. Do you remember their coming to Lewes at the breaking up of the camp?— Yes, Lewes was the place of the head-quarters.

Q. I take it for granted he was a man of fashion, and kept company?— Yes, Sir.

Q. In the course of the summer, was he ever at Sir Richard's house at Maidstone?— Yes, Sir.

Q. During the time Captain Bisset was in his winter quarters, I presume he had lodgings?— Yes; he had lodgings in Lewes.

Q. And Sir Richard Worsley had a house there?—Yes, Sir.

Q. Be ao good as to tell us the date?— On Sunday the 18th of November, they drank tea, and supped at my house.

Q. Upon whose invitation?— Mine, and the family's.

Q. It was a general invitation, I suppose?— Yes; Married Ladies were invited, as well as their Husbands.

Q. Do you recoiled whether Sir Richard Worsley came in consequence of that invitation?— He did not come. About ten o'clock in the evening, he sent an apology by Captain Worsley, that he was not very well, and begged to be excused; he could not wait upon us that evening; he was was taking some sack-whey.

Q. Did Lady Worsley come?—Lady Worsley came about seven o'clock in the evening, at tea time.

Q. Do you recoiled who gave the first intimation for the company to depart?— Lady Worsley was for breaking up very early: she made the motion between twelve and one o'clock. Mrs. Leversage was afraid she did not like her company, by her wanting to break up so soon, and wished her to atay a little longer. She sat down again; and, to the best of my recollection, Captain Bisset looked at his watch, and said, Don't go yet. She sat down again, and staid till near a quarter after one.

Q. What became of Lady Worsley after that?— I rang the bell for a servant to light them home; but none coming, I took a candle, and opened the door myself, intending to light them home, as Sir Richard Worsley's house was nearly opposite. I went as far as within a few yards of Sir Richard's door, and then Captain Bisset desired I would not trouble myself to go any further, so I wished them a good night, and returned to my house.

Q. They took their leave then in the manner you have stated?— Yes, Sir.

Q. And you saw no more of them.?— No, I saw no more of them.

Q. When did you next see, or hear of them?— Between four and five o'clock in the morning, I heard a violent rapping at the door. I immediately got up and went to the window to see who it was; and I found it was one of Sir Richard Worsley's servants: he came with Sir Richard Worsley's compliments to desire Lady Worsley would come home. I told him that Lady Worsley was not at my house, and that I had not seen her since one o'clock.—About a quarter of an hour, or ten minutes after I heard another knocking at the door, I went to the window, and found it was Sir Richard Worsley himself; he says, Leversage, where is Lady Worsley?

*Mr. Attorney General*. Did you go to Chapman's, to make any enquiry there?— No: he desired to be let in, and I came down and let him in.

Q. Do you know any thing more of this transaction?— No, I do not.

Q. Do you know Captain Bissett's hand-writing?— I do not.

Examined by Mr. Lee.

Do you recoiled Mr. Bissett's coming home to his lodgings at your house?— I don't remember his coming home.

Do you recoiled any particulars of hearing or speaking to him, or seeing him in the house?— About half pail three, or near four, he knocked at my chamber door. I called to know who was there, and Mr. Bissett asked me to let him light a candle. I got up and went to the door, and he lit his candle at my door.

Had you any opportunity of knowing whether Mr. Bissett was at that time alone, or whether he had any company with him?— I don't know that: when he lit his candle, he was in his bed gown, or morning gown; and when he had lit his candle, he went to his own room again. Some little time afterwards he came out, and called Connolly, and desired him to go downstairs: and in a very little time afterwards, (I don't know how long, it might be about ten minutes afterwards) Mr. Bissett called to the man again; and then I think Connolly, or somebody else, went out of the door. In about ten minutes, or a quarter of an hour after that, I heard a noise in Mr. Bissett's room, of throwing up the fall). I got out of bed, and went to his room to wee if he wanted any thing. I rapped at the door, and asked him if he wanted any assistance: Are not you well? fays 1} (hall I call the maid? He said, No. I did call the maid; and then I went to bed again. Presently, the person who went out, whoever it was, came in again; and soon after that there was a chaise came to the door; it did not flop at the door, but went further on to turn about: and some little time after, I heard him and somebody else go down flairs; and then I heard the chaise drive off.

Mr. Attorney General. What o'clock might that be?— -About a quarter before five; it was before it was light.

Lord Mansfield. This is nothing but travelling a long way about; why don't you come to the point, and bring them to London at once?

The End of the Evidence for the Plaintiff .

MR. BBARCR0FT, in answer to this evidence, did not attempt to make any defence in controvertion of the charge exhibited against the Defendant, but was very ready to admit, that the Plaintiff was intitled to a verdict. The only question which then remained, was upon the subject of damages; in mitigation of which only he would defend his client; and did not doubt to prove, to the satisfaction of the Jury, that Sir Richard not only acquiesced under repeated adts of his own dishonour with various persons, but even excited and encouraged it : On which Lord Mansfield laid, If a Plaintiff encourages, or is privy to, or consenting at all, or contributing to the debauchery of his Wife, or joins in it, he ought not to recover a verdict.

Mr. Bearcroft then Rated, That he could not only prove this to be the fact, but that he should prove by the Affidavits of the Woman who attended the Bath at Maidstone, that the Plaintiff there had absolutely raised the Defendant upon his (boulders to view his naked Wife while bathing, and at the fame time called to her, saying, Seymour! Seymour! Bisset is looking at you; and that (he, on coming out after (he had dressed herself, joined the Gentlemen; and they all went off together in a hearty laugh at the transaction which had passed. The Bathing-woman was ill, and could not attend the trial herself to give evidence of this fact; but that it had been agreed between the parties, that the Attornies on each side should go down to the place for the purpose of taking the Affidavits, and in order to view the situation; which they had done, and which affidavits would be read.

That the Defendant could not possibly be the Father of the Child born in August last, as his first acquaintance with the Plaintiff commenced only in March 5 so that he had not bastardized the Plaintiff's issue.

He wondered why they had not called some persons belonging to, or about the family, in order to prove how the parties lived together; a circumstance very material in a case like this: They had only called one person belonging to the family; that was the Butler, who had lived in the house but one day, and who, of course, could not speak to that point.

That the licentious conduct of Lady Worsley was so notorious, that it had been the subject of common conversation: and that many Ladies of Distinction in the Isle of Wight and elsewhere had frequently remonstrated with Sir Richard on that subject, and told him, that if he did not attempt to restrain her conduct, her character would be ruined and destroyed : that the answer Sir Richard made was, that Lady Worsley liked it, and he chose to doit to oblige her; upon which a very sensible Lady, who had frequently remonstrated with him on the subject, replied, "If this is the case, God help you, you are the most contented Husband I ever knew," and that from, the Lady's many prior connections, the idea of seduction by the present Defendant was totally done away.

EVIDENCE for the DEFENDANT.
MARY MARRIOT
Being unable to attend the Trial, the following
Affidavits were read.

Mary Marriot deposed, that Lady Worsley used to come to the cold bath, near Maidstone, to bathe, and that she used to attend her; that Sir Richard and Mr. Bidet were generally with her; and that the last time she came, which was about noon, in September last, and at the latter end of the hop-season, Sir Richard Worsley and Mr. Bidet Raid at the door without, while die bathed; that after she had bathed, die retired into a corner to put on her shift, as Ladies usually do after bath- ins, and then returned to dress herself, and sat herself down on the seat: that there is a window over the door of the building in which the bath is, and which is the only inlet for light into the bath, and from which any person, who is sitting down on the seat, may be seen, but not when retired into the corner; that when she had almost finished dressing herself, Sir Richard tapped at the door, and said, "Seymour! Seymour! Bisset is going to get up to look at you," or words to that effect; and, looking round, she saw his face at the window: that he continued there about five minutes; that she did not see the Plaintiff on the outside, but believes he must help the Defendant up; and that after Lady Worsley had dressed herself, She went out, and they were all merry and laughing together; that, excepting this, the never saw any improper conduct or behaviour in the said three persons, unless what is above stated may be thought so.

In addition to this, there was another Affidavit read, in which the believed that Mr. Bisset could not have got up to the window, unless he had been assisted by Sir Richard, or stood upon his shoulders; and that Sir Richard might easily have pulled him down if he pleased.

Lord Mansfield. That is too general a question.

Q. Where was she?— In town, at Sir Richard's house.

Lord Mansfield . You might have told them, when they asked you, that you desired to be excused.
The End of the Evidence for the Defendants

Mr. J. FAR RER, Attorney for the Plaintiff, sworn on behalf of the Plaintiff.

Examined by Mr. Attorney-General.

Q. You went down to the Cold Bath mentioned in the Affidavit?— Yes, Sir.

Q. Did you see the place on which Mr. Bissett got to look into the Bath? And do you think he could do it without the assistance of Sir Richard?- I believe he might do it with a great deal of ease, and without assistance.

Q. What is the height?- It is about breast- high; there is an arm-chair on the outside; and when I was on the chair, I could raise myself up to the window very easily.

Q. How many feet high may it be?— About four feet.

Mr. Bearcroft. Where is the seat?— On the outside of the Bath.

Mr. Attorney-General made a short reply upon the subject of Damages and having, in commenting on Lord Deerhurst's Evidence, mistook him in that part where his Lordship says he went to Southampton with Lady Worsley, he rose to explain it, and said that he remained at Southampton with her twenty-four hours, and then returned; and that she staid three or four days.

LORD MANSFIELD.
Gentlemen of the JURY,

THERE arises upon this evidence a serious question for your consideration.- The nature of the a&ion is such, that the Defendant cannot confess a Verdict because this is between the Husband and Wife and the Adulterer; and further proceedings may be had : therefore the Verdict you give mu ft be out of the truth and justice of the case, and the justice of the Evidence.

Now, the single question is, Whether Sir Richard has not been privy to the prostitution of his Wife, assenting to, encouraging and exciting even this Defendant? And, if he is fo, upon your opinion of the Evidence, he ought not to recover in this Action— If he is not, why then the only question that remains, is upon the subject of Damages; upon which I will not say a word to you. You are the best judges of that.

This Woman, for three or four years, has been prostituted with a variety of people; that is extremely clear. A stronger instance than the Doctors appearance this day, and what he has said, need not have been brought.— In the year 1779 Lord Deerhurst knew Lady Worsley; she was very profligate, and no step was taken by Sir Richard to prevent her: he continued in the Me of Wight ten days, and he has mentioned a conversation that passed between him and Sir Richard, which ought to be laid out of the case, because it seems to be ironical: "that many young men had tried her, without success; and that he might take his chance with her." But he says, once the Plaintiff found him in Lady Worsley's dressing-room at four o'clock in the morning; and he only says to him, "Deerhurst, how came you here? And there is no further explanation or examination between them. Is it not extraordinary to find a Gentleman in his Lady's dressing-room at four o'clock in the morning, and nothing further said? All is well; they are all good company the next morning; and fame few days afterwards Lady Worsley is going to Southampton. At the fame time Sir Richard goes eight miles with her, and leaves Lord Deerhurst to go on with her to Southampton : he goes on with her to Southampton; he stays there twenty-four hours, and she stays three or four days: — yet there is no appearance of Jealousy in the Husband!! This evidence deserves your consideration.

Another piece of evidence, is that of the Woman at the Bath at Maidstone; she swears, she believes it was impossible for Mr. Bissett to have got up the height of the balcony, to look into the Bath, unless he had stood upon Sir Richard's shoulders: but this is matter of belief; and they have called the Attorney, and you have heard his evidence: he went down there to take the Affidavits: he says he got up with a great deal of ease, and without assistance; that he got up first on an arm-chair which stood on the outside of the Bath, and then it was only four feet above him; so that, if he had not stood upon Sir Richard's shoulders, he might easily have pulled him down if he pleased; instead of which he only taps at the door, and fays, Seymour! Seymour! Bissett is looking at you. And when she is dressed and comes out, she joins them, and they are all jolly and merry, and laughing, and go away together.

This is the evidence which they have given; and if upon that evidence you think the Huf- band was privy to, consenting, and encouraging this debauchery, he ought not to have your Verdict; but if you think he is intitled to your Verdict, then the only point for your consideration is, What Damages you will give. — You will consider of your Verdict, and give what Damages you think proper.

The Jury went out of court, and after debating near an hour, returned with a Verdict for the Plaintiff, giving him only One shilling Damages.

THE END.
