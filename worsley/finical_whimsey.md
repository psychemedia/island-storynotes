MEMOIRS OF SIR FINICAL WHIMSY AND HIS LADY.

INTERSPERSED WITH A VARIETY OF AUTHENTIC ANECDOTES AND CHARACTERS.

"I had been happy, if the general camp

SHAKESPEAR.

DEDICATION TO THE Right Hon. Lady GROSVENOR.

It is become a maxim in these refined times to see female prostitution as a political good. In that light we may look up to your ladyship, as the most distinguished character among the political conveniences of the present age. It may be argued that no man's wife, sister, or daughter would be in a state of security, if women of your ladyship's spirit did not stand forth the guardians of female chastity, and by preventing the evil, secure us from a rehearsal of the Sabine rape. Even that sagacious people the Athenians were of opinion that *spirited* ladies had their *excellencies*, and it may runs gratify ypur ladyship's curiosity to enquire by what means they obtained esteem in a country, where women in general were distinguished by their rigid morals, and celebriety. The Courtezans were at that time blended in a great degree with religious ceremonies. The goddess of beauty, who had altars consecrated to her shrine, was considered as their patroness, and whom the Athenians worshipped. They invoked Venus in times of the greatest peril. The uncommon fame of Miltiades and Themistocles was in a great measure owing to the Lais's singing hymns to the goddess after their battles, and thereby consecrating their victories.

Among the Grecians, Courtezans had it in their power to gain an ascendency over the greatest Logicians, consequently had a great influence in the government of their state. Demosthenes, the terror even of tyrants, was compelled to submit to the impulse of their charms, and it was said of him with equal truth and poignancy, "That the study of years was annihilated in an hour's conversation with a fine woman."

Phrynia had a golden statue erected to her memory at Delphos, between the mausoleums of two kings, and the death of many Courtezans was succeeded by magnificent monuments, to commemorate their remembrance; whilst many heroes, who died in defence of their country, were instantly forgot, and had not a stone to tell where they lay.

In fine, Courtezans have been estimated in the most virtuous times according to their attractions; while other women, who laid claim to chastity as their only merit, have sunk in total obscurity.

From these various circumstances, we may account for the honors, which women of your ladyship's stamp so frequently received in Greece; otherwise it would have been difficult to conceive how six or seven authors would have consecrated their pens to celebrate them; how three of the most celebrated painters, had devoted their pencils solely to pourtray them; how several Grecian poets had invoked their muses to honor them; in a word, it would be difficult otherwise to assign a cause why the greatest men should, with the keenest avidity, aim at being introduced into their company; that Aspasia should be the sole herald of peace or war; or that Phrynia should have a statute of gold erected to her memory. The uninformed traveller approaching the walls of Athens fancies this monument to be the tomb of Miltiades, or Pericles, or some hero equally renowned, but upon his nearer approach, he is informed it is the Mausoleum of an Athenian Courtezan, whose memory is thus pompously blazoned.

Of all the renowned warriors that fought for their country in Asia, there is not one whose glorious deeds are commemorated with a monument. Such, however, were the honors paid by that dissipated, voluptuous and sensual people at the shrine of beauty.

This sketch of the custom of the ancients will we hope apologize to your ladyship, for the liberty we have taken, in celebrating the history of the moderns; for the time may yet arrive when a Grosvenor, a Ligonier, or a Worsley, may cut a figure in history that will outvie the Messalina's of the ancients, and bring the people of this country into that *respectable situation*, that the Romans aspired to under the auspices of that *virtuous Lady*.

MEMOIRs, &c.

TO DO

THE Family of the Whimsy's have never been remarkable for producing heroes or conjurers. Mrs. Pilkington, in her Memoirs, has published a variety of anecdotes of one of sir Finical's ancestors, which compared with the conduct of the B- himself, would almost: persuade us that vanity and folly are the, hereditary characteristics of the family. The father of this gentleman became a sacrifice at the shrine of Bacchus before sir Finical had attained the first year of his minority, and bequeathed his estate to two distant relations, for their sole benefit and emolument, till his only child, sir Finical should arrive at the age of twenty-one years; reserving a trifle only to defray sr of his education and support till he arrived at that age. Under this restraint, he had recourse to the common modes of supplying his extravagance during his minority, and consequently found himself exceedingly embarrassed when he came to the possession of his estate. . sixty thousand pounds was said to be the incumbrance; and to remove it, a match with a wealthy heiress was recommended, As the most speedy and effectual method. The Miss F of in Vrlchire were pointed out as young ladies whose family and connections would be a valuable acquisition to the young B------, and the fortune they possessed of seventy thousand pounds each, removed every obstacle that might otherwise have been a bar to the union. A new carriage, new liveries, and every external requisite was accordingly provided, and sir Finical, with his trusty steward and privy counsellor, uitam, the attorney of N-, set off for ----shire, to make a conquel of the seventy thousand pounds fortune. The eldest sister was the object the B------ meant to besiege; but this lady, who is an ornament to her sex, and has since given her hand to a Neble Ea xl discovered the emptiness of her admirer, and gave him a positive refusal on his first outset. sir Finical then offered his hand to the younger Ger, who being only in her fourteenth Year, and possessing more forwardness than discretion, yielded her person and fortune to a man, who, the shortest experience convinced her, was the last i in the world with whom she could be happy.

The vanity of. e upon n acquisition of 1 ty and fortune is not to be conceived. The bride was ushered to his country mansion with the pageantry and pomp of an eastern sultana, and all the young noblemen and gentlemen of his acquaintance were invited to partake his happiness. The Duke of -----, the Marquis of =====, and the Lords A------, P., M, ae , the honourable Mr. | ! FOR ==, and the honourable Ir. W-----, were among the number of his first visitors. They were continually striving to outvie each other, in attention and politeness to the young bride, and sir Finical was not a little pleased at the fancied envy, which he supposed himself the object of. He was however possessed of too generous a soul to monopolize her charms; and never seemed. so, well pleased as when he could introduce his friends to a participation of his happiness.

The first instance of his singular indulgence to his companions, that came to the knowledge of the ton was during the visit of this Petit Partie at A------, sir Finical came running to them as they were returned from the chace on a winter's morning, now my dear boys I will give you a sight of the most beautiful woman in the world; and taking them to a glass door that communicated from his study to her ladyship's dressing room, while the unsuspecting beauty was unrobing, presented them with a a2 fide glance of the toilet. It must be imagined that such condescension in a husband, would soon be productive of the loosest demeanor in tlie wife; but we cannot learn that her Ladyship either forgot her duty to herself or her character, till the commencement of the first campaign of the M., where her introduction into diflipation, idleness and gallantry, added to the carelessness, and .pernicious precepts and examples of her husband, first taught n to nn to the e of Fon and dishonour.

| Ensign W the first shs POND 7K el gence of her partiality. His figure, his politeness, and a- H Es : bilities, conspired to render him the favorite, and it required all the female policy her ladyship was mistress | * . 5 of, to secure the Adonis to her own erg. | | 

Lo 

This ms was >the fon of 1 a Captain it in 15 Navy, and embarked in the M------ on their first encampment 3 r_—_ a. young man of . small fortune, but his education and abilities, added to the connections he had formed in life, raised him to that estimation, which rank and fortune cannot always acquire. This connection, however, was but of a very temporary date; the regiment going soon after the first campaign into quarters at N in the I------ of W., ensign ------ soon commenced an acquaintance with a young lady of the first family and collateral fortune in that ifland, with whom he took a matrimonial trip to the continent; the parents of the lady were soon reconciled to the match, and ensign ------ resigned his commission in the regiment, to be ready for such promotion as the extensive interest 'of 100 wii: 8 father was capable of procuring. him. | 

The father in law of Ensign - was the Reverend Mr. -----, nephew and heir to the late Lord -----, whose fortune and influence in the I----- of W is of that magnitude as to enable him, upon, his own foundation, to return five out of the six members that represent the three boroughs in that island in parliament; and this marriage taking place just at the eve of the last general election, ensign ------ was returned to represent one of these booughs, with a view no doubt of realizing that advantage which we daily see accumulated in parliamentry adventures. An opportunity soon offered. sir — A Nabob, glutted with the spoils of the cast, who had just lost his seat for s-----, was so anxious to get into another _» borough, it being the moment of enquiry in the H- 

of C-----s when the select committee was appointing to examine into the conduct of the Asiatic plunderers, that he was making offers of any terms, to get reinstated in that house. Ensign --- was applied to, and the bargain was compleated; he accepted the Chiltern hundreds, and sir „ who now represents that borough, was elected in his room. The terms upon which ensign ---- made this surrender, have not to a certainty transpired ; four thousand pounds was said to be the compliment, and a' church 

J Loving of three hundred a year. Ensign has, 

however, taken holy orders, and now enjoys a living of __ that ee. 

I W 8 was the next in the lady's graces. This young nobleman, who at that time was considered as one of the most dissipated of the age, was invited by sir Finical to spend a few days at his house at AL., and not having known lady Whimsy till his introduction to her "I sir Finical, which was about the time of ensign is marriage, there is every probable reason to suppose that the most trifling discretion on the part of sir Finical would have secured his head from any additional ornaments in this connection; but his lordship had syarce been half an hour in — house before lad; amen. who was taking a morning walk, passed by the window. Lord D..... was at that time viewing some pictures that hung up in the room, when fir Finical exclaimed **D...... D. ..! there she goes D..... ! is not she a divine creature? many young men have tried to seduce her; however you are welcome ta have your turn." Lord D..... accordingly accepted the complaisant offer, and the next morning at four o'clock sir "_ found him in lady Whimsy's bed-chamber. Ha, , (exclaims the cuckold) what brought you here?"

| 55 bee custom I have of walking in my sleep," replies the noble gallant. A hearty laugh succeeded, and they parted in reciprocal good humour. Lord D.. .. remained ten days longer upon this visit, during which time he had frequent returns of his unfortunate habit, of walking in his seep. His Lordship had not departed from A. .. three days before lady Whimsy was taken ill, and obliged to set off for town to consult her physician : the reached the A.... Inn at G....... in s........ the first night of her journey, and by the merest accident in the world overtook Lord D.. . 1 who had got no further on his return to London; his lordship immediately sent a message by her servant to acquaint her with the accident, politeness obliged her Ladyship to | see him, and the friendship he bore to sir Finical, compelled him to pay the same attention to his lady as he would Have done to his own. Bed rooms were prepared for the parties on _ fame floor, and next day ey PIP" thei | Journey, to London together. 

On Lady Whimsy's return to A. . ..., Captain B. . .., who was just then returned from his travels, was introduced to her ladyship by sir Finical, as a young gentleman through whose interest the B...... expected to overpower the parliamentary influence of the Rev. Mr. H. ..., by whose friendly assistance sir Finical was returned member for N..... Captain B.. . . had a vote in this borough, and with his <= F% that of another gentleman, (sir W.. .. . O. . . . .) sir Finical had little doubt of grasping the borough into his own hands. Lady Whimsy, though, unfortunately for sir Finical, was no _ politician. Love had alone engrossed all her powers, and the was as incapable of seconding his deep schemes, as he was of fathoming her's. sir Finical was always pointing out to the Captain the great honours and rewards that were to be procured by a little parliamentary management, and the advantages that would arise to both of them, by monopolizing the borough of N....... He instanced his own distinguished fortune in politics, who had been deemed. a numpskull in the country, and not thought to possess that quantum of understanding which. would: complete- a country Justice of the Peace; but: ke no sooner got into Parliament, than he was promoted to places worth ten thousand pounds a year, and appointed one of his . .. s most honourable P.. . C...... All this instruction, however, was like Don Quixotte _ explaining knight errantry to sancho Pancho, and made about as much impression. Lady Whimsy was on the contrary initiating him into the arcana of love, in which science he was not only an apt scholar, but soon became a thorough adept-in the rape as well as the ne of 

the e en n 

sir Finical, as we e have already ered had never a particle of jealousy i in his. composition. Coming rather abruptly into the company of his brother officers, he one day found Lady Whimsy fitting on the Captain" s knee, which so far from irritating or provoking the least resentment or anger in the breast of sir Finical, he accosted the Captain with all the good humour imaginable, « you know Lady Whimsy. loves you, B. . .., but you should not take liberties before company, because it will make idle and censorious people talk." Lady Whimsy, however, was not to be so easily intimidated. The censure or praise of, the idle of the world Was s alike indifferent to her. oP

distracted at the thought of; he one day laid a wager with Lord C.. .. that his Lordship would himself acknowledge Lady, Whimsy,to be the finest proportioned man in Europe, and he promised to contrive a method by which Lord C....... should be able to determine the bet. sir Finical accordingly. communicated the 047m. to his lady; her ladyship laughed at the jest, and the next morning Was fixed for his lordship to make his decision. In the morning lady Whimsy rung for Betty; Betty was ordered to carry her Ladyship's cloaths into the parlour, and hang them over a screen by the fire. La, ma'am, (lays Betty) why will your Ladyship dress i in the parlor, when it! is so | you into the secret, (repited her Pr 4 sir Finical has laid a wager with 858. that I am the finest woman naked he ever saw in his life; fo you are to hang my cloaths over a | screen i in the parlour, and Tam to wash and dress.

But (says Betty) your lady ship won't dress before Lord C. 0 6 no, sir Finicat will cohtrive that, (replies her Ladyship). * C., and he are to get into the book cafe, and I am not to know they are watching me. Good | God ! (exclaims Betty) T would not for the world?" hd your tongue you fool (says her ladyship), it is sir Finical's whim, and I must comply with, it." Accordingly she de- a into the Ts: 9 5 having cleared the "mw and there presented herself nearly in the same manner as Venus appeared before Paris when he determined the golden prize. Her Ladyship was resolved to give the umpire a fair opportunity of making an impartial decision, and for that purpose displayed, herself in the several postures, which the nicest virtuoso could have required: first sitting in front of the book case to draw on her stockings, and then setting her foot on the chair with her back the same way, to tie on her garters. His Lordship confessed his wage lost, and sir Finical and his Lady - had a hearty naher at the en up of the _ a

Betty, therefore, became gilt to this innocent indulgence, and sir Finical and his Lady seemed to coincide in the mutual resolution of accommodating themselves to each other's. ruling whim. One morning Betty observed a strange face introduce itself through the hole. she immediately alarmed her Lady. Her Ladyship rather seemed diverted at the jest. Betty screamed out. The mistress of the bath came'to her assistance. Lady Whimsy laughed. By this time Betty had huddled on her cloaths, and sallied out with Mrs. ...... to discover the impudent obwader, It was Captain B....... standing upon sir Finical's shoulders. Betty burst into a loud laugh; sir Finical and Captain B. , did the same. Mrs. ., shook. her head.

Lady Whimsy, by this time came out of the bath, . and;

„ of... stands foremost among Wir number who have possessed an exclusive share of her partiality. But ; this connection was of the shortest duration. The hon. Mr. ....., brother to this nobleman, was always esteemed the foremost in ner affection ; indeed his temporary seperation, when he was ordered for America, had almost proved fatal to her Ladyship. she presented him with her wedding ring when they parted, as an earnest of her violent attachment. The 

Cuptall i of the M.. ..., succeeded Mr. This gentleman Was member of the late parliament sor ' saudiayifand possesses an estate equal if not superior to most gentlemen in that county. His generosity and hospitality, has placed him in the highest esteem among his county neighbours, and his person, and address, has procured him an equal interest among the ladies. His original name E Was

sir s. 8... , another captain in the same regiment, entered the list of her gallants last summer. This young gentleman lately succeeded to the title -of his father, the late sir s........ s. . .., with a very small fortune. He is however a distinguished favorite among the ladies, and as such could not but Bold. a distinguished place in lady Whimsy's esteem. . 1 

The Honorable Mr. ee n OF Lord . commenced acquaintance with her ladyship in town, Mr. ... is of that fashionable cast who spend their fortunes before they succeed to them, and was what the polite world terms done up above a twelvemonth ago. This gentleman had the singular good luck to be re-elected member for a C...... at the last general election, because his. constituents could. find person one to oppose him. His father is deemed the proudest man in England, and has given a ridiculous proof of the predominance of his passion, by expending his fortune in a fruitless attempt to outvie his neighbour; the Duke of .., in the grandeur and magnificence of his house, and now has recourse to the usual expedient, a short allowance and a | ee to recruit his finance. 


The Earl ........ cuts no rncdnkderable. figure in the history of her amours. This young nobleman possesses an estate of 14,000l. a year, and has stood bene in the world of gallantry for some years; his generosity, attachment and inviolable secrecy, where love and honour are concerned, has acquired him that reputation among fashionable ladies which none of his predecessors could ever attain to. Besides which, he has long since acquired the character of a Hercules in the field of love, which contributes in no small degree to the envied estimation in which * always been held.

When this nobleman first became acquainted with lady Whimsy, his absence was insupportable; a confirmed melancholy took possession of her mind, and even the whims of poor sir Finical had no longer the power of diverting her. His fondness however was so great for the dejected lady, that he took the certain method of removing her, complaint, and it became at last a familiar custom with sir Finical, when he found her melancholy fit coming upon her, to, send for C........ to divert her, and these di. versions at last became fo frequent, as to raise the envy and spleen of all the frail hiterhood at the happiness, of the poor dejected lady.

The honourable Colonel N. . was another in the list of her ladyship's humble servants, but there was nothing exceeding the common adventures of gallantry in this intrigue, except sir Finical thinking himself honoured by the connection.
