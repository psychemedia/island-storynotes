INTRODUCTION.

THE honor of a man with respect to his wife has been, in ancient as well as modern times held so sacred, that some incidents in the following history, will scarcely be credited by posterity, though they stand upon such authentic record, as requires no arguments at this hour to support them. The Athenians and Romans were equally jealous of their wives fidelity, and Caesar said that his wife should not only be virtuous but even unsuspected. In modern times we find, the chastity of a woman has ever been considered as the greatest ornament of her sex, and which has invariably held her revered in the society of the world, and that even the professed seducer has almost constantly despised the frailty of a woman who could yield to his intreaties, though for a moment it has made him supremely happy. In Turkey the constancy of even concubines is most rigidly guarded, and nothing bearing the resemblance of men, except eunuchs, are permitted to gain admission to their presence. At this refined period, when our understandings are so compleatly cultivated, and our manners so polished and refined, that the slightest injury is construed into an affront of so heinous a nature, that nothing but life can atone for it; will it not appear astonishing that a man of rank, family and considerable fortune, should not only connive at, but be instrumental in his wife's infidelities.

Heroditus tells us, that it was the custom among the Persians, to have several fairs in the kingdom at which all the young unmarried women were annually exposed to sale; the men who wanted wives came thither to purchase them, and they were disposed of to the highest bidder. But that author does not tell us that they were ever disposed of again; or that, though the females who were purchased might frequently be wedded against their inclination, they ever proved unfaithful to their conjugal engagements. It is astonishing, that in this country, where no woman can be purchased or married against her will, we should so frequently find causes for separations and divorces. There appears but one cogent reason for those infidelities, which must be some defect on the part of the husband, which was not discerned till after marriage, and we think that to remove this evil, the custom which we are assured prevails in Wales, might be introduced in England with great success; which is stiled BUNDLING. This ceremony we are informed consists of the intended bride and bridegroom being put to bed together with their cloaths on, when if the bride discovers any apparent deficiency, she is intitled to decline the match, and the intended husband has no other redress than to endeavour seeking for another wife, who is either not so judicious as the lady who rejected him, or is not so extravagant in her expectations. To this cause we may, probably ascribe the constancy that reigns in that principality, where a divorce is a circumstance scarcely ever heard of. It may, however, be objected to this plan, that our puny race of nobility, who are frequently emaciated before they think of matrimony, would stand a very indifferent chance of getting wives, after a state of probation; but though this might in some cases prove a great disappointment, to individuals, who by shaking their elbows, have put their estates out of the elbows, and have no other chance left than conferring a title, in exchange for a good fortune; the community would be no sufferers by such disappointments, and the rising generation might be considerable gainers, by the ladies being properly married, though to men without coronets, which are often the certain indexes of future horns, to those who might approve themselves able-bodied husbands and indubitable fathers.

How far the *great hero* of this *little tale* was qualified to become a father, (though we are told he has adopted two children as legitimate) we will not pretend to determine; but if a judgment might be formed from appearances, his athletic figure and manly exterior, might prejudice a woman in his behalf without *bundling*. But we must acknowledge, that whether from sordid motives, which is scarce credible, or from a depravity of sentiment, or conscious inability he appears to have acted upon principles that would have disgraced a Turk; for we are told from good authority, it is not the custom to speak to them of their women, and it would be as improper to ask a Turk, how his wife did, as with us it would be to desire to see our neighbour's wife naked. What then must we say of a man, who could not only listen to various conversations concerning his wife, but so far from refusing to let his wife be seen in *puris natuaralibus*, be the promoter of such an exhibition, and hoist a rival on his shoulders to see her bathing, declaring he would shew him the finest made woman in England? This will appear in the course of the subjoined *historiette*; but we do not mean this as a vindication of the lady's conduct, which will appear, if not so culpable as his, at least highly reprehensible.

Let a husband be ever so vicious or abandoned, it is no excuse for a wife to yield to the dictates or connivance of such a man, as would betray her honour. She had a just right to complain of his behaviour upon various occasions; but it appears to have been congenial with her disposition; and instead of resenting the injuries offered her by him, in which she would have been strictly meritorious; the seems to have availed herself of his improper conduct, by seizing any opportunity of gratifying her vicious inclinations.

We think this lady at least merits the punishments inflicted upon incontinent females at East and West Emborne, in the county of Bucks; which we shall relate as recorded in those admirable papers, The Spaectators.

> "If a customary tenant dies, the widow shall have what the law calls her *free-bench* in all his copyhold lands *dum sola casta fuerit*, that is, whilst she lives single and chaste; but if she commits incontinency she forfeits her estate; yet if she will come into the court riding backward upon a black ram, with his tail in her hand, and say the words following, the steward is bound by the custom to readmit her to her free bench.
>
> 'Here I am, ne; Riding upon a black ram,  
> 'Like a whore as I am;  
> 'And for my *crincum crancum*,  
> 'Have lost my *bincum bancum*;  
> 'And for my tail's game,  
> 'Have done this worldly shame;  
> 'Therefore, I pray you, Mr. Steward, let me have my land again.'"

Probably if this custom were adopted in the county of Middlesex, as well as the county of Bucks, 
as well for wives as widows, *bucks-horns* would not be so prevalent, and such numerous antlers stare us in the face (for husbands have left off wearing their horns in their pockets, they are now of such an enormous size) in all quarters of this metropolis, and we find that the infection has spread to the county of Hants, and even to the immaculate isle of Wight or *Vectis* itself.

*On the  fortuitous concourse of Atoms.*

ACCORDING to some philosophers, and philosophers as lovers of wisdom, must be credited, there is upon many occasions a fortuitous concourse of atoms, an assemblage of particles of matter that may either constitute a man, or a monster, an angel, or a devil. In this opinion we are inclined to think that a certain baronet, who happened to be *put together* in this *strange manner* in the East Riding of Yorkshire, was jumbled into what he has since approved himself.

By a parity of reasoning we are also disposed to surmise that a certain lady, his lawful, wedded, just and honoured wife, who drew her first breath nearly in the same vicinity, by some contagion or influence of the air in that peculiar soil, was engendered, brought forth, and has since appeared a paragon of —————— imaginary virtue.

But much is to be said on the score of Love, and Hudibras has told us,

> "Lovers hearts, are not their own heart,  
> "Nor lungs, nor lights and so forth downwards."

His worshipful worship—, who has lately established his own character, reputation and caprices in the world, received his education at a grammar school, when the accidence were regularly flogged into him, and

> "Having got from possum to posset,  
> "He there was gravelled, and could no further get."

Her ladyship was placed at a polite boarding school, where in the hour of relaxation from more severe studies, she red *Les Bijoux Indiscrets*; the* Memoirs of a Woman of Pleasure*, and several other books equally calculated for improving her morals, and cultivating. the fine-feelings of her mental powers.

cherished his acquaintance on ac8:

and he was soon after introduced at court, where he met with a gracious reception, it being at the eve of a general election, and his parliamentary Interest was much desired.

It may be supposed that he entered into all the gay amusements of the polite world, as he had a taste for = dress as well as dissipation ; but he could never be prevailed upon to play for any considerable sum, as he had received some useful lessons from an uncle, who in his juvenile days had been a considerable sufferer, by following the _ of the late Lord Chesterfield, with whom he was very intimate, and for whom he entertained so high an opinion, on account of his wit and abilities, that he thought it impossible for him to err.

From this uncle, who was an old bachelor, he also received another piece of useful advice, for though he did not fay with old Acafto i in the Orphan,

From this motive, our hero was now of age, and had become possessed as well of his fortune as title, rejected many overtures which had been indirectly made him, to give his hand at the altar of Hymen. Some matches which were offered to him might have been esteemed very elegib dle, and it is not astonishing, for as it has already been remarked in the introduction, that he was a stout personable man, was possessed of an estate of near three thousand a year, and could confer the title of lady, to any female with whom he PEGRINR uni2 Oe

en: that maids and widows of 3 most every description, should be left to his choice, But the one thing needful always preponderated with him, and as he knew from the nature of his connections and acquaintance, that he might almost command a: co- N heiress, with upwards of seventy thousand pounds, so soon as she came of 1 5 ae, he 1 era in ambush, either for her or something more weighty. A plumb, doubtless, would have prevailed, though busy fame might have tickled the reputation of his bride in a more teazing manner, than it had done that of Miss F.

* Two years were still to expire,

Although we have intimated that "he was no great classic scholar, let it not be imagined that he was destitute of the rudiments of either English or French; he could write the first tolerably well, as a late history which he has produced may testify, and as to the Gallic tongue, if he spoke it not fluently, he acquitted himself, at least with so much facility, as b : to make bimself easily.understood.

Their charms had sufficient power to conquer his virtue, when his landlady having from his servant obtained a knowledge of his intended visit across the way, she waited upon our hero, and gave him: such cautions as induced him to forego the expected pleasures he had promised himself. Luckily for him this advice came very apropos, for that night a man was murdered in the house, where he was found after the ladies and their bravoes had decamped, naked, ind of course luft of all he had been rod of.

In a few days he embarked on board a Tuscan vessel, bound for the Morea and the Archipelago. He anchored and landed at the first island, formerly called Cytherea, now named Cerigo.

arrived in town, and placed at a relation's house. She was a lady upon the haut ton, gave routs, received masks on public nights, and esteemed a woman of taste and elegance in all polite companies,

Under such a tutoress, we may readily suppose our heroine soon approved herself an apt scholar. She read Hoyle with the greatest attentiop, and was so much resolved upon learning a speedy adept in the circle of his sciences, that she had him bound like a prayer-book, which she constantly took with her to church, and prayed most fervently upon every occasion, It 1s true she did not pay much attention either to the text or the sermon, let the latter have been ever so good; but if her thoughts were not employed in calculating the nearest road to heaven, she certainly was very assiduous in calculating the 8 odds at whist and piquet, and the most dexterous method of securing a pool at quadrille,

Thus instructed she soon figured Y capital hand in most assemblies, and was particularly distinguished in the rooms at Bath, as well for her personal charms, as her sent card abilities.

However, the captain having won one night a considerable sum of Mr. Bi at the tuns, the captain pocketed the real, as well as imaginary affront, and no farther notice was taken of being the captain's rival.

This much was notorious to all Bath, that he played very deep with men whole characters were at least doubtful, and that he was seldom successful.

From these considerations our heroine was induced to reject his addresses, though his importunities were incessant for an eclairci isememt.

Lord D- -, another of her admirers, was not to be dismissed in this manner; for though she attempted to play the same game upon him, for reasons lomewhat similar, he declared the points Miss F mentioned as obstacles to their union, should be no bar to his felicity, if she would vouchsafe to give him her consent, and he would set off next morning for London, wait upon her guardian, ; and have a categorical answer from him respecting that business, His . lordship

UR heroine had scarce returned to the metropolis before a

1 ball was advertised at the Pantheon,

1 Pantheon. Her kinswoman received masks that night at her own house, About two in the morning she was persuaded to make one of a party to goto the Temple of the Gods, as she was already equipt in a shepherdess' habit. She had scarce joined in this motly groupe before she was accosted by a gentleman in a domino who claimed her acquaintance, and reminded her of some circumstances that had passed whilst she was at Bath. She soon discovered it was Lord 1 who acquainted her of his Journey, and informed her he had not only met with a very polite reception from her guardian, but the strongest assurances of his interest and protection, His lordship was going on at this rate when she found herself jostled in a circle, who soon brought her to the door, where in spite of all her remonstrances she was forced into a chair and conducted to a Hotel in that neighbourhood.

In this extraordinary dilemue she knew not what step to take. In vain, she let down the glass and endeavoured to remonstrate with the chairman, he was deaf to all her intreaties, and upon her arrival at the hotel she found Lord D. with two associates ready to receive her.

she was conducted to an apartment, where Lord — attended her alone, when baving fastened the door; he began in quite a different tone from what he had ever before addressed her. Madam, you are now in my power; but I shall take no advantage of this situation to make any attacks upon your, virtue, on condition you sign this paper; you have already verbally promised me your hand in marriage, provided I could obtain the consent of your guardian; this I have accomplished, and, therefore, you can have no farther excuse for refusing to comply with my request."

saying this, pen and ink having been previously prepared, he pulled out a pistol, and finding her entirely averse to his proposal, said "you must do this or take the consequences, for I will not be trifled with."

Miss F— ; now fell on her knees, and imploted his mercy, begging time to consider of what he proposed, 5 for that at present she was so terrified and agitated at what had passed, and her hand shook so much that it would be impossible to sign her name ever to be recognized. HIER

This expostulation had no effect, and he had already dragged her to the bed, and was upon the point -of throwing her upon it, saying it that was the case, he would have his revenge another way; when her shrieks were heard in an adjacent room, where a gentleman rushed from Re. : arms of his Thais and taking his ; word, burst open the door.

 Lord D—— was so surprised or facinated at his unexpected appearance, that he forgot his pistol which still lay on the table, and which Miss 2

Our heroine was at this period under such a state of embarrassment, and so overwhelmed with gratitude for herrescue, that she answered many interogatories in such 2 manner as gave him the most promising hopes of succeeding in his addresses; more es- - ally as he had now no rival to oppose

Then, after a few days you must return into Yorkshire, and he must be informed that step was taken also by the advice of your physician, for the benefit of the change of air, which he judged would be the most conducible thing towards the e of mw health,


This recommendation met our heroine's approbation, and as to retiring to rest it was a thing she much

stood in need of, considering the agitation her spirits had just undergone, and the want of repose till now. This resolution being agreed to, Miss F. — retired to her apartment, where she had not been long before the nw _ at the door.

However, all external appearances were kept up, and no one judged there was the least misunderstanding between the baronet and her ladyship. A short time afterwards she proved pregnant, and though this might have seemed a farther cement "ui conjugal affection, it did not appear to operate that way, This pledge of their mutual affections, as we should suppose it, did not seem to restore that fondness that at first reigned between them. He roamed at large, under the priviledge of the caudle

month, and when that was expired, she was seen coquetting in all gay assemblies in the polite circles, and associating with professed Demi repts, whole characters were as dubious as their complexions.

The world now began to talk freely of her ladyship, and the baronet seemed to laugh at the scandal. This conduct on both sides encouraged many young fellows of fashion to think her ladyship was among the number of Come-atables, and they laid their plans accordingly.

Amongst the foremost of her lovers whom we find she now elected to be revenged of her husband' s infidelity, we meet with the Honourable Charles W=nd- h—m, Esq. Their first and last interview we are informed was in and near Kensington-Gardens. There is a very commodious house not far distant from the palace, where any loving couple may, without ceremony, sacrifice at the altar of the Cytherean goddess. Here we discover they often repaired; and the lovers devotions were so fervent and sincere, so satisfactory and gratifying, that her ladyship made frequent appointments with bim to return to this temple, ; and renew with vigour thoie successful invocations of the goddess's aid; which he n never failed complying with. "This agreeable intercourse continued several months, when greatly to her ladyship's mortification, this gentleman was called abroad. In their last interview, to testify her fondness, her friendship and esteem, she presented him, as a token of remembrance of those happy hours of amourous dalliance, which they had so often experienced, her ring, her wedding ring; which at once dif. played the most lively idea she entertained of Mr. W—nd—bm, and the "sovereign contempt in which she held her husband : nay more, she took it off her OWn finger and put it upon his, to signify that it might be there rivetted, as she wished her image to his heart.

This parting Was tender to the highest degree, and their devotions to the Cyprean goddess surpassed all belief; N and repeatedly,

They were all choice spirits, : and after dinner, the usual bumpers having circulated, catches and glees began, and continued till midnight, when every man carried off near four bottles of claret to bed, and about two in the morning they retired to rest,"

sir Richard had paid his devotions fo copiously at the shrine of Bacchus, being president, that his company as bed-fellow became quite disagreeable, more particularly as he snored most intolerably. Her ladyship was accordingly, obliged. to rise and retire, it is supposed to her maid's s apartment to pass the remainder of the morning. There is some reason, however, to suspect she mistook the chamber door, and through mistake went into that of Lord 4—. What gave rise to this opinion was, that in the morning, when the rest of the gentlemen were prepared to go on a shooting party, as had been agreed upon the night before, his lordship feigned being taken very ill, and desired to be excused from accompanying them,

Her ladyship, with her wonted benevolence, like another lady Bountiful, made him some sack, whey, carried it to him herself, and attended by his bed side, at least, to anticipate his wants. In this situation, sir Richard Easy returning from shooting, found Lady Wagtail, upon which occasion he highly extolled her n and tendernesss. Being so well nursed, and by such an agreeable attendant, his lordship soon recovered, but we find he had a relapse of the same complaint two days after, when Lady Wagtail failed repeating her good offices; she, indeed, exerted her abilities to afford Lord A all the comfort in her power. 88 B— called this, a relapse, without virtue being in danger."

It must be wid that captain th viewed these attentions and assiduities 5 with a jealous eye, and he resolved i in turn to be taken 5 in order to try .

but he was agreeably diese of the contrary, and he found that she as eagerly sought to afford Him relief, as she had done Lord A- in turn became jealous of the captain, whose complaint seemed to be of longer duration than his had been.

With what success he carried on this traffic of love, we will not determine, for as he had now descended to mere Grizettes for the lake of economy, we cannot suppose chat in this lottery of venus he was a successful adventurer, Indeed, if we may suggest from his freqnent visits to a certain surgeon near Pall-mall, when he had neither sprained his ancle, or dislocated hisshoulder, that some other complaint, which required chirurgical aid, induced him to ring so often at at certain bell.

We will, however, do justice to our hero, so far as to assert with tolerable good authority, that he acted like a man of honour upon the occasion, and that Lady: Wagtail had no reason to complain of his irregularities in this respect.

Lady Wagtail hurried from one public diversion to another, and jaded with an incessant rou nd of pleasure, frequent vigils, and cyprian sports, Was desirous of recruiting her health and spirits, by a retreat into the country and she sets off for the Isle of Wight, leaving the unlucky Wight, her easy busband, to compleat his pharmaceutic course, and restore his health 1

\HE gay, the gallant p- 5 
Was at this time the 1 of the age. His person was tall and elegant, his countenance uncommonly pre-engaging, his conversation sprightly and vivacious.

We need not be suprised at the comeliness of his person, or the gracefulness of his figure, when we recollect he is the son of the celebrated Miss G—g, afterwards Lady Cy. : His lordship had already established his reputation for gallantry and intrigue, amongst the first rate demi-reps upon the ton, by whom he was usually called the male Gsuch: a lter a8 at t Lady Wagtail 1 could not fail of meeting with the most gracious reception, as the had long wished for a te 2 tôte with his lordship, whom she was ambitious of enrolling in the list of her chers amis; and never could a more favourable opportunity occur, as the sequel will evince, :

One evening over a bottle, Easy 5 fad to D —t; What do you think of her ladyship—ls not she a fine woman?“ To which his lordship replied, « Amazingly hand- hae". gad you would say lo,

continued sir 13 if vou were to see her naked,"

You are a very lucky man, resumed his lordship, to be in possession of such a treasure,"

"Why, look ye, D—t, I like to make my friends happy, as well as myself. Many fine fellows have sbeen at her, but without success I believe ; now Pl give 9 leave to take your chance with her,"

such an invitation, doubtless, ad not 8⁰ unaccepted; and his lordship was. accordingly found the next morning carly i in her ladyship's s dress5 W * sir Richard, where

Gods mer gods, and joRRled i in the dark. — —

Heavens, said the baronet, who is there!" "It is only me," said his lordship, "I am apt to walk in my sleep." Though by the bye he was found in a standing posture, and her ladyship hugging herself at the joke, that had given rise to this discovery. If the felt any mortification upon the coccasion, it was at having missed his lordship so soon, when she found he was so well qualified to renew the amorous attack; and could not avoid saying, she wished sir Richard had

W hee de Dre ... e 
T1407 himself walked a few minutes longer in his sleep."

The easy husband was not in the least displeased at his lordship's itinerant disposition under the influence of Morpheus; and that he might have more favourable opportunities of indulging his nocturnal perambulations, sir Richard intreated him to remain several successive days (and 5 nights of course) at his villa; during which time he had many tere d tote parties with her ladyship, in different excursions, where he failed not to make good the defalcation occasioned by Cornuto's not walking some time longer in his sleep. Among other places where these snug Tete a bete parties took place, southampton bore a repeated witness of their joys, as did afterwards Kingston and Godalmin ; the careless husband giving his lordship a fair chance with Lady Wagtail, who, sensible of the obligation she owed to sir Richard for this kind indulgence, did her best endeavours to spread his antlers as far as possible; and though they had already a very respectable appearance, they now out-stripped the decorations g

oo sI tions of all the cornuto's heads in the three kingdoms.

Her ladyship exerted bor abilities upon this occasion, doubtless, from principles of gratitude ; considering that all good offices should be mutual, or they can be of no long duration, In this respect her success was equal to her efforts, and sir Richard Easy might ere now sit down perfectly satisfied, that his character, as an affable, good-natured, obliging husband, was established beyond the power of fame, ill nature, or scandal, in any degree to diminish it.

Her ladyship, who now seemed to aim at universal conquest, was happy in the idea of having such an ad= mired Beau Gargon of his rank amongst the list of her sigbing swains.

for supposing Lord P—m, who succeeded this gentleman in his post of happiness, if not of fame, had however, we are well informed, more reason to complain of her ladyship's favours, than any of his predecessors; 
— might have been a little ee in his amours with Lady Wagtail, there is great cause to believe the marquis was, in e


the New Market phrase, deep i in for

the plate, At least this conclusion may, in part be drawn from Dr. O—ne's declaration at that peribd, with respect to Lady Wagtail's health, in August 1780, which nearly corresponds with the time when she so greatly honoured the marquis with her favours, and it's thought, left such an impression upon his body and his mind, as he did not soon forget.

We must again FEE short in our career, with regard to her ladyship 8 amorous connections, as they have already carried us on beyond our Intended limits, yet we cannot help noticing the behaviour; of sir Richard Easy, with regard to Mr. B—i'm—th., Lady Wagtail was in company with this gentleman, when they met Ealy in a phacton near shouter's Hill, and though he was required to accompany them he refused it, and rode towards town. That day nothing very material past in the transaction of the business of love; but there is no doubt that Mr. S—th, was amongst the number of her gallants, and that he shared her favours, in common, with her other adaurers, though he might not have had so much reason to remember her as Mr. W—

-m, to whom she gave her wedding ring, or Lord P— and the M—q—s of G- to whom she was still more liberal of her donations.

We are assured, that when the marquis upbraided her some time after with the treatment he had met

>; with" from her, and requested to know who was the cause of her present indisposition? she frankly replied, she would not be so unjust as to charge any individual with it as he might have been the Devil at


( 256 Y the masquerade, or one of his Imps in the Ifle of Wight.

It is somewhat remarkable, that the careless husband never once complained of any injury he had received from his faithless wife; a pretty certain proof that he had, by neglecting her charms, left family duty to be performed by substitutes, as well among the regulars as in the Militia.

The acquaintance, we find, between sir R— and the captain commenced last spring, and was occasioned by the purchase of an estate the baronet was desirous of making of him, which secured a borough. : Ia ne of this negociation,

Mr. B8 ek. and a good under- 1

- frequently visited at the

standing prevailed between him and the family. Some liberties the captain took with Lady Wagtail in the Presence of sir Richard might have sufficiently alarmed his jealousy, if he had been disposed that way ; but though the captain often pulled her Upon his lap and kissed her, in her husband's company, he seemed to treat it in a jocular manner. Nay, so far did the cornuto 0 from being Ut displeased with B— rs conduct, that some time after ber ladyship being at the cold bath at Maidstone, the end husband willing to display his wife's charms to o the greatest advantage, told B. -t he would shew him one of the finest naked women in England; and accordingly raised the captain upon his shoulders, that he might view her ladyship through an aperture or small window, which B——+t could not otherwise have reached. Upon this occasion one cannot help remarking, that not contented with being the sewer and cultivator of his own towering antlers, : he at length became the Arras of his own INFAMY.

But what can be surprisingi in the conduct of a husband who, upon receiving remonstrances from modest ladies, respecting the licentious behaviour of Lady Wagtail, r replied, with the greatest ufd imaginable,

TH) a nable, that Lady Wagtail liked it. The ladies naturally pittied him for beingtbe most easy contented cuckold in the world.

Neventidless, upon Mr. B a : elopement from Lewes with Lady Wagtail, the baronet, now first : offended at his wife's conduct, after making a great bustle at captain L—'s, where they had passed the evening, he went home, and in an aggregate fit of Jealousy for all her infidelities, which he doubtless this moment , and never before, began to suspect, he destroyed all her clothes, threw her miniature picture in the fire, broke her china, and when her ladyship arrived in town, at the Hotel in Pall-mall, she had nothing but her maiden blush to cover herself from shame and from her exposing those naked charms, which the now very wneasy husband, had often displayed to his ends, and particularly his present rival.

When Lady. Wagtail dfdf that the baronet had resolved to commence a prosecution against captain 
B—, and that he proposed laying his damages at 20,000l. She resolved to go all lengths to circumvent his design. Her character was already lost, her reputation facrificed, all her female connections destroyed; and the was determined now to make her husband appear, at least, as infamous as herself. She sent the Baronet a letter, in which she intimated if he persisted in his defign of prosecuting the Captain, he would only expose himself, and become the object of universal contempt and derision. At the same time she added a list of about three-score gallants, to whom she acknowleged having been perfectly liberal with her favours, of which he could not be ignorant, unless he had been more blind than a mole. She also inclosed Dr. O — account with the  recipes be had prescribed for her; and concluded with assuring him, if

be ail remained obslinate she hoot

commence a suit against him for the deficiency of her pin money which he had not regularly paid, and which had occasioned her to apply to many others for relief, tosum up the whole of this extraordinary history, Lady Wagtail and Captain B—t live very agreeably in Harley-street, Cavendish-square, where her frail name is inscribed upon Corinthian brass at the door: and poor Cornuto, since his defeat in Westminster-hall, has fled to hide himself from the world in the wilds of Hampshire.
