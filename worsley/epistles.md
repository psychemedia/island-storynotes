DEDICATION.

*

T O LADY WORSLEY. MAD A M, 1 ä 1 WHILST the hypocritical Prude and frozen-hearted Dame, censure your actions with the utmost acrimony, permit one of your old Admirers, to pay the tribute of admiration and applause, at the liberality of your manners. Your Ladyship has not only proved yourself an utter enemy to all amorous monopoly, but to every species of smuggling whatever; for your wares have always been laid open to every fair trader, and as fairly entered

in the Custom-house of VENus.

Born a Briton, you knew Liberty is your charter; and that you had no right 15 to submit to the Dominion of any one man upon earth. From your extensive Commerce with the Male sex, your Ladyship must be well skilled in the quality of every Cyprean commodity, from the Marquis down to the Militia-man. The Irish shzlaley, the scotch Hir, and the English

Methinks I see you there, amidst a circle of the Apollos of all Nations, and your Ladyshi p engaged in the delightful ceremony, of throwing the Handkerchief Were such an Institution once begun, we would behold many fasnionable Dames of this Country, following your Ladyship's example; and it would certainly meet with

the sanction, nay. encouragement of Government, as the Naval Trade, in supply-

DEDICATION.

Your Ladyship being such a lover of the Male sex, to whom then could men properly Dedicate the following poetical Whim than to Lady Worsley! It having been handed about, among the polite circles, for these several weeks, and said to be written by Lady. I am happy in thus introducing it to the Public, and the Patronage of your Ladyship.

Although the /abjef on which it was founded be very obscure, yet as it is remarkable for a delicacy of thought and expression, it would have been a very great loss to the world, had it not been published May your Ladyship's seraglio be soon established; and may you ever be as happy as you have afforded momentary happiness to others.

DEDICATION.

LADY WORSLEY.

MADAM,

9 find a wide Alteration from the usual Style of Dedications. The Idea which is

I  generally understood in penning these Compositions, is to dwell upon the Character, and enumerate the Actions of the Persons addressed, attended with a long Train of Panegyrics, and lay out a considerable Space in forming elegant Compliments.

But your Ladyship has ee me 10

deviate from this general Mode. You have sustained a Character which cannot possibly be commented upon but with the utmost

severity. Vou have accustomed yourself in

the ene of Actions, since your first 5 . of —_— that cannot be related without e the delicate ers of Modesty. .

Your Ladyship has l it in my Power to display here a horrid Picture of Infamy. You who have ran thro' all the changes and vicissitudes of Dissipation have openly plunged yourself into the Gulph of Camal Variety,

Reluctance.

DETEsTED Man! of all thy sex the worst,  
As I of mine the most completely curst;  
To thee I write, no fullieo to confess,  
The past I own, nor wish the future less.

What though for thee I'm styl'd, in ev'ry page,  
The Messalina of the present age;  
Be it my praise, my chief delight, to own,  
Of all mankind I love not thee alone.  
This truth let D——t, P———h, tell;  
For them I lov'd, I alas *fear*, alas too well:  
Yet when another; and another came,  
The *object* alter'd, the *desire* the same;  
I strictly followed Nature's liberal plan,  
And what she gave to me, bestow'd on Man.  
Blame on, ye Prudes! Aud censure those who may,  
I'm quite regardless what the world can say.


„% +: oath Let blushing Maids found once, alas too frail,  
In blubb' ring accents tell the doleful tale   
„ With words ambiguous half the fact reveal,  
With sighs and sobs the other half conceal :  

How much they shrugghd ere they were undone,  
But let the RUINs well-experienc'd Dame  
Enjoy the pleasure, and despise the shame;  
Pant for fresh scenes of unrestrain'd delight,  

_ Wish the I past, and long: again for night: :  
Virtue's a theme that idle girls may learn, LIAN: .  

But fit for women such as these to spurn.  

Tell the false oaths by which their bans were Won,  

And babe chat I &er such as these prefide,  
Direct their councits, and their Alone guide  
Nor deem it wrong that W's Wise should reign,  
Where Vice in Impudence compose the train,  
Here G—R, L——R, and Aux, meet,  
Me . their head, and Virtue at their feet:  
Here J—y R—---x and 8— repair,  

With many others of the amorous fair,  

All these, at midnight, met in close divan,  

Plan future schemes of happiness with Man;  
Their wishes gratify at all expence,  

And bid adieu to Decency and gense:  

Free and as nm as the air we rove,  
And deal to all who ask, a share of love;  
Yield, quickly yield, or stay not to be prest,  
And all caressing, are by all carest.  

such is the Wife whom Fortune made you wed,  
Who ths your name, as he detests your bed;  
And must I live; yet breathe this vital air;  

And must I then this name for ever bear?  
Yet, thanks to fate the name remains alone,  

For all the duties of a Wife are flown!  

From thee, tis true, I fled, in hopes to find  

A pleasure equal to | my lustful Wo  

Long time, alas! unsatisfy' d I rang'd,  

Now pleas'd with W—M, now for — chang'd;  
At length with B——T stopt, for he could give  

What from thine arms I could receive.  

From be no teizing titillations came;  

He rais'd or passions which he well could tame,  

Dissolv'd in thrilling extacy we lay,  

Kiss d till che morn, then curs'd the coming " - þ  

Oh! had you seen me on his been reclin'd;  

Lips glu'd to lips, and lijabe with limbs entwin'd:  

With oft repeated acts of dalliance spent,  
My lust cults sated, and my heart content.  
Then had you vainly curst th' inconstant charms  
That gave me once a Virgin to thine arms.  
But sure those charms you cannot justly blame,  
For wer't not Tuov the author of thy shame r  
Tr could possess thy brain,  

What madness W  
To help a Wife to an admiring swain?*  

| say did you think, or all my beauties gone,  
pl 5 were they but resery'd for thee alone?  

* Alluding to the affair at Ffaidflone-Bath.  

He fince has sworn, that, naked as I stood;  
He thought me Venus ris'n from the flood.  
Nor did I strive, for fear that you would chide;  
The least, the smallest of my charms to hide:  
Without a blush I gave him time to gaze,  
And set his youthful spirits in ablaze  
Not so chaste Dian by Acteon seen.  
What J expos' d, be most contriv'd to screen:  
But lest to her souls crimes he should impute,  
% Wear horns from hence, she yd, and be a brute."  
such, B— too had been thy hapless fate, pee,  

And such th'effect of married woman's hate.  

But since not your s, but W———ry's Was the fault,  
I gaye to him the benoure which he fought;  
And may he long such glorious honours wear,

„ Who live in Drary-lane or Grofo'nor snare!  
- And ye, my sex when Husbands are the cause" Mi l

Pursue the path which I've so nobly trod,  
And shew no dread of punishment, or Gd!

I hate the mean, the paltry, grov ting foul,

Let Liberty, dear Liberty, our ways direct,  

And Prudence those she pleases may inspect.  

Perhaps, in some seraglio's dismal glooth,  
some hapless Patima laments her doom;  
Perhaps some solitary wretch complains,  

And tells to heav'n alone her inward pains;  

Torn from the youth the dearly, foridly lov'd;

With pomp surrounded, impotently gay,  
In groans she spends the night, in tears the day

And if she fails some willing youth to find,  
Why then a Husband caters. ta her mind.  

she scorns your impotent Italian Beaux,  
And loves intrinsic worth, nat tinsel clothes.  

Fly far from hence, ye Fops! not worth my care,  

Who only serve to tantalize the Fair ;  

Whose Joy it is to flutter at a play,  
Keen the news or scandal of the day;  
Tell how Lord M, with Lady C, was caught

O F  

R— D WW——.  

Thou, whom our young nobles hail divine,  

Unrivall'd priestess at Priapus' shrine, vo  

Immortal Wx, or if yet more dear 3  

The name of Messalina greet thine ear, |  

Attend, and let thy suppliant husband move  
Compassion's tear, if not connubial love.  
Let Bx fondly clasp thee in his arme.  
Pant on thy breast, and riot in thy charms;  
Let the whole camp, and Pioneers, and all  
Taste thy sweet body, then insatiate call  
The Irish volunteers to grace thy bed,  
And add fresh antlers to thy husband's head ;  
But oh! forbear t' invoke the sacred Nine!  
Wit in each word, and aatire in each line ;  
Thy pointed numbers swell our mutual shame,  

And damn us both to never dying fame.  

The Grub - street syrens, who so often sing,  

The dauntless heroes that at Tyburn swing,  

Now strain their hackney'd throats with —Y's name,  

And W——-r's crimes, and W——-y's verse proclaim.  

say, what impassion'd Captain, what fond Lord,  

Amongst the numbers that attend thy board,  

Taught thee to deal in metaphor and trope,  
To rival Prior and to mimic Pope?  

For Lords, though vain of their pre-eminence,  

Have small concern with wit, and less with sense;  

And Captains, *tis allow'd, may sometimes fight,  
Game, bully, drink, and swear—but never write,  
Methinks I now descry thy wanton spark,  

Thy Pegasus, a spruce attorney's clerk;  

He pleads the curses of an empty purse,  

And pays thy favors, not with gold---but verse,  
Oh! for thy poet's sake, be patient then;  

Ride not so fast, nor mar the young clerk's pen;"  
But send him with the quill behind his ear,  

Before his angry master to appear.  

Thy letter to recall in vain I try, TON LIT ss Ab i  

since words once past irrevocably fly".  

What then remains to vindicate my fame,  

And fave from slander's tangue my injur'd name?  
Too late I now complain---the fatal dart  
Grows to my side, and rankles in my heart r. .  
The whisper'd tale escapes from ear to car,  
Lurks in a smile, and wounds me in a sheer.  
say, coud'st thou not clandestinely Gn,  
A world of wickedness, and me permit,

$4.  
The destin'd horns, unknowing and unknown,  
Like many husbands, to have tamely borne?  
Was' t not enough that at a public bar,  

My follies reign'd, the food of ev'ry ear?  

That as the leader of the cornute band,  


Wr presides, no rival in command?  
That this vain W——M, P——xr prove,  

And proudly boast thee as the wreck of love?  
Nor these suffice, but wilt thou dare to blame  
Me as the author of thy public shame?  

Urge me in print with vaunting terms to shew,  

Whence, from what secret impulse it could flow,  

That I, th' acknowledg'd guardian of thy fame,  

should, like a pander, prostitute thy name,  

And at a public bath in open day,  

To the wild gaze of youth thy charms display?  

"What madness, dost thou say, could fire my brain,  
"To help a wife to an admiring swain?"  

What madness rather seiz d me, when I led ©  

Thy virgin footsteps to the nuptial bed?  

The nuptial bed, where first thy powers I try'd,  
No wanton thought, no am'rous wish deny'd."  
Then death on death in quick succession came,  
You each attack receiv'd with double flame ;  

And oft' intreated to pursue the race,  
In vain I gently shunn'd the loath'd embrace.  
(O curs'd embrace, be ever curs'd those charms,  
That brought thee first a virgin to my arms!)  
Again I try'd the combat to sustain,  
Then first essay'd, but first essay'd in vain,  
Exhausted, spent, unequal to the fight,  
I wish'd the morn, and curst the ling'ring night.  
Were great Alcides now enjoin'd to prove  
With thee the fronive dalliance of love,  
Th' athletic son of Jove would soon retreat,  

And leave at last one labor incomplete.  

E'en Jove himself with all his boasted pow'r,  

"Might rise a swan, or fall a golden show'r,"  

Invent new modes his boundless lust to feast, -  

And change from god to man, from man to beast ;  

still would'st thou tire thro' ev'ry vary'd shape,  

| Th' immortal ravisher, and bless the rape.  

955 Pity that gods no longer now descend,  
Our feeble mortal efforts to befriend ;  
Their aid divine would lengthen cuckolds' bes:  
GRAHAM would find them beds, and Mapan wives;  
A god-like ow; impatient of controul,  

Would bear the BRITIsH name from pole to pole;  

Like PILLIr's war-like son, this world would find, ky  
For conq'ring arms, too narrow, too confin'd. —Y  

But, sad reverse! Behold our modern Beaux!  

Their worth consists in nothing——but their cloaths,  
shall such vain things, the mushrooms of the day,  

With gods presume to vie in am'rous play?  

say, Wx, are they men? their looks, their air,  

And pretty forms, a doubtful sex declare;  

Nor men, nor women, yet so mix'd together,  

substance and shadow, they are both, yet neither.  

say, thoughtless woman, can such triflers please,  

Can they thy boundless rage of lust appease?  

Or in thy heart extinguish mad desire?  

(That heart which burns "with more than Aetna's fire.")  

In vain gay W M riots in thy love,  

In vain thy thirsty pass'ons D —T prove.  

Young P H came, his talents try'd,  

No sooner offend, than his efforts dy'd ;  

Thy vast abyss o'erwhelm'd the tender boy,  

No fire was left on F  

Y to employ;  
With thee engaging, his weak flame expir'd,  
And once o'ercome, he ne'er again desir'd  

No further off' rings to thy shrine conyey'd,  

No further weakness by attempts betray'd. 1  
Had  

Had G—— M's first to W M's force been joiu'd,  

Thou might} have yielded to their pow'r combin'd;  
Their pointed efforts might have cool'd thy flame,  
And W——y still enjoy'd a spotless name;  

Oh! had I brought these jointly to my aid,  

To B T never, never hadst thou stray'd  
W * and Co. had then thy joys partook,  
W and Co, had never been forsook.  

But now, what powers can thy keen lust destroy,  
Calm thy mad wishes, or thy passions cloy?  
Witness this truth, ye too victor'ous band  

Whom am'rous joys and wanton loves command;  

Who fondly flutter round the yielding fair,  
And wives protect with more than husband's care.  
But chiefly ye, who on record betray'd,  

How oft' in am'rous dalliance ye laid,  

In W- Y's arms, o'erwhelm'd with magic love,  

(Love, which your efforts never could remove)  
This truth attest, that with enjoyment fir'd,  

New joys she sought, new pleasures still deũr d.  
No more th' illustrious youths, who covet fame,  
And claim by noble deeds a deathles das;  
shall, like Connwallis, ev'ry danger scorn,  

And with victorious wreaths their broyws adorn;  

No more, like Ropxey, peerless honors gain,  
And ride triumphant o'er the subject main  
No more, like Fox, with patriot zeal elate,  
Make senates wise, and fave a sinking state ;  
Each ardent youth by my example led,  

Is anxious now an ENGLIsH dame to wed;  
More splendid honors deck my greater name,  
And point to all an easier path to fame.  

He, who of old with love of fame inspir'd,  
The b i of Diaxa fir'd,  

Had he now liv'd, would court an Engslish dame,  

And by his wife immortalize his name.  

Let Pon rIA proofs of constancy supply,  
Let AnxRIA teach a husband how to die;  

Our wives, more wise, to all their favors give,  

And teach their modern lovers how to live.  
Could ridicule, O Wi, touch thy heart,  

Would I could find the vulnerable part!  

But fruitless is my aim} and vain the toil,  

Back on myself the blunted darts recoil;  

Then far asunder as the poles we part,  

hate thy person, as I dread thy heart;  

Insatiate wife (accursed be that name)  

Absorb'd in lust, in infamy, and shame;
