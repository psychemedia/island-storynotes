## Judas Trees

ROOKLEY. THE JUDAS TREE. —The M44;00 WO/id of June 4th says; " Specimen of the Judas tree is said to be in bloom at Dulwich —one of the only two trees of the kind in England. The name of the tree, we are told, is derived from the legend that Judas Iscariot hanged himself on a tree of this sort. [The Judas tree —cerri. rosemni —is not so uncommon as our contemporary has been led to believe. Specimens of it may be seen in the Isle of Wight. This tree is common on the shores of Asia Minor, and in all the East, and abounds on the Bosphorus. It is very beautiful in all its stages. Very early in Spring dowers of a bright pale red burnt out before any leaf appears, not only from every part of the branches, but from the trunk, piercing the thick, strong bark down to the root in a very remarkable manner. For this reason it is celled red bud. These buds are gathered and used with other raw vegetables by the Greeks and Turks in salads, to which they add an agreeable colour and taste. One of these trees is now in full bloom at ltookley Cottage. —Ed. 1. W. C. P.] TOTLAND BAY.

BROOKE. The JUDAS TREE—Mr. Robert Laing, gardener to Charles Seely, Esq., M.P., at the hon. gentleman's seat, Furzedown Park, Tooting Common, Surrey, writes, bearing out our remark in a late issue that the Judas Tree (rirri., xilignitAlreena) is not so uncommon in this country as a contemporary from whom we then quoted had been led to believe. Our contemporary stated at Dulwich was one of the only two Judas trees in England. Last week a correspondent wrote us that there is a tree of this kind in bloom at Rookley, and Mr. Laing now informs us that at Mr. Seely's Surrey seat there are four fine Judas trees, while Mr. Rogers, the Freshwater naturalist, states that in Farringford Park is to be mem one of the moot magnificent trees of the kind in England. This Ls noticed under our Freshwater heading

FRESHWATER

A MAGNIFICENT JUDAS TREE IN FARRINGFORD PARK. ln reference to a quotation from the Christian World, relating to the Judas tree, in our last issue, Mr. J. H. T. Rogers, naturalist, of Roseberry House, Freshwater, writes us under date June 17th: The writer to the Christian World makes a great mistake in stating that there are only two Judas trees in England. There are two growing in Farringford Park, the seat of Lord Tennyson. One of them a flower and a leaf of which I enclose is perhaps the finest in England. It is over 40 feet in height, and I have watched the growth of this magnificent tree for more than 40 years. It is a beautiful sight when in full bloom, viz., from the end of May and June. The flowers are just now beginning to fall."

"JUDAS TREE..." To the Editor of Ike Ide of Wight County P r e .s. Sir,—lt may not be uninteresting to your readers whow, have taken note of the remarks in your columns as to the existence of so-calked Judas Trees in the Island, to be reminded that there is another tradition to the effect that the traitor apostle hung himself upon an elder tree. Indeed there is a passage in Sir John Niaundeville which says that the very elder•tree wax still in existence when he visited Jerusalem. This idea is referred to by Shakespeare in " Love's Labour Lost," and in BenJons. in. "He shall be y. iur Judas,and you shall be his elder•tree to hang on ; ' and in Piers Plowman it is said that the Father of Falsehood deceived Judas and then afterwards hung him on an elder.—Yours, &c., E. J. L. Newchurch, July 6th, 1885.

RANDOM JOTTINGS

...

A correspondent informs me that at the annual vestry meeting at Shalfleet it was reported that the Church steeple was in a somewhat dilapidated and dangerous condition, and that a committee was formed to obtain advice as to whether it was not advisable, for the public safety, to pull the steeple down. My correspondent proceeds:"No doubt many of your readers are aware that the steeple was built on the fine old Norman tower about century ago, and local tradition has it that the good people of Shalfleet of that day, imbued with the idea of making tbeir church more modern and up-to-data, actually sold the fine peal of bells which hung in the tower to raise the money for building the steeple. The bells, it was stated, were taken to France. It was this transaction which prompted the well-known couplet:

The Shalfleet poor and silly people  
Sold their bells to buy a steeple.

—My good friend the Vicar of Shalfleet is now badly in need of funds to purchase a new organ, and knowing that the parishioners of that ancient village, if as 'poor,' are not as 'silly,' as their ancestors, might I, in a rude emulation of the lines of a former scribe, suggest—

That tbe Shalfleet peepto, quick to bargain,  
Should sell their steeple and buy an organ."

—I think the suggestion made by my correspondent is deserving of consideration. The couplet, by the way, is a little bit shaky as to "rhyme," but there's "reason" in it, ead with regard to the rhyme, I've seen worse in Shakespeare! In Murray’s Isle of Wight Handbook, edited by the Rev. G. E. Jeans, M.A., F.S.A., vicar of Shorwell and rector of Mottiston, I find the following reference to Shalfleet Church: “ Shalfleet Church is, architecturally, the most intereesting in the Island. Its dedication, strangely, is unknown, though the church was built before Domesday Book. The huge, square Norman tower, with walls 5 feet thick, forms a most striking object from every point of view, and is unique as a combination of castle and church, but is somewhat injured by tbe 18th century low spire." I don't wish to speak ill of the dead, but it seems difficult to find any excuse for that bygone generation of Shalfleet people who sold tbeir church bells for purposs of sticking that extinguisher-like arrangement on top of the grand tower, and if I were a member of the vestry I should hold up both hands for ramoviag the incongruous feature, which has neither beauty nor antiquity to recommend it, making it pay for the next best thing to bells in the way of church music — an organ worthy of the venerable edifice and of the ancient parish.

Welsh Gypsy Folk Tales

*I'm a bit wary pulling this collection together, even though it would make for an excellent set of story notes, in part because of the "prior claim" that Daniel Morden could argue to have over it. For example, his book "Dark Tales from the Woods" retells several of these stories, and at least one of his workshops (on story structure, a workshop I have attended) critiques how his version of one of the tales was transformed from the original. That said, my better half has a family line descended from two Welsh gipsy families, the Woods and the Prices...*
