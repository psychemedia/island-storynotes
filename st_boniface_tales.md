"THE BISHOP'S ACRE"
around which such a halo of mystery has grown, must now be considered. This plot of ground at the foot of the Down stands on the north side of St. Boniface Road, just outside the parish boundaries, and before Ventnor, in 1867, was constituted a separate Urban Authority, formed a part of the Newchurch parish.

Several interesting stories have arisen in connection with it. The earliest I can find is the following:

"There are few places of antiquity but what have some extraordinary stories told of them. Among those circulate in this neighbourhood is the following. A gentleman mistaking his road during a heavy snow, and descending, in consequence of it, the steep down of St. Boniface, on horseback, he was so affected by the danger he was in, that he vowed if ever he reached the bottom of the hill in safety, he would, as a memento of the kindness of Providence, purchase the land, and present it to the church of Shanklin." `[Hassell, Tour to IW, vol. ii, pp. 1-2.]`

Albin, five years later, repeats this version, and further says that:

"It needs only to be added that a small parcel of land, containing about an acre, was given to the living in this situation, and, as supposed, in consequence of that vow." `[Albin, Hist. of IW, p. 494]`

The story, as related by Adams, varies the particulars:

"Good St. Boniface, during a very stormy night, having missed his path, found himself descending this steep,—not a very pleasant expedition on horse-back,—and thereupon vowed that if he reached the bottom in safety, he would purchase the land where he alighted, and endow with it the Church of Shanklin. He did descend in safety, and he piously kept his vow; —the land is known in remembrance thereof as the "Bishop's Acre." `[Adams, IW., p. 199.]`

The tradition, as related by Canon Venables is:

"That a certain bishop who, riding over the Downs, lost his way in a thick mist, and to his horror found himself on the brink of the precipitous face of the hill; not knowing what to do, he threw the reins on his horse's neck, who at once beginning to descend the steep slope, his rider gave himself up for lost, and invoking the aid of St. Boniface, vowed that if he reached the bottom in safety he would give an acre of ground to the church which bore his name. Either through the aid of the saint, or the sure-footedness of his steed, the bishop did reach the bottom of the hill with neck and limbs unbroken, and the Bishop's Acre is a lasting memorial of the perilous descent." `[Venables, G. to I.W., p. 218.]`

Canon Venables says, in alluding to the legend, "that the story does account, in a manner not altogether incredible, for the singular fact that this little rectangular plot lying by itself in the midst of other property, and not even in the parish of Bonchurch, has belonged to the Rector from time immemorial." As the "old sea captain" says in his *Wanderings in the Isle of Wight*, "it is a curious tale, but as to the truth of it—that is quite another story."

In the Appendix to Worsley's History a charter of Walter de Insula is given, granting land on the side of St. Boniface, next to Luccombe, to the monks of Quarr Abbey. The charter is couched in the following terms:—

"Sciant praesentes et futuri quod ego Walterus de Insula, assensu et voluntate Galfridi filii et haeredis mei, dedi et concessi Deo et beatae Marie de Quarraria et monachis ibidem Deo servientibus terram cultibilem lateris mentis sancti Bonifacii qui est versus Luvecumbam," etc. `[W., App., No. 64.]`

Mr. Percy Stone gives the purport of the charter clearly:— "A feoffment in fee of Land made to the monks of Quarrer according to boundaries set by common assent of the Parties. Gift by Walter de Insula, with the consent of his son Geoffery, of the side of St. Boniface down next Luccombe: testibus Will. filio Stur, Will Avenel. Seal, a knight riding at speed in his right hand the bridle, in his left extended a hawk. `[Archit. Antiqt., vol. i, p. 110.]` The date of the charter is not given, and though assigned to the time of Henry III, is probably of an earlier date, towards the close of King John's reign. Walter de Insula died in 1221; the son, Geoffrey, was probably of full age when he assented to the grant, and therefore born by or before 1201.

The gift could not have been to the church of Shanklin, since that church was not founded till a later period—after 1305 and before 1333. The edifice is not mentioned in the Dean's return of the Island churches, but is referred to in Bishop Stratford's register, 1323-33, and is then in the presentation of John de Insula, the probable founder of the church and the patron of the Bonchurch living. Shanklin was a chapel—not having the right of burial or of administering the sacraments, and the residents had to resort to Brading in order to bury their dead. The Bishop could not have been St. Boniface, who lived several centuries earlier. When the temporalities belonging to Quarr Abbey were dispersed, there is no deed to show how this parcel of land became attached to the Bonchurch living. It was not unusual however, where monasteries had been previously established, to transfer the tithes, glebe, etc., to a church of later foundation in the locality from whence the offerings were derived, the consent of the Bishop having first been obtained.

Mr. F. J. Hughes, the present owner of 5, 6. 7, and 8, St. Boniface Terrace, rents part of the glebe land known as "Bishop's Acre" on lease, renewable every twenty-one years, from the Ecclesiastical Commissioners and the Rector of Bonchurch, at an annual rental of £12, The land thus leased is included in and forms part of the garden ground attached to the houses.

"ST. BONIFACE WISHING WELL."

There is another feature connected with the early history of Ventnor which ought to be noticed. The "Wishing Well," or "Holywell Spring," as it is called by Worsley, is situated on the steep face of the down, not far from its summit, and although, in these later days, it has fallen from its high estate, and its claims are barely recognised, has still several interesting points connected with it which call for notice. Its antiquity is undoubted, and if the past history could be traced we should have to go back many centuries to a period when well-worship was in vogue. This of itself should excite the interest and enlist the sympathies of all who visit the spot. Reverence, or in other words, well-worship, can be traced from the most remote antiquity all the world over. It appears to have been common alike to the Pagan Celts and to the Saxon Christians. It was found difficult to put down this worship, and many edicts of the Church were directed against it, from the 5th to the 11th centuries. What could not be suppressed would appear to have been at last sanctioned under the patronage of the Saints; hence we have St. Boniface Well, St. Lawrence Well and Holiwell, Niton, in the neighbourhood, as examples of such holy wells.

"I think there can be little doubt," writes Mr. T. W. Shore, "that the 'Wishing Wells' are survivals of the medieval holy wells. In Hampshire and the Isle of Wight we have a considerable number of wells and springs which had a sanctity in previous centuries, and which have, or had, a 'Folk Lore' of their own down to the last century. First, in point of interest, among these is St. Boniface Well, at Bonchurch." `[Shore, Memorial Vol., p. 99 (H. F. C).]`

The earliest reference to the Well is found in the pages of Tomkins' *Tour to the Island*, showing that the sanctity of the well and its claims were duly recognised—"Just above the house (St. Boniface House) is a spring, which was formerly held in high veneration by the seamen. It was their custom, in passing this place, to lower the fore-topmast in reverence to St. Boniface." `[Tomkins, Tour to I. W., vol. ii, p. 121.]` A further notice occurs in the pages of Englefield:—"Near to the top of the slope, and in the steepest part of it, is a small spring, famous by the name of St. Boniface's Well, and regarded by the people with a sort of religious veneration," adding later:—"I climbed up the steep side, by the path which leads to the celebrated Well of St. Boniface, which, however, was at that time a very inconsiderable spring. A spring at this height is a most remarkable circumstance, and the only instance of the kind in the whole range of chalk downs. It indicates some stratum within the hill differing from the chalk, which would certainly let the rain water sink through its substance here, as it does everywhere else." `[Guide to the I of W., p. 219.]` The late Canon Venables says— "The remarkable fact of a spring bursting forth at so great an elevation is alike interesting to the geologist and to the lover of old superstitions, from the reverence which it is said, was formerly shown to it. The popular belief was, that if the well were reached without once looking back, any wish formed while drinking the water would certainly be granted, and the story goes that the lads and lasses of the neighbourhood used to resort to the well on St. Boniface Day to deck it with garlands of flowers." `[Picturesque Beauties &c. of I. W., pp. 37 and 130.]` This custom, I need hardly say, no longer exists among the merrymakings of the district, but is buried in oblivion, with many other partially religious observances of the olden times in "Merrie England."

p189-90 Boniface Wishing Well

It is difficult, in our narrow limits, to note down all that the tourist ought to see in this agreeable neighbourhood `[Bonchurch]`. But he will ascend, of course, the steep sides of St. Boniface Down, to enjoy the surpassingly beautiful panorama which spreads beneath and around it. He will visit the Well — *St. Bonny's* or *The Wishing Well* — which once bubbled brightly out of the chalky bosom of the hill, but is now reduced to a sandy pool. It was first discovered, says the legend, by a certain bishop, who, riding across the hill on a misty night, lost his way, and found his steed, to his horror, slowly sliding down the precipitous side, until at length he suddenly drew up with his hoofs fixed in the hollow of this well. The bishop thereupon vowed to St. Boniface that if he reached the bottom securely he would dedicate to his honour an acre of land. The saint closed with the bargain; the bishop reached home without further let or mishap; and the land, known as The Bishop's Acre, still belongs to the glebe of Bonchurch. It lies at the foot of the hill, and is marked out by a ridge of turf.

In the old times, on the feast-day of St. Boniface, the village maidens were wont to ascend the down and place garlands of flowers about the well, in honour of the patron saint. A superstition attached to it, that a wish breathed inwardly by the stranger who for the first time drank of its water, would assuredly be fulfilled,- a pleasant enough fancy, which the lads and lasses of Bonchurch doubtlessly, in their love-making days, turned to good account.

p30
The "Wishing Well," situated some short distance from its summit, is a curious instance of a spring appearing at so great a height, when unsurrounded by more elevated ground; whence it derives its supply can only be matter of curious conjecture.

This spot, so long celebrated in the village annals, was a veiy few years ago nearly deprived of its celebrity. An old pensioner, who either rented the ground or was employed by other persons, in the hope of turning the spring to greater and more advantageous account, commenced deepening the "Well." A few strokes of his pickaxe, however, dissipated the illusion. The patron saint, or perchance the presiding naiad, offended at the sacrilegious intrusion, denied a further supply; and the water at once disappeared, and quickly percolated through the chalky marl, which had been disturbed around its sacred precincts. Whether the reprobate character of its invader frightened the spring from its propriety, cannot be told; but it is certain that, subsequently to his death and reformation, a few years after, the water again returned, and still affords a watering-place for the browsing sheep, and opportunity for the curious to sip at its hallowed fountain. The situation of the "Well" is readily seen from the road, by the bright green verdure of its sedgy precincts.

A story is extant, that vessels passing this spring used, in former days, to lower their topmasts in honour


of the saint. It is almost a pity to throw a doubt upon this saintly custom; but it appears far more probable that the "ancient mariner," fearing the fierce gusts of wind which blow with sudden violence from the high land about the promontory of Dunnose, usually took the precaution of lowering the top or upper sails, to prevent mischief happening from these sudden squalls.

...

The custom, also, of resorting to the "Wishing Well" (crowned with chaplets of flowers on St. Boniface Day) no longer exists among the merrymakings of the native Damons and Phillises, but is buried in oblivion, in common with many other partially religious observances of the olden time in merrie England."

p44 Quarr abbey - The following legend may not prove uninteresting to the readers:-"At a short distance south of the ruins of the Abbey, is a wood, formerly thickly timbered, but now only consisting of a few decayed oaks and brushwood; it is called Eleanor's Grove, from a tradition that Eleanor of Guienne, Queen of Henry I., was imprisoned at Quarr, and frequented this secluded spot; where, after death, it is related, she was interred in a golden coffin, which is supposed still to be protected from sacrilegious cupidity, by magical spells.

p 76 "The Wishing Well on St. Boniface Down was once a limpid fountain, consecrated by a fantastic legend. Favoured with the benison of a Saint, it possessed a remarkable and highly useful property. Whatsoever might be the wish you breathed to your own heart, before you first tasted the crystal stream, it would infallibly receive a speedy fulfilment. So, Louisa of the dark deep eyes, and Caroline of the raven locks, and Kate of the fair broad brow, oft-speeded —in all simplicity and with due faith — for of what use is a legend without ye have faith in it? — speeded to the well of St.Boniface, and ere they drank of its lucent waters silently formed the wishes on whose fulfilment their souls were most intent."—*Adam's Garden Isle.*

Several stone coffins have, at different times, been excavated at Quarr; a few coins and some other relics have also been discovered, but not of a nature or in such abundance as to satisfy the antiquary, or throw any vivid light upon the history of the abbey. In 1857 a curious discovery was made by some labourers engaged in the construction of a new road through the old abbey grounds, of "three small stone boxes or chests, each chest being about two feet in length and one foot wide. They were placed side by side,—two of them nearly close together, and the third a foot or two to the south. Upon removing the heavy stones of which the lids were composed, three human skeletons in a good state of preservation were found.

ENVIRONS OF RYDE. 163

The leg and arm bones were on either side, the ribs and small bones in the centre, and the skulls at the western end, the latter being in all three cases turned upside down. It was evident that these remains had been removed at some time or other from the place of their original burial; and that they were of persons of distinction was beyond doubt, or such care would not have been bestowed upon them" (Isle of Wight Observer). One of the skeletons was pronounced to be that of an aged man, another that of an aged female, and the third that of "a tall fine man about forty years of age." It has been suggested, and there is an air of probability about the suggestion, that they were the remains of Count Baldwin, his wife, and his son Henry. They are now in the Museum at Ryde.

This is just the spot where "the violet of a legend" might be expected to blossom; and the traditions connected with the abbey are of a fantastic character. One tells of a deep subterraneous passage, closed by a golden gate, and is evidently the offspring of the awe and wonder created in the minds of the vulgar by monastic wealth and power. Another is not less wildly fabulous:—"At a short distance south of the ruins of the abbey is a wood, formerly thickly timbered, but now only consisting of a few decayed oaks and brushwood; it is called Eleanor's Grove, from a tradition that Eleanor of Guienne, queen of Henry II., was imprisoned at Quarr, and frequented this secluded spot, where, after death, it is related, she was interred in a golden coffin, which is supposed still to be protected from sacrilegious cupidity by magical spells." About half a century ago a search was made for this golden coffin, with the result of discovering one of common character, containing a female skeleton .

Chapter IV

"Let me now tell you," said Owen Gladden, "of a ramble I took to the "wishing-well" on the side of St. Boniface High Down."

"Yes, do tell us, uncle! How high is St. Boniface Down?"

"What do you mean by the wishing-well, uncle?"

"One question at a time. Boniface Down is, perhaps, six or seven hundred feet high; but what the meaning of the wishing-well is, and how it came to be called by that name, I cannot tell. As the tale goes, whatever a person who has reached the spot without once looking back, wishes for, while drinking the water of the well, he is sure to have. My pleasant landlady told me that, when she visited the place, so frightened was she at being up so dangerous a height, her first wish was that she might be able to get safe down again."

"Very good, indeed! She could not well have had a better wish. Did you say that the wishing well was at Ventnor?"

"Yes. ..."

...

"I entertained my landlord with an account of a desperate adventure in which I once engaged at night, to take into custody a party of gipsy robbers, so that we passed the time very pleasantly till we came to St. Boniface Down."

"Will you tell us of that adventure of die gipsy robbers, uncle?"

"Not now, not now! let me go on with my story. We went down the side of St. Boniface Down very cautiously, for the place is fearfully steep, and one false step might have precipitated us five or six hundred feet headlong. At last, after descending about a third part of the precipitous high down, we came to the spot; but a fall of loose chalk had completely filled up the weU, so that had it not been for the rushes which grew there, no one would have suspected that water had ever issued from the place."

"Then it was of no use your wishing anything, uncle."

"None at all, none at all; and if there had been water there, it would have made no difference on that head; but I thought of what my landlady had told me about wishing herself safe down again, and it appeared to me to be a very natural wish."

"Was it so very dangerous?"

"Dangerous! I did my best to look calm and collected; but I found it very necessary to steady myself with my stick, and to use all my caution, while my landlord related to me some of the popular tales about the high downs and cliffs."

"Did he tell you those tales while you were standing in that dangerous spot?"

"He did. He said there was a strip of land at the bottom of the high down that no one could ever build upon; and the tale commonly told about it was this: —-Once upon a time a certain bishop, on horseback, whether it was bishop Boniface or not, he did not say, was benighted on the high down. Not knowing what to do, he threw the reins on the neck of his horse, that he might take his own course. The horse directly began to descend the precipitous steep."

"What! down the steep side of St. Boniface?"

"Yes; the poor animal picked his way, as well as he could, while the bishop kept praying all the way, as he had good reason to do, that his life might be preserved. In his jeopardy he made a vow, that if ever he again set foot on level ground he would buy the place that he first trod on, for pious purposes. The horse carried his master safely down the hill, the bishop kept his vow in purchasing the land, and it goes by the name of Bishop's Acre to this day."

"Well, that is a curious tale! Do you think it is true?"

"I hardly know what to say about it; there is some truth in most of the wildest stories which are told about particular spots and places, though they are often much exaggerated. It is very possible that a bishop's horse might have safely carried his master from the high down to the level ground below; but if he did do so, all that I can say is, it is not very probable that he went down the steep part by the wishing-well."

"What tales were told you about the high cliffs, uncle?"

"Several, that I have reason to believe were true. My landlord said that, some years ago, two soldiers who were intoxicated, lost their way by night and became confused. They approached the perpendicular cliffs that are seen as you pass between the St. Lawrence and Niton, and over they they went. I dare say the cliffs are more than five hundred feet high; it was a terrible fall, and both of them were killed. There are accidents enough in the world without intemperance adding to their number."

"There is a conically formed rock near the shore, called the 'deer-bound rock,' and I will tell you why. A deer that was hard-pressed by the hounds, took a flying leap from the cliffs to the rock, and ever since then it has borne the name of the deer-bound rock."

"Was the deer saved, or did the dogs follow him?"
