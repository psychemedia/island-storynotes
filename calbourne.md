PARKHURST REFORMATORY.—SIX convicts of this establishment escaped from confinement on Saturday week, and on Thursday following four others. Some of the inhabitants of the island went out in search of them, and, with the aid of the police, succeeded in capturing the whole of the party which first escaped, but not before they had committed several depredations. They broke into Arctic Cottage, near Cowes, and stole several joints of meat, bread, butter, &c. They then proceeded to Mr. Bannister's rope manufactory, which they broke into, when they regaled themselves with their good fare, and disguised themselves in the workmen's clothes which were left on the premises. At Calbourne, they broke into the house of Mr. C. Westmore, and stole some wearing apparel and food; also the house of Mr. Gradage, and the house of Mr. Way, of Calbourne Mill, where they emptied a decanter of wine, &c. The first party, six in number, were all committed for trial to the Winchester assizes on Monday by the county magistrates.

CHILD DROWNED IN A MILL STREAM.—An Inquest was held at Calbourne Mill, on Monday, before Frederick Blake, Esq.. Coroner for the Isle of Wight, on the body of David Way. aged 2 years and 6 months.—Phebe Warder said: I am 12 years old. I live at Yarmouth, but have been staying at Calbourne Mill nearly a week. Yesterday morning, during divine service, I saw the deceased close to the back stream belonging to Calbourne Mill, where his grandfather lives. He was throwing stones into the water. Within ten minutes afterwards I heard a noise in the water farther down the stream. I looked and saw deceased in the water, which was flowing very fast, and carrying him down the stream. I went into the water with a young child in my arms, but the water carried deceased away too fast, and I could not get him out. I told his mother of it. I was wet above my knees when I went into the water.—John James, who was shortly afterwards passing, said that, in consequence of information he received, he searched for the deceased, and found him in the stream hung up in the bushes, about 300 yards from the place where the last witness saw him playing. Deceased was under the water, which was about three feet deep. He took him out, and found him quite dead.—The Coroner having summed up, the Jury returned their verdict —" Accidentally Drowned.

ISLE OF WIGHT PETTY SESSIONS COUNTY BENCH. The magistrates present on Saturday were Sir Henry P. Gordon, Bart, (chairman), Admiral Crozier, Captain Hamond, Captain Kerr, and Mr. James Coape.

Obtaing Goods Under False Pretences.— Ann Scovell, a single woman, aged 33, was charged with obtaining groceries under false pretences from the shop of Mr. Dalzell of Carisbrooke. The prisoner lived at Newbridge with her father, a labourer, who had recently been in very embarrassed circumstances. The prosecutor said,— I know the prisoner from her coming to my shop. On the 21st of November she came and asked me to trust her husband with goods from one fortnight to the other. She said her husband, whose name was William was in constant work for Mr. Westmore, of Calbourne Mill and they had two or three young men lodgers boarding with them. On the strength of these representations, I let her have goods to the amount of 15s 1 1/2d. They consisted of tea, sugar, butter, cheese, &c. The tea and sugar came to 1s 9d, but I do not recollect the other particulars. Part of the goods she took away, and directed the remainder to be forwarded on by Conway, the carrier, to be left, at Sweetbridge, on the road to Newbridge, and I forwarded them accordingly. The prisoner promised to call and pay for them at the end of a fortnight. She came again on the 27th of November, and said she wanted some more goods on trust till the fortnight had expired. I served her with four gallons of bread, 1/2lb. of tea, and other articles, amounting in all to 17s 3 1/2d. It was on the strength of the former representation that I let her have these goods. She came again on the following Wednesday, the day before the expiration of the fortnight, and asked for more goods, saying her husband would call next day and settle with me for all. I said I was doubtful about it, and thought she said I need not fear it would be all right. I refused to let her have any more. She went away and I have not seen her since till she was in custody. I am sure she said her husband, William, and not her father. A Mrs. Downer, who is not present, was in the shop and heard her mention about her husband. Thomas Lawer, a policeman, stationed at Carisbrooke, said,— On the previous Monday, about 2 o'clock in the afternoon, I went to the cottage occupied by the prisoner's father, and saw the prisoner, who in reply to my questions said, it was not her own house, she was unmarried, and had lived with her father all her life; she occupied one room there and never had any young men lodgers. She said she was ill and under medical treatment, and I did not then take her into custody. William Scovell, aged 61, father of the prisoner, said he was in work for Mr. Westmore, at Calbourne Mill, for a short time, and thought it would be constant. They were in difficulties through his being some time out of employment, and he told his daughter, the prisoner, to go to the prosecutor's shop and get some goods on credit. The prisoner had been there occasionally before for articles, and he thought it was a very nice shop to deal at. The truth was he had to pay some money and was "blocked up," and had to get credit. He had two boys boarding at home, one 18 and the other 16 years old. The prisoner in defence said she asked for credit for her father, and did not say a word about a husband neither did she say anything about young men lodgers, but said her two brothers boarded and lodged with her father She could not do such a thing as tell a lie about it. The Chairman said that the bench must commit her, as the prosecutor had sworn positively she said the articles were for her husband and not her father. He was glad that a jury, and not the bench, would have to decide the point. Her father's bail for her appearance was accepted.

BRIDGE AT NEWBRIDGE. The Roads Committee (chairman, Mr. A. J Matthews) reported that the county surveyor had notified that the work of widening the bridge at Newbridge and the stream flowing through it had been completed a cost of £B5 5s. 6d.

NOT LIABLE. The same committee reported that Mr. Whillier, the tenant of Calbourne Mill, had informed the county surveyor that owing to the deepening and widening of the stream his hatchway was not of sufficient width to let off the water and storm floods, and in consequence his mill had been flooded, and had requested that the hatchway might be widened the expense of the county, but the committee were advised that the County Council was not liable to remedy the flooding.
