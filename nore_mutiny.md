PORTSMOUTH.

The mutiny among the seamen at Sheerness and the Nore has got to such a height as demands more vigorous measures than have yet been used. There has been enough of concession, and the refractory seamen must be brought back to their duty by other than lenient and palliative measures. The men on board the Inflexible, of 64 guns, lyinging in Sheerness harbour determined to carry the ship to the Nore. The captain of the forecastle took the command, and they carried the ship out. In passing the St. Fiorenzo, commanded by Sir H. B. Neale, they fired a shot into her, because her men did not cheer them as they passed. Sir H. B. Neale, to prevent more disagreeable and fatal consequences, desired his men to get upon the Shrouds and cheer. They did so in obedience to their captain, and perhaps some bloodshed was spared in consequence of the judicious conduct of this excellent officer. The seamen at the Nore and in the Downs have proceeded to acts of mutiny and violence which were not thought of in Lord Bridport's fleet.

Almost all the officers of the Stag frigate, are turned a Shore by the crew. They requested Capt Yorke to remain on board, but he thought proper to share the fate of his officers. Several other ships continue unsatisfied, principally with different officers; and several have been sent on shore by the seamen, and not permitted to return to their ships. The seamen have not been guilty any personal disrespect to their officers on board; they regularly perform the duties of the ship; but it is greatly to be lamented that even in indifferent matters they do not shew that obedience which they formerly used to do.

One Heather, of the Mars, who had assumed the title of Judge Advocate of the Fleet, has been tried for conspiracy, and correspondence with persons Portsmouth. It having been discovered by the fleet that an improper correspondence had been carried on, the boats of the Royal George and Queen Charlotte were appointed to keep a look-out on nights, if possible, to prevent it, and detect the author or authors; on the second night's watch, about twelve o'clock, they boarded a boat rowing from the Mars to the Duke, in which they discovered papers that were produced as evidence, and proved the means of convicting Heather, who was, in consequence, sentenced to hanged.—He was afterwards at the request of his own Ship's company, reprieved; but ordered to receive two dozen lashes, which were inflicted.

The following officers, we understand, have resigned their commands in the Channel fleet: Captain Holloway, of the Duke; Captain Griffiths, of the London; Captain Nichols, of the Marlborough; Captain Eaton, of the Medusa; Captain Cook, of La Nymphe; Captain Miller, of Megaera; Captain Barker, of the Incendiary; and Captain Mowbray, of the Fly. The principle upon which they have sent in their resignation is, that they are unwilling to run the risk of experiencing a repetition of the insults lately offered to them.

One of the lieutenants of the Repulse man of war has been promoted, at the recommendation of Admiral Duncan, for his spirited behaviour in resisting, with success, the late mutinous conduct of the crew of that ship at Yarmouth.

...

Plymouth, May 23.

Notwithstanding that this is the third day that the Channel fleet has been off this port, endeavouring get down Channel, which circumstance alone, to every rational mind, is the surest indication of the crews of those ships being satisfied with the manner in which government have complied with their demands, yet the sailors at this port continu in the same mutinous state, cheering in the morning and evening, and keeping the command of the ships. What will satisfy them, or when the business is to end, God only knows. A number of sailors were ducked yesterday, for disobedience of orders.

Five o'clock, P. M. are happy to say, that this moment Sir J. B. Warren has again resumed the command of his ship in Cawsand Bay: as soon as he came alongside, the sailors manned the shrouds, and gave him three cheers, and on his getting on board, his broad pendant was hoisted at the main top-gallant-mast head, and the Pomone's colours shifted from blue to red; the Artois, Galatea, and Sylph, instantly shifted colours, and at the same time gave three cheers, so that we have reason to hope that perfect order is once more restored on board this squadron. That the same may be adopted by every ship in this harbour, is the earnest wish of every one who has the safety the country at heart.

Sheerness, May 23. The mutiny, which has long prevailed at this port, has not yet subsided. The sailors are determined not to return to their duty until the arrival of the Lords of the Admiralty. A large bunch of blue and pink ribbands is universally worn by them: their motto is, "Succcss to the Delegates of the Fleet." Two regiments of militia arrived here last night, which enraged the sailors to such degree, that they instantly seized upon the whole of the gun-boats, and showed every disposition to proceed to the most violent extremities.— They afterwards took them from the harbour to the Nore; and this morning they struck the flag of Adm. Buckner, on board the Sandwich, and hoisted a red one in its stead, which was immediately answered by all ships at the Nore and in the harbour, except the Mary yacht. The Delegates informed the crew of this vessel that they did not wish them to join in their combination, but insisted on their giving them three cheers whenever they should pass one another.

As there has appeared in our last an account of the death of Mr. Saffery, surgeon and agent for the sick and hurt seamen at this place, in which it was erroneously stated that the seamen went to his house for the purpose of hanging him, and that in a fit of despair he cut his throat: in justice to the seamen, we now state, that they never went to his house, which is in the garrison, for any purpose whatever; and that on their hearing of his having cut his throat, they expressed great sorrow, declaring, that if they disapproved of any thing in the business of the sick quarters, they intended him no harm.

Kentish Gazette - Tuesday 06 June 1797

*Answer from the Lords of the Admiralty to the Sailors at the Nore. (See a statement of their demands in our FRIDAY's paper.)*

To these demands, on the 22d of May, the Commissioners of the Admiralty replied:— That after the very liberal attention of his Majesty, in increasing the wages and provisions of the seamen and marines in his Majesty's service, their Lordships are extremely surprised to find the seamen and marines of his Majesty's ships at the Nore and Sheerness should be still in a state of disobedience, and bringing forward further requests; their Lordships therefore cannot accede to any such requests.

With respect to the first Article, their Lordships declare, that all additional allowances of wages and provisions, and every other regulation announced at Portsmouth, have been estimated by his Majesty's Order in Council, and by Act of Parliament, and extended to all seamen and marines in his Majesty's service. That with respect to the second article, the nature of the service in time of war does not admit of the men having leave to go to their families, except under very particular circumstances, of which the Captains or other superior officers alone can judge. That with respect to the third and fifth Articles, the ships company shall be paid in the manner poinhd out by the several Acts of Parliament at present in force.

With respect to the fourth Article, all arrangements concerning the officers to be employed in the ships of the squadron, must he settled by the Admiral or Commanding Officer for the time being.

With respect to the sixth Article, if it should be his Majesty's pleasure to pardon all who may have deserted from his service in the Navy, it must be the effect of his Royal Clemency alone, and not of any requisition; that although their Lordships thought proper to go to Portsmouth for the purpose of obtaining more information of the grievances which the seamen and marines in general might have to represent, and of adopting most expeditiously such measures as might be necessary, and granting such further indulgencies as might render their situation more comfortable, and enable them better to provide for the support of their families, no similar reasons exists for their taking such a step on the present occasion. Their Lordships therefore direct, that it is to the officers that ships' companies are to look up, to whom their petitions are always to be presented, and through whom their Lordships determinations are to be expected.

It is their Lordships direction, that, notwithstanding all that has passed before his Majesty's most gracious pardon, and their Lordship's order to all officers, to bury in oblivion all that has passed, are now offered, which should they be refused, you will have to answer for all the melancholy consequences which must attend their persisting in the present state of disobedience and mutiny.

After the Admiral had delivered the foregoing letter to the Delegates of the fleet, they were allowed only ten minutes to consider and return an answer; in place of doing which they took to their boats, went into the harbour, and brought out all the gun boats there to the Great Nore; after they had passed the garrison of Sheerness, the gunboats all fired at the fort, not, as they say, with an intention of doing any damage, but merely to shew they were independent, and not in dread of the fort. The determination of the Delegates, in consequence of the above answer from their Lordships, was, "that nothing could he settled till three of the B. of Admiralty came down to Sheerness."

On the 24th, the seamen received another letter, repeating the offer of pardon, to which the following answer was sent:

To the Lords Commissioners for executing the Office of Lord High Admiral of Great Britain and Ireland, &c.

"I am commanded by the Delegates of the whole fleet assembled in Council, on board his Majesty's ship Sandwich, to inform your Lordships, that they have received your letter from Admiral Buckner, which informs them, that it is not your intention of coming to Sheerness, the same has been communicated to his Majesty's ships and vessels lying here, and the determination of the whole is, that they will not come to any accommodation, until you appear at the Nore, and redress our grievances.  
(Signed) Rich. Parker, President.  
By order of the Committee Delegates of the whole fleet. His Majesty's ship Sandwich. May 25, 1757."

After the above was delivered, the sailors resolved to place the different ships in a posture of defence; and in order prevent any surprize, they, on the 25th inst. unmoored with the whole fleet, and moored again, formed into two lines of battle, with determination of opposing any force that might be sent against them.

All these efforts on the part of the Admiralty to bring the sailors back to their duty having failed of their intended effect, Government, resolved to give them a full opportunity of returning to their duty, granting them one indulgence on which they seemed principally to set their mind—that of having a Board of Admiralty held at Sheerness, to which their Delegates might personally state their grievances.

Accordingly, on Saturday last the Lords of the Admiralty (as we have formerly stated) proceeded to that place; and, that no hindrance might arise to a speedy adjustment, from fears that might be entertained of particular individuals, of being afterwards punished for the share they might have had in the business, their Lordships carried with them a Proclamation, offering his Majesty's free pardon, &c. This, however, failed of effect; since which, another has been issued, both which will appear this paper in the form one general instrument.

BY THE KING.  
A PROCLAMATION.

We think it right to warn all our seamen and marines on board the ships, of the heinous nature of the offences by them committed, and of the dangerous consequences thereof to the spirit and discipline of the British Navy, and the welfare of their country, as well as to their own safety, hereby earnestly require and enjoin all our said seamen and marines immediately, on the notification of this our Royal Declaration, to return to the regular discharge of their duty, as has already been done by the crews of our other squadtons and fleets, stationed at Portsmouth and Plymouth, and elsewhere.

And we hereby declare, that all such feamen and marines, who shall have so returned, or shall so return to their duty, and to whom the said Lord Commissioners of our Admiralty, or any three of them, shall so promise our pardon, shall receive the same accordingly, and shall be discharged and released from all prosecutions, imprisonments, and penalties incurred by reason of any of the acts aforesaid, or by reason of any act of mutiny or disobedience of orders, or any breach or neglect of duty, previously committed by them, or any of them hereby declaring, at the same time, that all such seamen and marines, who shall not take benefit of this our gracious pardon, shall from henceforth, be considered as liable, according to the nature of their offences, to such punishment as the Articles of War and the Law have provided for the same.  
Given at our Court at St. James's, the 27th day of May, 1797, in the 37th Year of our Reign.

Kentish Gazette - Tuesday 06 June 1797

HOUSE OF PEERS — Thursday, June 1.

Naval mutiny.

*Lord Grebvillie* presented a message from the King, relative to this very important subject.

[For which see the proceedings of the House of Commons]

*Lord Grenville* then laid a Copy of the Proclamation referredto on the message, upon the table, and moved, "that his Majesty's most gracious message be taken into consieration tomorrow, and that their Lordships be summoned upon the occasion."--which was summoned accordingly.

...

HOUSE OF COMMONS

...

MESSAGE FROM HIS MAJESTY.

Mr. Pitt brought down the following message from his Majesty :

It is with the deepest concern his Majesty acquaints the House of Commons, that the conduct of the Crews of some of his ships no wat the Nore, in persisting in the most violent and treasonable acts of Mutiny and Disobedience, notwithstanding the full extension to them of all the benefits which had been accepted with gratitude by the rest of his Majesty's fleet, and notwithstanding the repeated offers of his Majesty's most gracious Pardon on their returning to their duty, have compelled his Majesty to call on all his faithful Subjects, to give their utmost assistance in repressing such dangerous and criminal proceedings. His Majesty has directed a copy of the Proclamation, which he has issued for this purpose, to be laid before the House and he cannot doubt that his Parliament will adopt with readiness and decision every measure which can tend, at this important conjuncture, to provide for the Public Security: And His Majesty particularly recommends it to the consideration of Parliament, to make the more effectual provision for the preventing and punishment of all traitorous attempts to excite sedition and mutiny in his Majesty's service, or to withdraw any part of his Majesty's forces, by sea or land, from their duty and allegiance to him, and from that obedience and discipline which are so important to the prosperity and the safety of the British Empire."

The message being read from the chair,

Mr. Pitt moved that his Majesty's be taken into consideration tomorrow.

Mr. Sec. Dundas brought up the Proclamation of his Majesty, which on the motion of Sir John Sinclair, was read. [For which see the second Page.]

Mr. Sheridan next rose, and said that he himself, and he was confident that the House would coincide with him, felt the deepest regret, at the melancholy intelligence just communicated to them in his Majesty's message. The present business was indeed a business of the highest importance, and of extreme delicacy, and, as such he deemed it is duty not now to offer any comments on it.

It was, however, to him, matter additional regret, that the conciliatory proposition which he had been desirous to make, did not meet with the approbation of his Majesty's Ministers: for, he could not help thinking, that, had it been adopted, it would have prevented the unfortunate perseverance of the Seamen in a state of insubordination and discontent. He must now say a word on the other part of his Majesty's Message, which recommended to the House to proceed to the adoption of measures which should tend to give greater vigour to the laws. On this subject he would also abstain from commenting; but, he begged leave to observe, at the same time, that his forbearing at present to offer comments on it, should not be construed into his giving it his assent.

Mr. Pitt mod cordialiy commended the great propriety with which the Hon. Gentleman abstained from making any premature remarks on the melancholy subject of the present communications; nor was he himself by any means tempted to anticipate the observations which he might hereafter be inclined to offer on the more effectual means of preventing the progress of the evil under which we now laboured. He must, however, remind the House, and the Hon. Gentleman (Mr. Sheridan), that the offence stated in the Message was of a nature to call for farther provision to give vigour to the Law. For it was the most malignant, the most criminal, the most odious, and the most dangerous, which the heart of man could conceive, or the corruption and of man could attempt to execute.—The calamitous effects recently experienced from the unfortunate perseverance of the seamen in a state of disorder and discontent—a perseverance that could have no other source but the foul insinuations of treachery, could not be more warmly characterised than they had been by the Hon. Gentleman, when he said, that in comparison of such a crime, the enormity of open treason faded away; and indeed all those who retain any veneration for Law and its salutary effects, must behold the crime in question as paramount in guilt to all other treasons, odious as they are—He therefore trusted the House would proceed in taking due measures to prevent a conduct which in guilt mud excite the utmost indignation; and in importance, called for the utmost precaution which it was possible for the House to apply to it.

...

TO DO

HOUSE OF COMMONS.— Friday, June i. Mr. Secretary Dundas moved for leave to bring bill, empowering his Majesty to raise and embody the Militia that part of Great Britain called Scotland.—Granted. A Message from the Lords informed the House, that their Lordships concurred wirh the House to the means of im proving the promulgation of the laws, and had resolved uptjn Addiefs to his Majesty, in which they desired the concurrence of the House. The Messengers having retired, were afterwards called in and informed, that the House would send an answer to that part of their Lordship's Message which related the Address, by Messengers their own. It was then resolved, on the motion of Mr. Abbot, that the House would take the Message into consideration on Wednesday. His Majesty's Message. The order of the day being moved for taking into consideration his Majesty's Message, The Chancellor of the Exchequer said, that, important a the prdent occasion was, and deep as must be the interest felt in it by the House, he did not think it his duty to trespass much upon their time in recommending the measure which hid to propose. The House learned from the Message, that the instances of his Majesty's beneficence and paternal care, which have been dutifully and affectionately received by the Fleet in general, had produced on the crews of certain ships none of that effect which was reasonably to be expected from them; that although pardon had been repeatedly offered to them, on condition of their returning to their duty, they still remained in state not only of mutiny, but of fuel) open and undisguised hostility, that they had fired other vessels, which were proceeding upon service agreeably to the orders of his Majesty. Much as these circumdances rauft?? be deplored, he had no doubt that the House would unanimously feel the duty of showing, that no difficulties could arife which they would not meet with the firmness and decision due to their own characters, and to the safety of the country, They would have no hesitation in carrying to the foot of the Tluonc the assurances of that firmness and loyalty. He trusted, that while they felt and lamented the difficulty of the situation in which they were placed, they would also feel indignition as to the means by which it had been produced. In proportion as the prefent conduct of any seamen was central y to that in which their own renown and the prosperity of the country had hitherto consisted, in that proportion the House must see that it had not resulted from the genuine minds and dispositions of British seamen, and must feel it their duty to express a readings for passing such laws as would reftrain or punish any internal enemies, who might aim at sullying the chief glory of the country, or weakening the chief pillar of it's safety. In that proportion they must eager to take measures for counteracting any insidious incitements to mutiny and sedition. It was not now necessary to date full the nature of the measures which would be proposed to them but if the present Address should be carried, it was his intention movef oraß.il; and, in explaining the object of that, he would be more particular. That the offence complained of was frequent, need not say; it was practised with an industry, an art, and, in (' indsnees, with a boldness, which proved the Je p dcfigns those who perpetrated it. That the House had every ground which could required for the palling of any penal law, would not be doubted; it would be his duty only to shew that the remedy proposed was suitable to the moral guilt and real malignity of the crime. And, while Parliament was not wanting to the Public, the Public would not wanting to itfelr; every individual his fpliere, would contribute to the general cause and exertion, which was worthy of Englishmen, in order to feenre the bledings hitherto attached to that nime. Men would join together for the purpose of national defence against all enemies, external and internal. During the continuance of the crisis in which we were, the House would feel it their incessant duty to he vigilant against danger every fort. To say more upon the occasion would be to insult the honour of the House, and impeach the fidelity of the country; and Ihouid have been wanting to his own feelings if he had laid lei's. Mr. Pitt concluded by moving an Address to his Majesty, which was, of course, an echo the Message. Some observations were made by Mr. Joliffe, Mr. W. Smith, Mr. Sheridan, Mr. Dundas, and Mr. Hobboufe, ail of whom concurred in the necessity of a dutiful Address to his Majesty. Mr Sheridan earnestly enforced the necessity of unanimous endeavours to restore that subordination, without which the prosperity of the Country was gone: but he still peifilted his opinion of the culpability and incapacity of Ministers, and dreaded the extension of our penal laws. Mr. Pitt rejoiced in the appearance of unanimity would, he milled, be effective. It would shew, that though Gentlemen Hill retained their difference of opinion other topics, they would ever co-operate when it was necessary to concentrate and point the general force against the common enemy. The Parliament was willing to do its duty, dit now remained for the people, by demonstrating their zeal, to check and disappoint our foes, both internal and external. gain the present unanimity, he would sacrifice every thing but the substance of his measure. Those Gentlemen who objected to the tendency of the Bill would rcc. Ile£f, that they were pledged not to adopt, but only to consider*' of the measure. The question on the Address was then put, and carried nemine contradicente. Mr. Pitt then role, and moved for leave to bring in a Bill lor the better prevention and punishhment of attempts seduce from their egiance an i duty his Majesty's Sea or Land Forces.—That attempts were as frequent as they were malignant was unfortunately a matter of general notoriety. The hand-bills, &c. which had been so profusely distributed amongst the foidiery, were a sufficient proof that the same engines were at work which had unhappily succeeded in disorganizing the Navy. Thefe attempts were not solitary or casual; on the contrary, they were made the same time in distant parts of the kingdom, and in such a manner as to shew that they were made in concert, and were the result of an extensive system. A mutiny was reported to have taken place at Maidstone, and this was lived to the fuldieis at Newcastle, for the yt'-rpofeofinducing them to follow the example.-'—At the hour, the troops at Maidstone were informed that there had been an insurrection at Newcastle. This shewed that the plan was as exrcrsive as it was malignant in its nature. The number of attestations issued by the brave and loyal foidiery was a proof that such attempts were lately multiplied. It was necessary, therefore, to employ some rigour, and to make the penalty of the law keep pace, if it were polGble, \vi;h the malignity of the offence. The existing laws n t deter men from the crime and this of itself, was a sufficient pro ff that they were inadequate to its punishment. The offence was now punishable only as a misdemeanour, by fine and imprisonment. The crime of enticing men to desert was made the object of a particular Statute; but to seduce men to turn their arms against their country was furely an atrocity of a deeper dye. In point of guilt and danger, it went beyond all treason; yet as offence could not be defined with sufficient exaiffnefs, it was not his purpose to make the offender liable to the penalties of treason. He should only propose to make it a case of aggravated ion, and punishable by transportation, at the difcrc the Court. He trusted that this was not doing too much, and he hoped the event would show that he had not done too little. He concluded by moving for leave to bring in the Bill.

Mr. Serjeant Adair, after remarking on the enormity of the crime, expressed his opinion that the crisis called for measures of extraordinary rigour, though of a temporary nature. He was at all times averse to the severity of the Penal laws, and wished that many of them could be swept from the Statute Book. The present measure he must consider, however, as inadequate to the occasion. The offence was, in his opinion, ill described even as an aggravated misdemeanour. The offender in this case would have an opportunity to postpone his trial, when speedy punishment and example were most necessary. In his opinion, at the present moment, the crime should be made *Felony* or *Death*.

Mr. Pitt said, that the proposition of the learned Gentleman was undoubtedly fit matter for deliberation. If the punishment were made more severe, the Bill, of course, must be temporary. The House had their option between the two suggestions, and mignt decide when the Bill was in the Committee.

Mr Baker admitted that a strong remedy was necessary. Not only secret oaths, but oaths of secrecy, had been administered in the Navy. Against these some remedy should be provided, which might prevent the renewal of such practices. 

The Master of the Rolls said, that, as this was to be a misdmeanour with felonious punishment, the difference was little more than a difference in terms.

The Bill was then brought up and read a first and second time, and ordered to be committed for to-morrow.

The Committee on the Newspaper Bill was postponed to Wednesday next. Adjourned.

Kentish Gazette - Tuesday 11 July 1797

The Attorney General said, that he now rose to move for leave to bring in a Bill to prevent the administration of illegal oaths. Some late occurrences had shown the necessity of something of this kind.±At present this offence was punishable at common law, as a high misdemeanour; buut he much doubted whether the community were sufficientiy aware of the illegality of the practice. He considered it therefore, as at once merciful to those whom it was intended to prevent, and wise with regard to the publick, to reduce the language of the common law in the express enactment of a statute to warn them of the crime, and to point out the punishment. It was obvious that such cases had occured where the law was violated, while the person did not know to what extent he was culpable. After they had been seduced and fixed by the bond of an oath, which was meant as the tie to tender sacred the useful intercourse of men, the more firmly in desperate and wicked designs, and afterwards were desirous of returning to their duty, their consciences were embarrassed by the obligation they had incurred. He was happy to observe the scruple, though regretted the instance, as it showed that an oath was still held to be a sacred tie. The object of the Bill then was to prevent such illegal oaths being administered, and to assign such punishment to the offense as might be afterwards judged proper. He hoped no objection would be made to bring in the Bill.

Mr. Pitt observed, that the object of the intended Bill was not merely to warn men against the crime, but to increase the punishment of an which the exiting laws had been found inadequate to repress. He should have thought that the Bill stopped much short of the proper mark, had it not at once contained the warning and enacted the additional punishment. Its object then was to tncincrease the punishment, and what was of no less consequence, to remove the difficulties in the present mode of tryal. The nature of the offense was of the most aggravated kind It struck at the existence of every civil, religious, and military establihhment, on which the happiness and glory of this country depended. It was superfluous to adduce instances, when they were lately so well ascertained. Leave was given, and the Bill brought in and read a first time, and ordered be read a second time on Monday.

Mr. Edward Lyons (Bradford, West)  ...

We are dealing also with two Acts which were famous in their time. The first Act was introduced in 1797 because of a mutiny at Spithead. The Act that was used against the Tolpuddle martyrs was introduced for a different purpose. It was improperly used to introduce severe punishments for taking secret oaths and making secret promises to do certain things. It is encouraging that attitudes have changed considerably since that Act was made law. It has been dormant since 1834. Presumably the main purpose of repealing it is to save paper by making it unnecessary to print it in future and to save lawyers reading excess pages of statute that no longer serve a useful purpose.

The other Act—the Unlawful Oaths Act of 1812—was never implemented. Its purpose and likely effect were much worse than the Act under which the Tolpuddle martyrs were charged. The 1812 Act was introduced in response to Luddism, the wrecking of industrial machinery, and featured the death penalty for taking an unlawful oath. If a person promised to damage property, he could be sentenced to death. Happily the Act was never implemented, and in 1837 the death penalty for taking an unlawful oath was abolished.

I have not read Hansard for 1837, but I imagine that some hon. Members strongly urged the retention of the death penalty for making an unlawful oath and opposed the reform. When a reform is proposed, the instinct of many of us initially is to react and to say "This is against the status quo. This has always been so. Why should we change it?" Laws are made to mirror contemporary attitudes. Attitudes that seem so permanent at the time appear ludicrous, harsh and inhuman to succeeding generations.

Therefore, tonight we are celebrating the passing of those parts of our history. Those Acts were oppressive to ordinary working people and were inhumane and cruel in their intention against anyone who might have been charged under them. Acts such as the Turnpike Acts were relevant to our social history and to the way in which we lived our lives 150 years ago.
