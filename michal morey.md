"A 1755 travellers' guide to London explains to foreign visitors that gibbets were situated on the highway "near the Place where the Fact was done, to perpetuate the Villainy of the Crime, and to serve as an Example" https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1057%2F978-1-137-60089-9_2 citing Anon (1755) London in Miniature (London: C. Corbett), p. 217.

But "Given that the start of assizes is likely to be before the date of conviction in many cases (assize sittings could take up to a week in this period)" https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1057%2F978-1-137-60089-9_2

"The poles from which the cages were hung were often very high — 10 metres or more, which discouraged attempts to rescue the body or to steal the gibbet — and supported chains which comprised a substantial quantity of iron. The post was also sometimes fitted with spikes around the bottom to make it hard to scale. The gibbet post of Adam Graham, executed in 1748 and hung in chains on Kingmoor, Carlisle, was apparently 12 yards high and had 12,000 nails in it to prevent it being scaled or cut down to remove the body." must contain the body and prevent it from either falling out or being removed, while at the same time still maximising its visibility. In order to do this, most gibbet cages were designed to fit closely to the body, allowing as much as possible of the body to be seen, while ensuring that the gaps between bars were too small to remove it. When possible, the prisoner was measured for his irons before execution, but there were other means of ensuring a close fit, notably construction with punched straps and hoops that could be adjusted to size by riveting ... small pieces of the body could easily be removed by animals or birds ... the gibbet cage had to be durable. The body was supposed to remain up there until it had decayed, and as there was no particular time for taking it down, many gibbets remained in their location for decades ...  a gibbet was needed so infrequently that it was not a form within the learned repertoire of most blacksmiths. Moreover, it was needed almost immediately and so left the blacksmith little time to experiment or research other models. Therefore, each blacksmith needed to design a gibbet effectively from scratch https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1057%2F978-1-137-60089-9_2 citing .

https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1057%2F978-1-137-60089-9_2 "The Murder Act specifies that capital sentences for murder should be carried out on the second day after conviction." but "Typically, the body of a criminal was gibbeted within a day or two of being executed, but sometimes there were longer intervals, especially when the body had to be transported some distance to the place appointed for gibbeting." [? what is date of Murder Act?  Rooks and Ravens says execution was immediately following sentence? Murder Act 1751? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_Act_1751
