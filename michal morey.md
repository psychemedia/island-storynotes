"A 1755 travellers’ guide to London explains to foreign visitors that gibbets were situated on the highway "near the Place where the Fact was done, to perpetuate the Villainy of the Crime, and to serve as an Example" https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1057%2F978-1-137-60089-9_2 citing Anon (1755) London in Miniature (London: C.

Micheal Morey, Assize date W 2 March, executed Saturday, 19 March, 1737, Gallows Hill, Winchester http://www.capitalpunishmentuk.org/hants.html

But "Given that the start of assizes is likely to be before the date of conviction in many cases (assize sittings could take up to a week in this period)" https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1057%2F978-1-137-60089-9_2

"The poles from which the cages were hung were often very high—10 metres or more, which discouraged attempts to rescue the body or to steal the gibbet—and supported chains which comprised a substantial quantity of iron. The post was also sometimes fitted with spikes around the bottom to make it hard to scale. The gibbet post of Adam Graham , executed in 1748 and hung in chains on Kingmoor, Carlisle , was apparently 12 yards high and had 12,000 nails in it to prevent it being scaled or cut down to remove the body." must contain the body and prevent it from either falling out or being removed, while at the same time still maximising its visibility. In order to do this, most gibbet cages were designed to fit closely to the body, allowing as much as possible of the body to be seen, while ensuring that the gaps between bars were too small to remove it. When possible, the prisoner was measured for his irons before execution, but there were other means of ensuring a close fit, notably construction with punched straps and hoops that could be adjusted to size by riveting ... small pieces of the body could easily be removed by animals or birds ... the gibbet cage had to be durable. The body was supposed to remain up there until it had decayed, and as there was no particular time for taking it down, many gibbets remained in their location for decades ...  a gibbet was needed so infrequently that it was not a form within the learned repertoire of most blacksmiths. Moreover, it was needed almost immediately and so left the blacksmith little time to experiment or research other models. Therefore, each blacksmith needed to design a gibbet effectively from scratch https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1057%2F978-1-137-60089-9_2 citing .

https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1057%2F978-1-137-60089-9_2 "The Murder Act specifies that capital sentences for murder should be carried out on the second day after conviction." but "Typically, the body of a criminal was gibbeted within a day or two of being executed, but sometimes there were longer intervals, especially when the body had to be transported some distance to the place appointed for gibbeting." [? what is date of Murder Act?  Rooks and Ravens says execution was immediately following sentence? Murder Act 1751? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_Act_1751

« Extract of a Letter from Hampshire.
At the Assizes at Winchester yesterday Se'enight,
an old Fellow of the Isle of Wight, was condemned for the Murder of his Grandson, about 14 Years of Age. He had bred him up from his Cradle ; and the Child having some way or other disobliged him, he took him out with him one Morning about Six o'Clock in June last , on Pretence of going to a
Market-town about seven Miles from him, to buy Necessaries, and carried him into a Wood, and murdered him with a Bill-hook, which he had taken with him for that Purpose. There was no Confession made by the Villain , nor was the Body found till October, when it could only be known by the Hat, Breeches, Stockings, and Shoes, which the Child had on when he went from Home, and which were found with the Body, together with the Bill- hook and the old Man's Gloves. He had cut off his Head , and mangled his Body, and put the whole into two Wallets, which he also carried with him. What cruel Circumstances might attend the Execution of this horrid Fact, is at present only known to God and the Murderer. The old Fellow did not return home till about a Week after the Fact was committed ; and being asked after the Child, and not giving a satisfactory Answer, he
was taken up on Suspicion ; and upon searching a Chest belonging to him, his bloody Shirt ( which was also produced in Court) was found wrapt up in a clean Shirt ; upon which he was committed at the Summer Assizes, and now tried , convicted, and condemn'd, and is to be hanged this Day at Winchester, but in Chains in the Isle of Wight.”
He was accordingly executed on Saturday the 19th of
March, but without making any particular Confession.

*Michael Morey's dead,  
For cutting off his grandson's head,  
He is hung on Arreton Down  
For rooks and ravens to peck down.*  
  
If you turn left out of Robin Hill, past the Hare and Hounds pub, you'll see Burnt House Lane on the right, running down the valley towards Newport.  
  
Back in the early-1700s, just on the hillside to the left of there, lived a woodcutter, Michael Morey, his son and daughter in law, her sister, and James Dove, his grandson.  
  
There is a Morey's building and timber merchants on the island to this day: you'll see their yards just coming into Sandown, from Brading, in Ryde, and in Newport. I don't know if they are related.  
  
James's mother, Michael's daughter, had died giving birth to him fourteen years before; his father had abandoned him and remarried elsewhere on the island.  
  
Early one morning in June, 1736, shortly after sunrise, six a.m. or so, Michael Morey and his teenage grandson left their cottage at Sullens, setting off "on Pretence of going to a Market-town about seven Miles from him, to buy Necessaries", as an old report has it. Between them, they carried some old leather panniers.  
  
Shortly after, Michael must have returned home alone, but then he too disappeared. A week later, Michael returned; "being asked after the Child, he could not give a satisfactory Answer. He was taken up on Suspicion; and upon searching a Chest belonging to him, his bloody Shirt (which was later produced in Court) was found wrapt up in a clean Shirt". He was placed in the care of his son, presumably under some sort of house arrest, and a hue and cry raised to search for James.  
  
Towards the end of July, Michael absconded again. Three days later, he was found again, a small reward paid for his return. Two weeks after that, he was sent to the Big Island, to the mainland, and imprisoned in in Winchester jail on suspicion of murder.  
  
But there was still no sign of James.  
  
Walking through nearby autumnal woods that October, another Arreton parishioner noticed... what? That's odd. Could there be hidden valuables in that old leather bag that seems half buried over there?  Whoo, hoo, this could be my lucky day... But whatever he saw horrified him, and he made haste to summon help.  
  
A jury of witnesses, including the Coroner and the Bailiff, made their way back to the woods. Two half buried satchels were revealed, and opened. An arm here, a leg there, a bill hook for chopping wood, and, was that a head? 
  
The body was unrecognisable, but a description at least of the clothes that still wrapped the putrefying body parts was made.  
  
A gravedigger was summoned — I don't know if he'd ever seen worse — a coffin made and the body quickly interred in the nearby Arreton church graveyard.  

The widowed mother of a neighbouring farmer, who had perhaps at times fashioned clothes for her neighbour's motherless child, had the clothes described to her, but she couldn't be certain they were James'.  
  
And so it was that the next day, James' body was dug up a for a second time. From his Hat, Breeches, Stockings, and Shoes, he was duly identified. He was reburied for a second, or should that be, a third?, time.  
  
The fate of Michael, still in Winchester gaol, was now surely settled; but it was not until February of the next year, 1737, that the great and the good of Arreton Parish met in the vestry of the church there, and grimly determined to pay for Michael's trial on a count of murder.  
  
At the Winchester Assizes starting on Wednesday, March 2nd, Michael stood trial. He made no confession. "What cruel Circumstances might have attended the Execution of th[at] horrid Fact [of murder], [was] only known to God and the Murderer". Michael was sentenced not just to death, but also to hanging in chains thereafter.  
  
There were no football matches on Saturdays in those days, but there were public hangings. A good a spectacle as any you could expect.  
  
And so it was that Michael was executed on Saturday, 19 March, 1737, at Gallows Hill, Winchester.  Hung by the neck until he was dead.  
  
But the story doesn't end there. Only part of the sentence had been fulfilled.  
  
Michael's body was brought back to the island, where it was wrapped in chains, a tightly fitting metal cage, made to measure by a local blacksmith.  
  
His caged body was then hung from a tall wooden gibbet, most likely spiked with nails at the bottom to prevent it from being cut down, on top of an ancient burial mound that overlooks Arreton valley.  
  
The mound is there to this day: we know it as Michal Morey's mound: if you turn left out of the Hare and Hounds, then left again onto the Down's road, you'll see it there to the right, just a few hundred yards down the road. If you're coming along the Down's road from Ryde, it's on the left, a few hundred yards before the T-junction at the end.  
  
Michael's body was never found - murderers would never be buried in consecrated ground. There is a skull on display in the Hare and Hounds that some claim to be Michael's, but whilst it is from the mound that bears his name, it dates from much older times. A memory of the gibbet pole can also be found in the same pub: one of beams, claimed to be the hewn from the pole itself, is carved with the date "1737". Look up in the room at the back, and you'll see it.  
  
Local folk traveling the Down's road to this day still mention seeing a ghostly figure walking nearby the mound, but whether it's the ghost of Michael, or James, or the ancients from the burial mound itself, who can say?  
  
So the next time you visit Robin Hill, listen out for the sound of woodsmen working round about; for the sound of chains clanking against who knows what in the distance; for the call of the birds circling there still.  
  
And bring to mind the playground rhyme learned by so many of Arreton's primary school children over the years:  
  
*Michael Morey's dead,  
For cutting off his grandson's head,  
He is hung on Arreton Down  
For rooks and ravens to peck down.*
