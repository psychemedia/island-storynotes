Midway along the northwest (top left) edge of the Diamond Isle is the old town of Newtown, once known as Frankeville, or Francheville (Freetown). Visitors to Newtown today will perhaps best know it for the nature reserve and the boardwalk that extends out to the old quay and salt ponds; an old [map from 1768](https://townmaps.history.ac.uk/isle-wight-newtown-1768) ['A map of the Borough of Newtown, alias Frankville, in the Isle of Wight in Hampshire... Surveyed in January and February 1768 by James Mallett, Land Surveyor.'] shows the lay of the land two hundred and fifty years ago, in which time not much has changed.

An [Ordnance Survey map of 1896](https://www.francisfrith.com/newtown,isle-of-wight/newtown-1896-1907_hosm70700) shows how industry had moved on a hundred years later to the management of oyster beds just to the northwest of the town. [2021 oyster beds being planned again?]

The name Francheville indicated a 'free town' where land and tenements were held at a fixed rent and the people were mostly free of the usual obligations to perform services for the Lord of The Manor.

Newtown was established by Aymer de Valence, Bishop-elect of Winchester. He sealed its charter in 1256.
On the Island all three medieval new towns were based on a simple grid layout around harbour facilities. Newport, and Yarmouth were established in the 12th century: Francheville (Freetown), later renamed Newtown, was established in the 13th century
Bustling harbour
It has been said that the devastating French raids of 1377, perhaps aggravated by the plague, were a watershed from which Newtown never properly recovered. Later in its history the gradual silting of the harbour coupled with the demands of larger vessels is also cited as contributing to its decline.
By the beginning of the 19th century Newtown had become little more than a rural outpost, its two MPs merely indicative of a political gentry independent of trade. [Rotten borough]
at Newtown much of the street pattern is visible, partly within the fields or as green lanes.

In 1344, it was assessed at twice the value of Newport. Its harbour was busy and reputed to be the safest on the island. There was a prosperous saltworks and abundant oyster beds.
There was an annual three-day festival on the "eve, the day and the morrow of the Feast of St. Mary Magdalen", who was honoured in the name of the local thirteenth-century chapel. Then, the great plague struck, and subsequently a French raid in 1377 destroyed much of the town, from which it never truly recovered.
In 1584 Elizabeth I breathed some life into the town by awarding it two parliamentary seats. A town hall was built in the 17th century. However, these seats ultimately made Newtown borough one of the most notorious of the rotten boroughs, prevalent in the UK before the 19th century reforms. By the time of the 1832 Reform Act that abolished the seats, a survey found that Newtown had just fourteen houses and twenty-three voters, whilst massively larger municipal areas with many more voters had less representation.
There are two square ponds by the boathouse, which were dug as salterns as part of the former local salt industry.
There are stories of a pied piper, hired for 50 pounds to save Newtown from an excess of rats, which are similar to the story of the Pied Piper of Hamelin, Germany. He is said to have played his pipe and led the rats into the Solent, where they drowned. The townspeople refused to pay the agreed price, and gave the piper 20 pounds, so he then led the children away. The town lost an entire generation, so had no young people to defend it when the French attacked in 1377.

As if we didn't disagree enough with our German friends - wars, world cup goals, economics - there is the Pied Piper legend to throw in for good measure. Everyone knows the Hamelin version, of course. But is it the original? Newtown on the Isle of Wight has some claims to the contrary.
The Hamelin Piper story is traditionally given the date 1284, but it first appears in a document dated two centuries later. The Isle of Wight version relates to incidents in the 14th century, i.e. earlier than the written source for Hamelin's story. No less a figure than W.H. Auden wondered if the Newtown tale was the original. We may never know. Maybe mysterious Pied Pipers were ten a penny.
The Norman settlement of Francheville - the previous name for Newtown - on the North west coast of the island was on a fine natural harbour; it had wonderful natural oyster beds to feed its people; there were thick woods behind the settlement to provide firewood aplenty and fodder for their pigs; there was even a very productive saltpan to season local food and provide a very marketable commodity shipped from the port. Everything a medieval town could wish for. And in the mid-14th century the place was indeed prosperous, far more so than Newport .
Yet in 1377 when the French, playing a return leg of the Hundred Years War on English soil, ransacked and ruined the town, there were only men of middle years and their elders to defend it. What happened to the young of Francheville?
Rats and magic. Along with its prosperity Francheville had a rat problem. Cats imported to deal with the plague provided a tasty snack for the giant rodents; traps couldn't keep them down; rat-catchers seemed to have jobs for life. The town's mayor and his aldermen offered a reward, the princely sum of £50, to anyone who could rid the place of the infestation.
Who should appear but a strangely dressed musician, a piper, who said he would cleanse the town in just a day. He marched through every corner of the place - Gold Street, Silver Street, Quay Street and the rest - playing his pipe, though what emerged was a rather stranger sound than mere music. And the rats ran out of barrels and byres and barns; they poured from houses, hayricks and hostelries. Rats in their tens of thousands.
The piper led the vermin down to the harbour, where he boarded a boat which he rowed to the mudflats a little way across the water. The swimming rats that followed him set paw on the mud, and stuck. They drowned to the last one when the tide rose.
Back in Francheville the piper politely requested his reward, £50. Maybe it was not a manifesto commitment, or maybe the mayor fancied keeping some of the money for himself - a corrupt politician, whatever next? It may have been that the mayor thought it had been too easy. But all he offered was £20.
The piper refused the lesser sum, and leaving the mayor he began to walk around Francheville again, playing a slightly different tune. Children flocked to him, entranced by his strange tune. Every child in the place able to walk or crawl fell in behind the magical musician, who to the horror of the adults walked off into the woods behind the town, his infant entourage close behind. Before the shocked parents could react the darkness of the woods closed around the procession. Neither the piper nor the children were ever seen again.
Thus it was that when the French attacked in 1377, only those well beyond their best years remained to resist them. Francheville had lost an entire generation. The ruined town had begun a rapid descent from prosperity to paupery, never recovering its former glory. And all of this because the mayor withheld £30.


https://historicengland.org.uk/listing/the-list/list-entry/1019196
The settlement was founded by the Bishops of Winchester in the mid-13th century and constructed in a planned manner with the two main streets, Gold Street and High Street, running parallel on an east to west axis.
The third area of protection includes an abandoned section of the former Gold Street, north of which are a further series of burgage plots and a smaller east to west orientated street which maps show had fallen into disuse by 1768.
The Bishop of Winchester's Court Roll for the year 1254-5 contains the first documentary reference to the settlement, then recorded as the new borough of Francheville or 'Freetown'. There are known to have been 73 plots in the borough, which was the last of the town foundations of the Bishops of Winchester and probably replaced an earlier settlement called Stretley. There is some evidence to suggest that by as early as 1334 the settlement was already in economic decline and in 1377 it was attacked and burned by French raiders. Two years later 31 households were considered eligible to pay the Lay Subsidy. In 1559 it was recorded that there were then no `good houses' standing, and the 1674 Hearth Tax returns indicate that there were only eleven residences within the town, a number which remained relatively constant until the 20th century. Nevertheless, between 1584 and 1832, when it was disenfranchised, Newtown sent two representatives to parliament.

TUCKED away in the wilds of Newtown there is a street called Gold Street, but don't go looking for it on your satnav.
It will deny all knowledge of any such place, but Gold Street is there all the same.
It's just round the corner from the High Street and up the road from Silver Street.
Today, thanks to the French, Newtown is a nature reserve, home to curlews and oystercatchers, but not long ago the mudflats which attract them there were pasture land, part of Marsh Farm and home to grazing cattle.
The fields disappeared one night in November, 1954, during a raging storm when the sea level rose and was driven onshore by the wind, until eventually the waves breached the seawalls which had kept the Solent out for more than 200 years.
Millions of gallons of seawater instantly flooded more than 100 acres of farmland which was lost to the sea, probably for ever.
For an event that radically changed a large area of the Island, it received little coverage at the time, the County Press devoting just a few lines to the breaching.
In 1877, there were reckoned to be between five and six million oysters in the Newtown and Medina rivers until the entire stock was wiped out in 1880 by a severe frost.
The beds were eventually re-stocked by Cowes fishmongers, Paskins, who then lost almost the entire beds due to oil pollution during the First World War.
And so it did for a while, but in the early 2000s oyster numbers plummeted.
The dreaded tingle was back, some said, and by 2010 the shellfish had all but died out and in 2013 the oyster beds were closed by the Fisheries Agency.
Oyster fisherman Paul Lambert said the decline in the oyster population had been dramatic ­— crews at one time collected between one and two tonnes a day he said; now they were lucky to collect three or four bags full.

The Disturbing True Story of the Pied Piper of Hamelin
READ LATER  PRINT
When, lo! as they reached the mountain-side,  
A wondrous portal opened wide,  
As if a cavern was suddenly hollowed;  
And the Piper advanced and the children followed,  
And when all were in to the very last,  
The door in the mountain-side shut fast.  
Robert Browning, The Pied Piper of Hamelin: A Child's Story

Many are familiar with the story of the Pied Piper of Hamelin. Few realize however, that the story is based on real events, which evolved over the years into a fairy tale made to scare children.

The Pied Piper of Hamelin Story
For those unfamiliar with the tale, the Pied Piper of Hamelin is set in 1284 in the town of Hamelin, Lower Saxony, Germany. This town was facing a rat infestation, and a piper, dressed in a coat of many colored, bright cloth, appeared. This piper promised to get rid of the rats in return for a payment, to which the townspeople agreed.

Although the piper got rid of the rats by leading them away with his music, the people of Hamelin reneged on their promise. The furious piper left, vowing revenge. On July 26 of that same year, the piper returned and led the children away, never to be seen again, just as he did the rats.

Nevertheless, one or three children were left behind, depending on which version is being told. One of these children was lame, and could not keep up, another was deaf and could not hear the music, while the third one was blind and could not see where the other children were going.

The Record Shows No Rats
The earliest known record of this story is from the town of Hamelin itself. It is depicted in a stained glass window created for the church of Hamelin, which dates to around 1300 AD. Although it was destroyed in 1660, several written accounts have survived. The oldest comes from the Lueneburg manuscript (c 1440 – 50), which stated: "In the year of 1284, on the day of Saints John and Paul on June 26, by a piper, clothed in many kinds of colours, 130 children born in Hamelin were seduced, and lost at the place of execution near the koppen." A 1384 entry in Hamelin's town records also grimly states "It is 100 years since our children left."

The oldest known picture of the Pied Piper

The supposed street where the children were last seen is today called Bungelosenstrasse (street without drums), as no one is allowed to play music or dance there. Incidentally, it is said that the rats were absent from earlier accounts, and only added to the story around the middle of the 16th century. Moreover, the stained glass window and other primary written sources do not speak of the plague of rats.

What Actually Happened in Hamelin?
If the children's disappearance was not an act of revenge, then what was its cause for the Pied Piper's actions? There have been numerous theories trying to explain what happened to the children of Hamelin.

For instance, one theory suggests that the children died of some natural causes, and that the Pied Piper was actually a personification of Death. By associating the rats with the Black Death, it has been suggested that the children were victims of that plague. Yet, the Black Death was most severe in Europe between 1348 and 1350, more than half a century after the event in Hamelin.

Another theory suggests that the children were actually sent away by their parents, due to the extreme poverty in which they were living. Yet another theory speculates that the children were participants of a doomed 'Children's Crusade', and might have ended up in modern day Romania.

There is also the suggestion that the departure of Hamelin's children is tied to the Ostsiedlung, in which a number of Germans left their homes to colonize Eastern Europe. Reflecting on this hypothesis, Wibke Reimer, project coordinator at the Hameln Museum, says "In this scenario the Pied Piper played the role of a so-called locator or recruiter. They were responsible for organising migrations to the east and were said to have worn colourful garments and played an instrument to attract the attention of possible settlers."



Yet another suggestion is that this is an account of dance mania, also known as St. Vitus' Dance. This affliction gripped mainland Europe between the 14th and 17th centuries, and has been described as individuals dancing "hysterically through the streets for hours, days, and apparently even months, until they collapsed due to exhaustion or died from heart attack or stroke."

Another of the darker theories even proposes that the so-called Pied Piper was actually a paedophile who crept into the town of Hamelin to abduct children during their sleep. Perhaps the horrible nature of the children's disappearance is the reason why there are few details on what happened. Reimer ponders "Did something happen that officials had been covering up? Something so traumatic that it was transmitted orally for so long in the town's collective memory, over decades and even centuries?"

There may be More Truth Found in Fairy Tales…
Historical records suggest that the story of the Pied Piper of Hamelin was a real event that took place. This could stoke real fear in parent's hearts – worrying whispers that a number of real children have been lost to some frightening unknown force. The transmission of this story undoubtedly evolved and changed over the centuries, although to what extent is uncertain.

The mystery of what really happened to those children has never been solved. The story also raises the question, if the Pied Piper of Hamelin was based on reality, how much truth is there in other fairy tales that we were told as children?
