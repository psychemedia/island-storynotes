# Show Notes â€” An Isle of Wight Miscellany

*Featuring tales and legends from the Isle of Wight.*

- *A Legend of Godshill*: a tale variously told, of how Godshill Church came to be where it can be found today, and hence why the village is so-named. My version is based on the pseudonymous Abraham Elder's telling from the 1840s, taken from his *Tales and Legends of the Isle of Wight* series.

- *The Macabre Tale of Micah Morey*: a story that ends with a body hanging in chains on Arreton Down, but starts early one morning in the 1750s, with a wood-cutter setting off to market with his young nephew...

- *The Three Little Pigs*: a sanitised version of this familiar tale is still told today, but this original is rather less forgiving. Originally collected in Shanklin in the 1850s and published in the 5th edition of Halliwell's *Nursery Rhymes and Nursery Tales of England* in 1853, it was also popularised by its appearance in Joseph Jacobs' *English Fairy Tales* collection of 1890. Andrew Lang also included a saccharine version in his *Green Fairy Book*, 1892.

- *Carus Wilson, Jane Eyre, and Newport, Nursery of Vice*: told as a work-in-progress, and constructed from what I remember from a wide reading of newspaper reports published in the 1840s and 50s. The tale starts in Newport, a playground of drunkeness and vice, where the appearance of a recently retired evangelical preacher with a penchant for publishing inflammatory tracts causes a local outcry and a charge of libel. As the preacher's health fails, a very public debate in the Northern press challenges his character through his links to *Jane Eyre*...
