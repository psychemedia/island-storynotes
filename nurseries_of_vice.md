# Nurseries of Vice

The context for this is a reference I happened across to a pamphlet entitled "Tempter and Tempted" which appears to have ranted against Newport oas a hotbed of vice corrupting the soldiers barracked at Parkhurst. A later pamphlet also became the subject of a libel case against local dignitary, F. Pittis.

I still havenlt managed to track down the pamphlet...

Many of the same names and drinking establishments appear regularly in the court reports (I have not included all reports, so the sample below is skewed) which suggests a possible cast of characters and locations for some sort of telling...

Newport Petty Sessions

Saturday—Before Sir H. P. Gordon, Bart, (chairman), A. J. Hambrough, Esq., and T. Cooke, Esq. 

Rebecca Smith, a common prostitute, was charged by William Stevens with stealing his coat.

It appeared that the complainant went into field to fight with another man and the defendant held his coat for him and he had never seen it since, but there being no proof against the prisoner that she stole the coat she was discharged in this case, but was then charged with stealing a book, " Light Hearts and Happy Days," from the shop of Mr. Frank Etheridge.

Mr. Etheridge deposed to having seen the book produced in his shop about a week since, and swore to its being his property by the private mark he had written in it and bv his own stamp, which was in the book.

William Bolton, an acting corporal the Rifle Brigade, said that last Monday evening he met the prisoner in the barrack-yard Parkhurst, and that she went into his room with him and another man, and from thence into the canteen, where she showed him the book now produced and asked him if he would like to read it, and when they left the canteen she gave it to him, and he said he would return it to her the next evening, but the next morning he gave it to the pay Serjeant, who, in his presence, gave it to the police constable now present.

P.C. Purchase, being sworn, said—I apprehended the prisoner last Monday night about quarter to 10 o'clock, on Hunnv-hill, on the charge of stealing a coat, handkerchief, and some money, belonging to William Stevens. I asked her where the red-cover book was that she had been reading that day, and she said she returned it to its owner. I asked her who that was and she said, you have got that to find out, but she afterwards told me that it belonged to a soldier. The next morning I went to the barracks and obtained the book of a serjeant in the presence of the last witness. I saw the prisoner the same day, and asked her where she got it from but she did not say. I took her to Mr. Etheridge's shop this morning, as she had told me she had bought a pennyworth of paper and an envelope there, to see if they (Mr. Etheridge, his wife, and daughter, who served the shop) knew her, and when there I said to her, where was the book, on the glass case or with those books (some that were together on the counter) you can tell me or leave it alone, it will neither make it better worse. She said, I took it off the glass case.

The prisoner had nothing to say in defence, and she was committed to the Sessions.

It appeared that she had also been committed on the Wednesday previous for stealing a memorandum book from Mr. John Mew's shop.


[TH: also the following tragic tale]

An inquest was held at the Medina-inn, on the 17th inst., before F. Blake, Esq., coroner, on the body of a new-born female child.

Joseph Read, being sworn, said— I live in Quaystreet, Newport. Yesterday afternoon, about 3 o'clock, I was coming from the Grove into Newport. My attention was directed to something in the stream near Sea-street. I got it out, and found it was the body of a child—the body which has now been viewed by the jury. It was tied up in part of the lining of a gown, and part of a brick was also enclosed. It was tied in two knots, and pinned at the edges. The lining and brick are now produced. The brick was not near the head of the chiid. It was a female child. I observed a bruise on the fore head. It was near Mr. Hallett's coal wharf. I delivered the body to Mr. Cross, the landlord of the Medina inn, Newport. The brick was clear of the body, hung in the string the bundle.

Thomas Denness was next examined, and said— Yesterday afternoon, about one o'clock, I saw bundle tied up and pinned. It resembled the wrapper now produced. It was near the hatch of St. Cross' mill. That was about 300 yards from the place described by the last witness. I tried to reach it, and touched it with my foot. On my touching it, it fell over the hatch. It fell heavy. It was then high water. It must have fallen seven or eight feet—probably two feet of water when it fell.

Mr. Robert Horlock, surgeon, then said— I first saw the body of deceased about four o'clock yesterday afternoon. I examined the forehead and found it had a dark appearance, and there appeared to be extravasted blood beneath the scalp. The face was also a great deal discoloured. The left arm was lying across the upper part the chest, and the flesh of the arm quite flattened. An impression upon the chest where the arm had been lying across the body. The right arm in a flexed position. The umbilical cord had been divided close to the navel, apparently with an instrument, either scissors or a knife; but no ligature had been applied. A medical man or a midwife would have applied a ligature. The legs and thighs were also flexed and flattened. I think the body must have been tied up in the bundle while warm. There was eccleymosis of the blood-vessels on the arms and thighs, which prove that circulation had taken place after delivery. It was a full-grown female child. I should say that it had been dead more than a week—between a week and a fortnight. Decomposition had commenced on the surface. On turning the body over, I observed a good deal of crepitation under the left shoulder. I afterwards made an internal examination of the body. On opening the chest, I found the lungs and heart perfectly healthy. The vessels on the right of the heart, and the pulmonary vessels were much congested. The lungs appeared red and healthy ; and on making an incision into the lungs, blood flowed. It crepitated to the touch. I have not the slightest doubt that the child was born alive. I put a portion of the lungs into water, and they floated. The stomach was perfectly empty. The child had never taken food. The bladder was also empty, which showed that the child must have passed water after its birth. I then removed the scalp ; and underneath the scalp, on the right and upper side of the forehead, over the frontal bone, there was considerable quantity of extravasated blood. No extravasation under the other portion of the scalp. There is a membrane which covers the bone, (called the pericranium) and there was extravasated blood between that membrane and the bone. The place of the extravasation corresponded with the black appearance in the forehead; and I should think it was occasioned by a blow from a blunt instrument, as it did not cause any wound. On opening the head, I found the membrane of the brain a good deal congested, more particularly underneath the frontal bone, corresponding with the extravasation externally. That might have arisen from the same injury. The injuries which I found in the head, were sufficient to have caused death ; and I consider they must have been inflicted while the child was alive. It was a very fine child, and I could find nothing to account for its death from natural causes. If the mother had been delivered while standing, and the child had fallen on a stone floor, it is possible, though not probable, that it may have sustained injuries such as I have described. The injury might have been occasioned either from heavy fall a hard floor, or from a blow from a blunt or flat instrument.

Verdict,— " The deceased was found dead, and that death was occasioned by injuries received on the head, but no sufficient evidence to shew whether the injuries were inflicted wilfully or accidentally."

NEWPORT PETTY SESSIONS. Saturday.—Before Rev. R. W. White (chairman), Sir John Simeon, Bart., Sir H. P. Gordon, Bart., the Hon. W. aCourt Holmes, and Capt. Kerr.

William Bagwell was charged with stealing a sovereign from the trowers pocket of Joseph Buckett.

It appeared that the complainant and the prisoner were "navvies" working together at West Cowes, lodged together, and occupied the same sleeping apartment. When the complainant went to bed on Thursday night last he left his purse in his trowsers pocket. It contained a sovereign, three half-crowns, two or three shillings, and four sixpences. In the course of Friday morning he had occasion to go to his purse, when he missed the sovereign. He went to bed before the prisoner, and did not hear the prisoner go. No one else slept in the same room.

Ellen Vine (a common prostitute) deposed to having been with the prisoner the next day at an eating house at Cowes, where he changed a sovereign.

Committed to the Sessions.

Isle of Wight Observer - Saturday 10 June 1854

NEWPORT PETTY SESSIONS.

Saturday.—Before Rev. R. W. White, chairman ; Sir H. P. Gordon, Bart., Sir John Simeon, Bart., Hon. W. aCourt Holmes, and A. J. Hambrough.

George Lang and Charles King, the two privates of the 93rd regiment, who were remanded from Thursday last for breaking into the Riding School at Parkhurst barracks, and stealing therefrom several articles from the baggage which was stored away there, were again brought forward.

Richard Gough, color sergeant of the 77th depot, stationed at Parkhurst, was first examined, and said— I do not know either of the prisoners. Part of the articles now produced were my charge. On Tuesday morning last, having heard of a robbery being committed in the riding school at the barracks, I immediately went to see if any of the packages that were left in charge by Colonel Graham Egerton, of the 77th regiment, on his leaving England with the regiment for Constantinople, were disturbed. I found that a bed vellese had been opened and a buffalo's skin, a pair of blankets, bolster, two feather pillows, pilot jacket, and a polka cloak had been taken out of it. About the 17th ult. I had the vellese taken to my quarters to be aired. I saw it unpacked, and afterwards packed the things in myself. It was taken back to the riding school on the 23rd. It was fastened by buckles, and not locked. It was never opened at my quarters after I packed it. I know it was full when taken back to the riding school, because it took two men to carry it. The riding school is not locked during the day, but whether it is at night I am not aware. On the 24th I put my hand inside the package to see if the things were all right, and found that they were. On coming from church to the parade ground we had to pass through the riding school to get to the parade ground. When I came out of church last Sunday I turned round and looked at the vellese and saw that it was quite tight, and just as had previously left it. All the things I have mentioned, except the pilot jacket which is not here, are those now produced. I believe there were other packages broken open belonging to the 95th regiment, but I only had charge of those of the 93rd.

Elizabeth Sterrett, a common prostitute, living in the Tontine yard, Cosham-street, Newport, was next examined, and said—On Tuesday morning last, about half-past seven, the prisoner Charles King brought to my house a bundle tied or rolled up in something black like a coat or cloak. He said he found it, and asked me to let it stop at my house a bit. I said yes. He did not open it, nor did I. He took it upstairs into my bedroom. He came down stairs again, and remained there till the police constable came, about ten o'clock the same morning. He gave no account of where he got it. A girl from Portsmouth was having some breakfast with me when he came. I left them together in my house and went across the yard to the public house, and whilst there the policeman came and asked me if knew Charles King, and I said yes. He said, where is he. I said in my house. He asked me if he had brought a bundle. I said yes. I told him to go in and look for it. I told him to go up stairs. I went with him. King was in the house, concealed in the cupboard. The policeman brought down the bundle and opened it in my presence. There were four articles in it; a blanket, pillow, cloak, and pair of boots. I cannot swear that those now produced were the articles the policeman took away. I have not seen the prisoner Lang since somewhen last week. I saw King at the Tontine public house about seven or eight on Monday evening.

Jane Lock, another of those unfortunate girls, living in the same yard as the last witness, said— I know the prisoners. I saw King on Monday night. On Tuesdav morning, about half-past seven, I saw him in the Tontine yard. I was in a neighbour's house the time. When I went into my own house, I saw some things there. It was about half-an-hour before I went to my own house. I did not see King away, or what become of him. When I went up stairs I saw a blanket and pillow had been put on my bed, and when I came down stairs again and looked in the cupboard, I found some wet shirts and a sheet. The blanket and pillow were laid loose on the bed as if they belonged to the bed. I am sure they were not there when I left the house. Just after I found these things my house King came in, and I asked him if he had brought the things and put them where I found them. He said, yes. I begged him to take them away. He said he would presently. He had nothing else with him. I then went out and King followed. I went across the yard. I returned in about ten minutes and found the pillow was gone. King was then in Elizabeth Sterritt's. I went into him and asked him if he had taken the pillow. He said, yes. I said to him, I wish you would come and take the rest away. He said he was going home bye-and-bye and he would take them with him. Whilst I was talking to Mrs. Sterritt P.C. Hobbs and the picquet came up the yard. The policeman took charge of the things and carried them away. I did not see anything of Lang.

P.C. Hobbs deposed to having gone with P.C. Purchase in search of the prisoner King, and to having found, at the witness Lock's house, four wet shirts, a wet sheet, and blanket, which he produced; and that he afterwards went to the barracks with Purchase, who took from Lang's foot a shoe and compared it with some footmarks in a garden adjoining the riding school, through which the prisoners must have have passed with the things to get from the barracks unseen, and which marks corresponded exactly with Lang's shoe.

P.C. Purchase was next examined, and said— In consequence of information I received on Tuesday morning last, I went to the barracks and received from Sergeant Gough a list of some things that had been stolen. I then went into the riding school and through a door at the side leading into little garden, where I saw some footmarks. There was another door in the garden which led into the summer parade field. Some new buildings had been erected near the garden, and the clay from the foundation had been thrown into the garden which, being quite soft, made the footmarks very plain. There were the marks of the feet of two men in the direction of the field from the door. I got some stones and covered up some of the plainest of the tracks. I then went to the Sergeant Major and asked him if there were any men absent last night. He said, Charles was. I then came into Newport, and went into the Tontine yard with P.C. Hobbs—four soldiers came down with me. I went into the witness Sterritt's house and went up stairs, and received from her a blanket, a polka cloak, pair of boots, and a coat. She said, King had brought them there. I now produce the things. I then came down stairs and apprehended King; he was concealed in a cupboard. I told him I should take him into custody for stealing those things from the riding school. He said, then you'll take me for what I haven't done. As I was coming to the station house with him custody, I said him, how do you account for having those things in your possession? He said, I found them on the side of the road between the barracks and the toll-gate. I asked him, when ? He said, last night, just after nine o'clock, when I was going to the barracks, just after the first tattoo, I picked them and brought them into the town; I was late, and I stopped absent.

From further information I received, I went to the barracks again in the afternoon with Hobbs. I went to Lang's quarters where he was, and told him I must have his shoes to compare with some footmarks. He took them off. I then went to the garden and compared them with the footmarks there, and they corresponded exactly. I now produce the shoes. I then went back to Lang's quarters and took him into custody. The buffalo skin and the other pillow were found in the field.

This being all the evidence there was against Lang the magistrates thought it insufficient, and discharged him.

Adam Mc'Pherson, sergeant of the 93rd Regiment, said— I know the prisoner King. I have known him for eight years. I was on duty on Monday night, and he was reported absent from tattoo. I remained on duty till Tuesday afternoon two o'clock ; during which time he did not come to the barracks. On Sunday and Monday he was on duty as sentry at the riding school, which gave him an opportunity of seeing what was there. Sometimes the door of the riding school is not locked at night. During the night of the 29th ult., about twelve o'clock, the sentry at that post reported that some one had broken into the riding school. In consequence of which I went over, and discovered the side door which leads into the garden open. I saw the top partly off one box and the things in a ruffled state. That box belonged to the 77th Regiment. The baggage of five different Regiments was there. A box belonging to the 95th had also been disturbed.

The prisoner said, I am guilty of having the things, but not of taking them. I found them on the road-side. I never looked to see what they were; if I had known what they were, I would have had nothing to do with them.

Committed to the Sessions.

The prisoner was then charged with and committed for stealing the shirts from the washhouse at the barracks, they being identified by the woman who was washing them the day before.

Joseph Anderson, of the Crab and Lobster publichouse, was charged with keeping his house open for the sale of beer after 10 o'clock on Sunday night, the 21th ult.

P.C. Lockhart said— I went to the defendant's house in company with P.C. Cave at twenty minutes to 11 on the night in question and heard persons in the house. I stopped at the front door and Cave went to the back door. Cave knocked at the back door and some oue asked who it was, and he said, the police. The person did not open the door but went back again into the house. I heard a scuffle in the house afterwards. I rapped several times at the front door, and I heard the defendant say to a boy inside, Why don't you open the door or go and see who it is. A female made replv and said, you know who it is, it is the police. The defendant then came to the door and asked who it was. I told him, the police. He opened the door, and I asked him who he had in his house. He said, no one. I told him he had for I heard them. He again said he had no one; he would not do anything against the law if he knew it, for ever so. I went to the back door and let Cave in. We searched the house and found two men in a cupboard in the back room, two in the coal hole and in the yard, one the water closet. There were cups the sideboard that had been used for beer, and there was a quart cup and a glass half-full of beer in the other room. I told him I must report him. He said he hoped I should not.

In defence, Anderson Baid no beer had been drawn since ten minutes before 10 o'clock; but, of course, such an excuse would not satisfy the magistrates, and they fined him 20s. and 5s. costs.

Monday.— Before C. W. Estcourt, Esq., mayor; and E. Way, Esq.

Joseph Anderson, of the " Crab and Lobster" beer shop, was charged with keeping his house open for the sale of beer after the time allowed by law, and secreting soldiers at such times.

P.C. Cave, said — I went to defendant's house about half-past 11 o'clock on Monday night, the 19th of February, with the picket, in search of absent soldiers. I was admitted, and defendant's wife said no soldiers were there. Defendant was present. I went to the coal hole door and found it tied inside. I broke the string, and found a soldier concealed in the corner of the coal hole. I asked defendant and his wife if they had any more in the house, and they said, no. I then went up stairs and found two girls sitting by the fire, and two soldiers lying under the bed.

P.C. Hobbs, said—I went to the defendant's house with the picket, on the night of the 19th of February, at about half-past 10 o'clock, and found three soldiers in the kitchen. The picket took them away, and when they got to Nodchill they escaped from the picket. I went back to the house about half-past 11 o'clock with the last witness. P.C. Cave asked if there were absent soldiers there, and Mrs. Anderson denied that there were. We found one soldier tied in the coal hole, and two up stairs. They were the same three soldiers who had been taken from the house. On Sunday last, about 12 o'clock at night, I went to defendant's house, and saw a soldier in the kitchen. I asked the defendant's wife if there were any more. She said, no. I then went up stairs and found soldier bed with a common prostitute. There were two other prostitutes on the second floor, and two men with them. I believe one of the women was a lodger, but not the other women nor the men. I then came down stairs, and Mrs. Anderson let another soldier out of the back door. There are great complaints of the house from the neighbours.

The defendant was fined £2, and 5s. costs, and in default of paymeut committed to the house of correction for a month.

BOROUGH SESSIONS. Monday.—Before C. W. Estcourt, Esq., mayor ; E. Way, and W. M. Wavell, Esqrs.

Joseph Rands, shoemaker, was summoned by Rosa Jager for using profane and obscene language to her.

Mr. Beckingsale appeared for the defendant, and contended that the magistrates had no jurisdiction in the matter; for, even admitting that the language complained of had been used, it was in the defendant's own house, and neither the Act or the By-Law authorised them to interfere with any man for making use of such language in his own house.

The magistrates did not agree with Mr. Beckingsale that his arguments applied to the present ease, as it occurred in the front shop, which was a public place, and it was not a private quarrel in the family.

The complainant then said—I am the wife of August Jager, a German. Mv husband works for Mr. Rands. Last Thursday week I took some work home to Mr. Rands' shop, and went in three times for the money, He said he had no change and could not pay me, and abused me. I told him my husband wanted the money.

Cross-examined by Mr. Beckingsale—I work with my husband at the trade. We have been making slippers for Mr. Rands. He only paid 6d. for making a pair of slippers. [Mr. Rands : I give them 3s. a dozen more than they get in London.] He did complain to them bout a pair being made bad, but how could he expect them made better for sixpence ? He did not say he would not pay me till I got him the last my husband had that belonged to him. He said he had no change.

George Frederick Mills, a little boy, was then called by Mr. Beckingsale and stated that he was in the shop all three times when the complainant was there, and that Mr. Rands did not make use of any such language that mentioned the complainant. The case was then dismissed.

BOROUGH COURT. Monday.— Magistrates present : The Mayor (C. W. Estcourt), and R. M. Wavell. esqrs.

 "Othello's Occupation Gone."— Joseph Anderson, the notorious occupier of the Crab and Lobster beer-shop (who is just out of Winchester Gaol), was again summoned, for " not being able to keep magistrates' hours," as he terms it.
 
Police-constable Hobbs stated that last Sunday week he went to the house of the defendant, at three o'clock in the afternoon, and found the front door open. There were between forty and fifty soldiers in the house, and some prostitutes; they were sitting about drinking beer. He went there with a piquet the other night, and they found six girls in bed.

Police constable Stubbs deposed that last Tuesday night, at half-past eleven, he caught about eight couple of men and women there. There were beer-cups on the table, and they were sitting down, listening to defendant singing, "John Anderson my Joe John." Stubbs remonstrated with him, and he merely remarked, that would make another charge against him.

Police-constable Cave proved the service of the summons. The man was not there, and his wife would not take it. She said her husband should not appear. He read the summons over, and put it down in the passage ; he then left. She ran after him, and told him he might light his pipe with it, &c., throwing the summons after him.

Mr. Inspector Grapes recited several cases of previous conviction. He was called in Court, but no one answered, and the Mayor then adjudged the defendant to be fined £20, the licrnse of the house to be cancelled, and himself to be disqualified for selling beer for two years. In default of payment of the fine, to be committed to Winchester Gaol for two months.

Petty Sessions

Saturday.—Before Sir H. P. Gordon, Bart., Chairman ; Sir John Simeon, Bart.; Capt. Hamond, R.N.; Capt. Crozier, R.N.; and Thomas Cooke, Esq.

James Caffrey, a private in the 77th Regiment, servant to Philip Daucey, Esq., ensign, stationed at Parkhurst Garrison, was charged with stealing a coat, waistcoat, a gold enamelled ring, a gold pin, a set of gold shirt studs, set of coral studs set gold, a pair of gold and a pair of silver wrist studs, the property of his master.

Mr. Daucey, on being sworn, said —the prisoner was my servant and had access to my room and the charge of everything therein. On the 7th of May he left me, and after he had gone I looked over my things to see if anything had been taken, and I then missed the articles now named in the charge. They had all been taken from my drawer or from the mantle-piece. The drawer was not kept locked. I did not see any of the articles after I had missed them, until yesterday morning, when they were shown to me by the Sergeant of Police. The prisoner was absent from the barracks from Monday morning until the next Sunday morning, when he was brought in as a deserter. I can swear that the things now produced are those I lost.

Thomas Green, jun., chimney sweep at Newport, deposed to buying the coat of the prisoner for 2s. 6d. and an old coat.

Anne Jones, a common prostitute, living in Paradise-row, Newport, deposed to having received the ring from the prisoner and afterwards leaving it in the care of her landlady, Mrs. Leonard, who gave it up to the Police.

Elizabeth Pragnell, of the Oyster-shell houses, near Newport, said the prisoner came to her house in private clothes, with a girl, and asked to be allowed to stop there the night, which he did, and that he represented himself to belong to some ship about to be paid off at Portsmouth, and left with her the gold pin and studs for 15s., saying that he would take them again of her when he received his money.

P.S. Stannard then deposed to receiving the articles which he now produced of the several witnesses, and to taking the prisoner into custody. Committed to the sessions.

Isle of Wight Observer - Saturday 06 October 1855

During the last week a deputation, consisting of the clergymen of St. Thomas' Church, the ministers of the different dissenting congregations and others, presented the following memorial to the magistrates at the Townhall respecting the social condition of the borough, in the hope that means may be taken to prevent a continuation the present exhibition of indecency and open prostitution which now disgrace its thoroughfares :—

"To the worshipful the Mayor and the Magistrates of the borough of Newport, Isle of Wight.

"The memorial of the undersigned inhabitants of the said borough.

"Your memorialists beg respectfully to state that for some time they have, with many respectable inhabitants, had their attention turned to the moral aspect the borough of Newport.

"A few of the more serious part of the community are laboring, by appliances of a simple, but they trust efficient character, to rectify existing evils; but they fear that, without the cooperation which the municipal authorities can afford, their effort, however well intended, and however admirably conducted, will meet with counteractions too powerful, humanly speaking, for them to surmount.

"Without wishing to cast any reflection upon the municipal authorities, your memorialists request permission to suggest, whether the leading thoroughfares of the borough might not be kept more free from interruption, occasioned by individuals collecting in groups, and frequently conducting themselves in a manner most offensive to virtue — whether the By-Law No. 25 ['Every common prostitute, or night walker, who shall loiter or in any thoroughfare or public place for the purpose of prostitution or solicitation, shall for such offence forfeit and pay the sum of ten shillings'] could not be put in force, so that by its rigorous execution obstructions to a course of immorality might lawfully created — whether a stricter supervision could not be exercised over lodginghouses, lest they become the resort of characters for whose use they were not intended, and over public houses and beershops, multiplied, your memorialists fear, far beyond the wants of the borough, and where attractions are held out to make them the rendezvous of persons whose antecedents create a suspicion that they will prove nurseries of vice.

"In imploring the magistrates to exercise their authority for the prevention of crime as far as they can, your memorialists wish to be distinctly understood that they are not seeking any class legislation; their object being the purification of the borough from the social evils which unhappily abound within it, and it is their wish to see every offender, whatever be his grade in life, made amenable for his conduct. Any partial application of the law they would deprecate, for intelligent observers of passing events must see that ail efforts to cleanse the fountains of social life are invariably unpopular and fail, unless even-handed justice be administered all transgressors.

"In conclusion, your memorialists would observe that they address you, not as the organ of any political party, or of any religious denomination, but as inhabitants of the borough, deeply concerned for its highest welfare. Upon your aid they rely as invaluable auxiliary to the various benevolent agencies which are now operating for its social and moral improvement. Their aims, they are free to confess, partake of high and sacred character. On an arm more powerful than that which is human, and on means more effective than any legislation can afford, they depend for their ultimate attainment; but as the work is great, and hindrances from various causes multiply, they desire every kind legitimate of cooperation, and that which an intelligent and a vigilent magistracy can afford they appreciate too highly not to seek, and which, from the known character of the gentlemen who sit upon the beach, they feel pursuaded they shall not seek in vain.

"And your memorialists respectfully subscribe their names hereto."

Dr. Wavell, on the part of the magistrates, replied that the bench would do everything in their power to remedy the evils complained of.

Newport, Saturday, October 6.

The Retrograding State of Morals in Newport.

We omitted last week the following memorial, lately presented by the Rev. G H. Connor and other gentlemen to the Magistrates of the borough on this momentous and anxious subject. We have been so earnestly solicited to print the document that we give it insertion against our own inclinations, being unwilling to believe that there exists in the Isle of Wight a place so lost to Christianity, and so devoted to crime, beyond the crying evils of any other place in the kingdom. We are unwilling to believe it. If true, it does not say much in regard to precept and example. The Question arises— how is it that such a social ulceration has been left to fester amidst the general moral healthiness of the island !— to such an extent, too, as thus to meet the severe condemnation of the immediate residents, who *taboo* the town, and will prevent strangers approaching its scenes of vice. Our correspondent says—" We trust all those of the town who have thought seriously of the matter will exert them-selves in every way to *stem the torrent of juvenile profligacy and prostitution*, the streams of which literally choke up our priucipal thoroughfares of an evening:" This is a horrible picture, and is more out-spoken than the memorial.

[The memorial is then printed in full.]

The worshipful the mayor Dr. Wavell, and others of the authorities present, thanked the memorialists for their judicious suggestive hints, and were pleased in feeling that they had the willing co-operation of the respectable inhabitants of the borough.

Isle of Wight Mercury - Saturday 09 February 1856

The Mayor rose, and said, that he should not be doing justice to his own feelings or to the town if he did not bring before the Council the grows insult which had been cast on them by the address, the Tempter and Tempted, written, it was said, by a gentleman lately come to reside there, the Rev. Carus Wilson, and it was with no ordinary feelings of indignation that he found the beastly tract had been taken to his house, and was in the hands of his family and female domestics; could any honest man, could any father of a family avoid feeling grieved that such gross accounts of vice should be brought to defile the minds of young persons? He was more astonished and indignant to find that copies had been delivered to the children at the Sunday schools, and the National schools. He hoped the British schools had escaped the pollution. He considered these females who distributed such a work and placed them in the hands of children a disgrace to their sex. He regretted that these meddling troublesome fellows who were interfering where they had no connection with the towu, and he should have thought that Mr. Smith might have found other ditties for which he was paid by the Treasury, rather than interfering with the town of Newport. He felt it his duty to deny most clearly, and to protest most strongly against the falsehoods and calumnies which had been circulated respecting the Borough of Newport. He asserted firmly, and would prove his assertion that there were few more moral towns than Newport and no garrison town where there was so little debauchment. He could prove by official returns which he had obtained, that the health of the soldiers their general morality, while at Parkhurst, were much above the average. He could not have allowed the Council to have separated without throwing off the foul imputation, and pressing from his heart the indignation he felt at the insult that had been put on them, and the town.—Mr. W. B. Mew concurred io the sentiments and feelings expressed by the Mayor, and denounced the exaggerated statements about the town, which haul been put forth.—Mr. Robert Pinnock congratulated the Council on the course taken by the Mayor, to revel the calumnies which had been indulged in thousands of the books, had been circulated, and unless contradicted, migbt cling to the town. He asked the Mayor whether he would take it up as the organ of the Council, & repudiate the calumnioues attack on the town. Its origin could be traced to a new movement that had been organized in the memorial addressed to the Magistrates, and to a newspaper paragraph. He considered that the sooner such proceedings were discouraged the better.—Mr. Pring said the memorial had been handed to the Watch Committee, of which he was one, and after the strictest investigation, they came to an unanimous vote, that there was no cause to interfere with tie general arrangements. He had lately been in most of the towns in the kingdom where the military were near, and he said with confidence, that Newport for order, quietness and morality, surpassed all the others. Some persons were over nice, and he thought the Town Clerk might as will stay at home, as to go about interfering with others.—Mr. Eldridge (Town Clerk), said he was one of those who agreed with the memorial; he thought it was quite right, and no censure ought to be cast on those who were parties to it. The attention of the Magistrates was called to facts which were patent to all Gentlemen, and if those present had seen the report of the Town Missionary, which Dr. Wavell and himself had presented to them weekly, they would know the amount of vice which prevailed.—The Mayor said they had no right to sit in judgment upon others, they had no authority to judge and collect accusations against their neighbours. If this was the occupation of a Town Missionary, the sooner he was removed the better.—Mr. Eldridge said he knew that he had lifted up many who had been cast down, and he could tell of those in higher places, whose conduct would not bear investigation.—Mr. Pinnock said that the missionary was engaged to raise up the frail, but the course pursued by him and his employers, had turned out a curse to the town.—Mr. Wilkins and Mr. Morgan expressed similar feelings with the other members of the Council.—Mr. W. B. Mew wished to know by what authority these men had set up this court of inquisition; he felt indignant at their presumption. There was a newspaper once circulated in the town, called Paul Pry, which was very objectionable, and caused unpleasantness in many families but this was much worse, as the scandal was handed from one to the other, without the knowledge of the person whose reputation was attacked. If this Paul Pry defended by Mr. Eldridge, went into these abodes of sin and temptation, he ought to be exceedingly good; as pitch could not be handled without defilement. The exposure that day should induce the Town Clerk to cut such acquaintance, and he could not help feeling disgusted that men should be found, who could listen to the reports, full of scandals and libels on their neighbours.—The Mayor said he was afraid there was a great deal too much of spying and prying going on. After a long conversation, it was determined that it should be left to the Mayor either to write in his own name to the Rev. Carus Wilson or in that of the Council contradicting his statements, as embodied in the address "Tempters and Tempted." Since the meeting of the Town Council and the exposure of the system of espionage which has been carried on in Newport, principally by the means of the town missionary, Mr. Tucker, several subscribers have determined to have their names struck as they never contemplated that they were paying their money to gratify the curiosity of individuals, or to rake up scandal against their neighbours.

NEWPORT, Saturday, February 9.

Town Council Meeting

The quarterly meeting of the Newport Town Council took place on Tuesday.

...

The Reported Immoral State of the Inhabitants of Newport

The Worshipful the Mayor rose and said, there was one painful matter affecting the interests of the town which he considered it his duty, as their chief Magistrate, to bring before the Council. His feelings had been lately shocked on finding that a disgusting pamphlet, entitled, "Tempters and Tempted," had been industriously circulated about the town, and by one means and the other had found ita way into almost every house ; and he was sure he was sharing the feelings of every, rightminded head of a household, when he said that such vile slaader against their town as was therein contained ought to be emphatically and publicly protested against— (hear, bear). He could not express the indignation he felt on learning its contents, and finding that everyone in his bouse, excepting his wife, had read its contaminating pages; and greatly astonished was he tof ind that those tracts had been placed in the hands of the children of their Churcb Sunday and other schools by females— he would not say by ladies. He would ask if expressions such as these— "Your town is on fire with the flames of licentiousness and lust" — were fit for the minds of tender children to dwell upon? And were they not a gross insult, and a libel on the inhabitants of the town ? And by wbom was this shameful tract written? Not by one of the pastors or ministers of the town, but by a non-resident, wbo had nothing whatever to do with the town, assisted by another meddling, tronblesome busybody, who, he should think, would be far better employed in his business at the Prison at Parkhurst. The parties to the tract were Carus Wilson and Henry Smith; that was an undisguised fact, and the stigma with which the town had been branded would doubtless be most pernicious to the interests of it ; and he did say they (the Corporation) ought to do all in their power to destroy its baneful influence. The assertions in it respecting the general depravity and debauchery of our town were infamously false. There was not a garrison town in England that was so free from the charge as Newport— (hear, hear), and he had it from undoubted authority thht there had always been less average disease in the Garrison at Parkhurst than at any other, arising from such vicious habita as are imputed to our town. He would, therefore, once again say, that these infamous and unfounded assertions respecting their borough ought to be thus publicly denounced— (hear, hear).

Mr. Pinnock said he was proud their Chief Magistrate had shown the moral courage thus to speak out against a matter which ciations than the Mayor had, and desire him to take such further was calculated to be a most serious injury to the town, if not thus publicly disclaimed. And they ought to go further in their denun- steps as be might deem expedient to stop the thing— (hear). For such a false and shocking report of the state of morals of the inhabitants of Newport waa unjust to the Magistracy of the Borough, and he regretted to be obliged to further state that some of the members of their Council had been, in a measure, parties to it. They first had their attention drawn to the immoral state of the town by their Town Clerk, some of the ministers of religion, and other parties living in the town, waiting on the Magistrates, at tne Town Hall, as a deputation, requesting them to lend their influence, in their public capacity, to suppress vice and immorality in the town; then there were paragraphs in the newspapers on the subject; and at last there were found religious fanatics ready to make a handle of those pharisaical " good intentions," and scandal was the consequence, which if not met in some such way as this, the town was likely to suffer most seriously. He had some knowledge of other military towns, and it was with thankfulness he felt that Newport was a paradise in comparison with any of them.

Mr. W. B. Mew fully coincided in the censures which bad been passed on the authors and circulators of this most injudicious and injurious tract.

Mr. Pring considered at the time that the said deputation took upon themselves to wait upon the Council and lecture them upon the immoral state of the town, that they were going somewhat out of their way, and could not help thinking that their worthy Town Clerk, who headed that deputation, would have been better employed in his office. However, they thought perhaps there were some matters which might be rectified, and instructed their police to be watchful and keep the streets clear, and people moving; and their inspector had shown that generally speaking there was no necessity for interference except on Sundays, and then it was a delicate matter, as people stood about talking with each other after coming out of the various places of worship. Well, the police, in the execution of their duty, civilly requested a group, who were thus standing together in the High-street, to " move on," and they turned out to be a tradesman's family, who had since been to them complaining of the impertinence of the police in this respect. He had opportunities of being acquainted with the state of other military towns, and he could say with Mr. Pinnock, that Newport was not to be compared with any of them. Take Portsmouth, Winchester, Chatham, or even the fashionable town of Southampton, and immorality exhibited itself in a much greater degree in those towns than in Newport— (hear).

The Town Clerk (Mr. Eldridge) replied, that as far as the memorial which had been spoken of went, he believed he and the other parties connected with that movement had acted with perfect consistency, and had done nothing in it but what was proper. Their attention had been drawn to the retrograding state of the public morals of Newport, and they were anxious to use every exertion legally to stem the growing depravity of the town— which was patent to all. With respect to the tract in question, he had read it, and thought it a very injudicious publication, and feeling this, when their town missionary spoke to him respecting some which he had for circulation, he told him it would be unwise to do so, and that he had best not have anything to do with it. But, nevertheless, he thought the less said about the matter the better. He and Dr. Wavell had the weekly inspection of the Town Missionary's report book, and they unhappily knew that many moving in the higher ranks of life were guilty of fostering the immorality of the town by their own immoral conduct —(great excitement, and cries of "Order" from both sides of the Chamber).

The Chairman must call Mr. Eldridge to order. Such Observations were in very bad taste and most improper, and they could not be heard sitting there in judgment on their fellow-townsmen ; and he was surprised and vexed to learn that such a spy system had been adopted of diving into matters of privacy, for the purpose of getting up a Quixotic crusade against an evil whicb, by parties thus acting with such indiscreet religious zeal, would be the very means of increasing the evils they would wish to suppress. The utmost they could do was to put down dancing- houses and brothels, prevent broils and lewd and improper conduct in the streets, and keep public-houses as orderly as possible. Beyond this they could not go— (hear).

Mr. Pring to Mr. Eldridge— And by what means and authority do you and Dr. Wavell get the regular inspection of this Town Missionary's Report-book?

Mr. PiNNOCK— And if this is his mission, the sooner he is out of the town the better. Such a man is a curse to the town !

Mr. Eldridge— Not a curse. A blessing, I hope. His book is strictly private. No one but Dr. Wavell and myself, who sign it weekly, see the book.

Mr. Morris Morgan— It has been said that the Town Missionary had been told not to circulate the tract ; but he had reasons for believing that he did distributed them, and he had been informed that he had also given certain information to Carus Wilson on the subject— (exclamations of "Oh !")

Mr. Mew was astounded at what had been elicited during this discussion, and expressed himself in the most severe terms of disapprobation at the idea of some of the authorities of the town being so mixed up with such a disreputable matter— and they, too, professing themselves to be Christians ! Such conduct was scandalous and abominable, and was only second in infamy to the Paul Pry newspaper eapionage that was some yeara ago the medium of so much scandal and abuse, and had such a baneful effect on society. He thought if Mr. Eldridge felt rightly on the matter, he would at once cut the acquaintance of this Town Missionary, at least.

After some further stormy observations— many of the Council joining in the discussion—it was agreed that the Mayor should take what steps he might consider necessary as a still further disclaimer to the false and injurious reports which had been so industriously circulated concerning the reputation of their borough ; and the Council broke up with anything but delighted feelings.

Carus Wilson, in answer to one sent him by the Mayor of Newport, respecting the tract "the Tempters and Tempted," appeared in court. The defendant had been liberated on his own bail, and retained Mr. George Prince Joyce as his legal adviser. It was told on his appearing in the box that there war charge against then put several questions to the Bench, but was answered that his client was discharged. He applied for an order for the restitution of the pamphlets, and was referred to the inspector of Police.

COUNTY POLICE

Libel Case.— An extraordinary meeting of the County Magistrates was held on Monday, at the Guildhall, to hear the charge made by Mr. Francis Pittis, of Newport, against the Rey. W. Carus Wilson, for having written a false and scandalous libel on his character. The court-room and gallery were crowded with persons of interest of the Town, and other parts of the Island. The Bench consisted of the Hon. a'Court Holmes (chairman), Sir John Simeon, Bart., Capt. Kerr, Capt. Brigstocke, Thomas Cooke. and J. A. Hambrough, Esqrs.

Mr. Eldridge appeared for the prosecutor, and Mr. Ford for the defendant. The latter handed in a Medical Certificate that the health of the defendant would not allow of his appearing that day. The case proceeded without his presence. Mr. Eldridge observed that it had been said a good name was a man's best inheritance, it certainly was above all earthly treasure. He was bound to say, his client had the respect of all who knew him, and he must say that the high and honourable position which Mr. Pittis holds, as Alderman of the Borough, makes him careful of not allowing even shadows to be cast on his reputation. In a certain tract, imputations are thrown on his character, and although he feels free front all aapersions, he could not allow them to pass, whether intended or not, without a public denial of their application. He believed they were not intended, but that the defendant, with great zeal, had exceeded his duty ; for when a man steps out of his way, on the delicate ground of private character, he must treat the subject in a delicate manner, and not rush hastily to commit wrong; because he might think there was some good in the distance. No one who reads the tract and pamphlet, can doubt that they reflect seriously on the character of the town, and on individuals; it is not simply a degree of bitterness, but there are the most unwarranted innondoes. He did not stand as an apologist for vice; but it was a most unfortunate circumstance, that when a memorial had been presented to the magistrates which they admitted would check crime and immorality, that these works should have been brought out. He admitted there was much evil, and when he had the honour of filling the office of first magistrate, he, like those in office now, could only deal with cases brought before him. There were cases of gross immoral houses always complained of, by parties, who would never come forward to prove the cases within their own observation. Plain allusions had been made in the pamphlet to the Town Clerk,—he would say, that his observations in the council were misunderstood and misreported. He was sensible of the evils in the Town, and with others had endeavoured to diminish the amount. A certain journal came before him, but only shewing the operations of the society. It did not refer to any member in the council, or to any one in authority; it was merely a record of the poor persons who had been visited. An apology of an ample character having been given completely satisfactory, Mr. Pittis telt he had done his duty to himself, and wished to show he had no vindictive motives.

A letter was then brought forward and read.

Mr. Ford said he represented Mr. Wilson, and he regretted that of the observations made by Mr. Eldridge, would compel him to say more than he had intended, which was simply to offer the fullest apology and explanation to Mr. Pittis. Mr. Eldridge had shown that Mr. Wilson was fully justified in the course he had taken, by the admissions made by himself: on the part of Mr. Wilson he was instructed to say, that that gentleman had the fullest confidence in the integrity and strict morality of Mr. Pittis, and that the quotation from the letter of a friend at Bristol, although one or two circumstances appeared to correspond, had no reference to him, and he begged again to say that there was no imputation intended to be conveyed, and read the letter purporting to be one from Bristol.— Mr. Ford said that if there should be a republication, the passage affecting Mr. Pittis should be taken out.— Mr. Hearn attempted to express his dissent from the course adopted, but was stopped by Mr. Ford, who said that he and the bench had only to do with Mr. Pittis, it was quite irregular.—The chairman after a consultation, said, that as the case had been compromised, they were of opinion that Mr. Hearn should not be heard. Others were affected besides Mr. Pittis.— Mr. Hearn said that others were implicated in the charges, and the apology was made to them, he would not be precluded from taking proceedings in another place.— Mr. Eldridge observed that Mr. Pittis felt that after this ample apology, he should not be acting as a man or a Christian to press the case.— The chairman said that the course pursued was very creditable to both parties. Mr. Pittis very properly came forward to vindicate his character from the vile suspicion. With regard to the pamphlet, every one must see that it was intended for Mr. Pittis, but no one would believe it of him. He hoped Mr. Wilson's friends would advise him better than to re-issue the tracts. He could not perhaps control his zeal, but he hoped he would not use it in such an uncalled for way. He was sorry that Mr. Pittis should have had occasion to appear that day. Mr. Wilson said the quotation did not apply to Mr. Pittis, and they were bound to believe him.

Hampshire Advertiser - Saturday 01 March 1856

CHARGE AGAINST THE REV. WM. CARUS WILSON FOR DEFAMATION OF CHARACTER.

The town has been in a state of ferment for the last few days, in consequence of a second pamphlet published by this gentleman, in reply to a letter from the Mayor, J. H. Hearn, esq. on behalf of the town, condemnatory of his proceedings in reference to his first tract. There being certain portions in this last pamphlet which were considered libellous, and particularly in one apparently glaring instance, whereby the character of a principal tradesman of our town was believed to be maligned, placards wece issued cautioning persons against their circulation; and on Saturday James Lewis, alias " Nobby Dux," was taken to the Station-house, and bound over in his own recognisances for his appearance to answer the charge of publicly selling this obnoxious tract in the Beast Market on that day. On Monday he appeared before the Borough Magistrates, but was dismissed, as the charge of libel concerning Francis Pittis, esq. by the rev. defendant was just about being proceeded with.

The Town Hall was crowded to excess for some considerable time previously to the case coming on.

The Hon. A'Court Holmes occupied the chair, and on the Bench we observed Sir John Simeon, bart. Captains Brigstocke and Kerr, A. Hamborough, esq. and other gentlemen. The charge against the rev. gentleman was, "That he unlawfully and maliciously did publish a certain false and defamatory libel of and concerning Francis Pittis."

James Eldridge, esq. (brother-in-law of the plaintiff) attended for the prosecution ; and Henry Ford. Esq. (of the firm of Messrs. Ford, solicitor, of Portsea) appeared for the defendant.

The Rev. Carus Wilson was not present, and Mr. Ford put into Court a certificate of illness, stating he was confined to his room from indisposition.

J Eldridge, esq. opened the case by observing it had been well said that a man's good name was his wealth, and anything uttered derogatory to his fair fame was calculated to be injurious to him in many respects. Thus Mr. Francis Pittis, for whom he that day appeared, felt himself bound to vindicate his character against the aspersions which he considered had been made by the Rev. Wm. Carus Wilson respecting him, in a pamphlet he had lately addressed to the Mayor of Newport, and which had been the cause of the present legal proceedings. Mr. Pittis held a high and honourable position as an Alderman of their boroegh, and his standing in society was such that he was certain his fellow-townsmen would never attach to him the slightest imputation of the nature contained in that tract. Therefore, he could not but prosecute the present proceedings, which he felt was due to himself and to the town, however painful it was to his feelings to do so. He would not say that the rev. gentleman did, by the publication of that pamphlet, wittingly and maliciously asperse and defame the character of Mr. Pittis. althongh it was evident a certain paragraph in it did refer to him, and must have had that effect had not the present proceedings been instituted. He (Mr. Eldridge) believed that the defendant was a good man, and no doubt meant well ; but he had acted most indiscreetly. According to his own showing he was on delicate ground; and when a person stepped out of his way, even with the philanthropic object he professed to have in view, he should be careful how he rudely trod upon the fair fame of one whom he acknowledged not even to have known by name. A great deal had been said in the town about another tract- "Tempters and Tempted," out of which the present pamphlet had originated. Of the merits or demerits of this first tract he would say nothing, as the libel which Mr. Pittis complained of was contained in the latter ; and no one reading certain lines In the 13th page of the last pamphlet, and acquainted wiih his client, and events which had happened in their town within the laat three years, could have the slightest hesitation in saying that they referred to him and reflected upon his character. He (Mr. Eldridge) felt himself bound further to say, that besides the false and defamatory libel he bad referred to affecting the character of Mr. Pittis, the pamphlet was, in his opinion, not dictated by a Christian spirit; it was penned with a degree of bitterness and exaggeration, and contained unfounded imputations, inuendoes, and sweeping censures, injuriously affecting the character of the Magistrates of the borough, and the inhabitants of the town generally, and not at all creditable to the position of the defendant as a gentleman and a clergyman. Whilst he spoke thus stringently of his conduct, he would wish to be understood that he did not stand there as the apologist for vices which were, unfortunately, too common in their town, although he believed not more so than in other localities; neither did he uphold the evil doings of such men who were well described by the reverend gentlemen as " the mean and dastardly betrayers of female innocence." It was unfortunate for the case of Mr. Wilson, that his pamphlet did not appear until after the Magistrates had earnestly directed their attention to the moral state of the borough, in which they had been strengthened by an influential memorial which had been presented to them, and he (Mr. Eldridge) felt happy in stating that the authorities had not been slack in determinedly and impartially using their endeavours to put down vice and immorality in the town. It was due to them that he sbould thus publicly state this fact, and he considered it was right the rev. gentleman should know it. He (Mr. Eldridge) had filled the office of Chief Magistrate of their borough, and, consequently, knew from experience they could deal with open immorality only. He instanced a case which came under his own knowledge while presiding over them aa Mayor. He knew there waa a certain house of ill-fame, where the worst of vices were carried on ; he went to the neighbours, who were cognisant of the fact and the only parties who could testify to it ; but none could be induced to give the necessary testimony, in consequence of which his efforts to remove the evil were frustrated. He mentioned this circumstance to show the rev. gentleman and his informants how difficult it was to deal with such cases. Reference had been made to him in the pamphlet, as to what he, as their Town Clerk, had said at a late Town Council meeting, in a discussion on the defendant's first tract. He must be permitted to say that his observations on that occasion had been misrepresented in the town, and somewhat mis-reported, and from these circumstances certain parties in the Town Council had been pointed to as if his remarks had referred to them. He wished thus publicly to state, that while there were many things in the Town Missionary's journal, showing the immoralities which unhappily existed among those he was in the habit of visiting, there was no record impugning the characters of those not under actual visitation. What he then was about to state was, that " unhappily some painful circumstances had occurred amongst persons of a higher class"— At this point of his observations the Mayor stopped him, and nothing further was said by him. He (Mr. Eldridge) would most distinctly state that he did not refer to any one in the Town Council, or to any other person in authority, but to one or two cases which were well-known to the town. In conclusion, he would state that Mr. Pittis was wholly and entirely innocent of the charge alleged against him in the pamphlet. He would not, however, proceed further at present, as he understood that Mr. Ford, on the part of the defendant, was ready to offer an explanation and apology ; and hs should, therefore, pause to hear if it were of such a full and ample character as he conld advise Mr. Pittis to accept.

Mr. H. Ford rose to reply. He regretted Mr. Pittis had been so hastily led to the conclusion that the pamphlet, in reply to the Mayor's letter to his client respecting a former tract, contained libellous and defamatory remarks respecting him. What the rev. gentleman had done in these pamphlets was to write against the vice and immorality wbich existed generally in Newport : and Mr. Eldridge, in opening the case, had admitted that fact, by stating that a deputation bad appealed to the magistratea as to the existing bad state of the borough in this respect. With regard to the imputation which was said to apply to Mr. Pittis, his own character and standing in the town should have eased his conscience or any anxiety he is said to have felt in the matter ; and he (Mr. Ford) could not but think that he had unhappily been induced to take these proceedings against his client, through the persuasions of others, that the objectionable sentence upon which this inquiry had been raised referred to him. He was pleased, however, to be able to prove most conclusively that when Mr. Wilson penned these words, the notion never for one moment entered his mind that they would in any way apply to him, having never heard aught of that gentleman beyond his bearing a character for the strictest integrity and the greatest morality. His client had certainly discovered, since the publication of that pamphlet, that there were one or two circumstances bearing on a former official position of Mr. Pittis in their town, which did seem to give a colouring to the assertion complained of as applying to him ; but be would most emphatically assure them, that from an investigation he had made, he was enabled to state that the Rev. Mr. Wilson never received the least intimation from any individual detrimental to that gentleman'a character; and to show the Bench that his client waa desirous of removing this false impression as soon as he knew of its existence, he (defendant) wrote the following letter to Mr. Pittis, which he would read to the Court :—

" Boniface-house, 23rd February, 1856.  
"Dear Sir,— Your letter to Mr. Gastar has been read to me in bed, from which serious illness prevents my rising.

" I cannot delay a moment in relieving the wounded feelings whicb must necessarily have been created if you supposed that I intended to make the slightest reference, directly or indirectly, in any part, either of the tract or letter, to yourself, or any other magistrate of the town of Newport.

"The passage you refer to was entirely taken from a letter sent to me from Bristol, from a party wholly unacquainted with Newport, as a comment upon my endeavours to show where the root of the evil too often lies, and was wholly of a general character, and irrespective of any particular locality.

"I particularly regret that any one should have supposed the passage to refer to yourself, as I had always heard and thought of you with the greatest respect.

" I am, sir, your's faithfully,

" F. Pittis. Esq." " Wm. Carus Wilson.

In order further to satisfy Mr. Pittis, he (Mr. Ford) had shown him the original letter which his client had received from Bristol. He trusted that this public avowal on behalf of his client would be sufficient to meet the circumstances of the case; and he would give his pledge that whatever farther use might be made of the pamphlet in question it should be suppressed in its present form, and he would remove the three or four lines from it which had been considered offensive. Mr. Pittis at the same time would be at liberty to make whatever use he pleased of the correspondence he had in his possession on the subject, and he trusted that the explanation which had been given, and the apology he had made on the part of his client, would be sufficient to satisfy Mr. Pittis and the town generally.

J. S. Hearne, eqs. here rose and said, that as the Mayor of Newport he could not in duty to the town, could not allow the present opportunity top ass without—

Mr. Ford, who insisted that such a procedure on the part of Mr. Hearn was most improper, and no one knew better than he did that it was out of all order.

The Mayor, however, persisted, amidst the suppressed applause of the court. The bench had power to decide, and he therefore appealed to the honourable chairman.

After a minate's consultation, ths Bench observed, as they believed the apology which had been made on the part of the defendant would most probably be accepted, they did not consider that as the town of Newport generally had been referred to in the case, Mr. Hearn, as its chief magistrate, should be debarred from making some observation with reference thereto.

Mr. Ford responded, that he trusted Mr. Hearn would be guarded in his remarks, and not make any charge affecting his client.

Mr. Hearn observed, all he rose to say was— that the apology offered Mr. Pittis, on the part of the defendant, should by no means preclude him from preferring a charge against him in another place on behalf of the borough, should he be so advissd (a burst of applanse here ran through the court).

Mr. Eldridge then rose, and said be was instructed by Mr. Pittis to state that he had accepted the apology of Mr. Ford on the part of the rev. defendant, and he felt he would not be acting the part of a Christian if he had refused to do so. With respect to the steps he had taken, he did not see how be could have acted otherwise. Let them look at the circumstances of the case. In 1854, Mr. Pittis, as their chief magistrate, attended the laying of the foundation stone of their new church, on which occasion they were honoured with the presence of the consort of her Gracious Majesty, the Prince Albert. He (Mr. P.) afterwards presided at a dinner at the Town Hall—there toasted the health of the Bishop of Wincfaester—and spoke of the cburch of his forefathers. Now let them compare these circumstances with the following extract from defendant's pamphlet :-" Of the magistrate who presides at a dinner toasting a Bishop after the consecration of a churcb, and spouting about the churcb of our forefathers." [Mr. Eldridge did not finish the sentence, whicb contains the libel-" while known to be a frequenter of the brothel."] And then let any person say whether or not they would not have taken these remarks as reflecting upon Mr. Pittis as their then Mayor, and referring to no other person. He did trust that in future Mr. Wilson would be really cautious in publishing and putting into circulation stories affecting the characters of individuals, obtained from the loose assertions of others— and of which he admitted he had no personal knowledge whatever. Such conduct he could not but say was most derogatory to the Christian Character

At the conclusion of Mr. Eldridge'a observations, the crowded court signified their approbation by several outbursts of applause. The Hon Chairman observed, that the course which Mr. Pittis had pursued on the matter was in every respect a very proper one, and his acceptation of the explanation and apology which had been given in behalf of the defendant was most honourable to him. The steps he had taken were only such as were necessary to vindicate his character from the imputations which certainly did previously appear to the Bench to have been levelled at him ; although he would not for one moment believe the censure implied in the pamphlet as referring to him found a single response in the public mind. It would be superfluous on the part of the Bench to state that the well known moral character of Mr. Pittis —his standing in society, and the high estimation in which he was held by all who knew him, raised him above any foul aspersions which might be uttered regarding him ; and as they had heard what defendant by his counsel had said respecting the offensive paragraph in the pamphlet, and that he most distinctly asserted he did not in any way allude to him, he (the Chairman) considered it was unnecessary to make any further remarks about it. But he could not refrain from saying, that he considered such tracts as those the rev. gentleman had thought proper to publish and put in circulation, affecting the town of Newport, were quite uncalled for and most injudicious, and not at all reputable on the part of the defendant ; and he did trust he would altogether withdraw them, and be better advised in future.

After expressions of approbation on the part of the assembly, the Court broke up.

Mr. Thomas Butler, printer, of Ryde, and Mr. Henry Medley, of Ventnor (the printer of the last pamphlet), were also indicted, but they were not called upon.

Portsmouth Times and Naval Gazette - Saturday 26 January 1856

OPENING OF A SOLDIERS’ INSTITUTE AT PORTSMOUTH.

On Wednesday evening a meeting was held on the opening of the Soldiers’ Institution, which has been established in King-street, Portsmouth, to afford the soldiers quartered this garrison a library, reading-room, and other conveniences, in which they can employ their time in reading, or other rational amusementa during their leisure hours.

The Institution has been established mainly through the instrumentality the Rev. W. Carus Wilson, who first brought the subject forward, and who haa been nobly seconded by the officers in the garrison.

Above 100 soldiers, principally of the Artillery, were present at the meeting, nearly fifty whom gave in their names members of the Institution, at the close of the meeting.

Captain Tate occupied the chair, and was supported the Rev. Mr. Childs, Rev. W.C. Wilson, Capt. Campbell, Capt. Savage, G. Rylands, Esq., C. Bintead, Esq. Revs. J. Knapp, J. Power, Capt. Hawke, and others, would have been there, had not circumstances prevented them.

The Chairman, in opening the proceedings, said that for the formation of the Institution they were greatly indebted to the philanthropic spirit of the Rev. W. C. Wilson, through whose exertions it had been brought forward. In the Institution the soldier would find every comfort—newspapers, library, coffee rooms, and every means of rational instruction and amusement, which he hoped would keep many from the haunts which abounded in the town, and lead them to understand that a vicious course of life was incompatible with true bappiness. (Cheers.)

Rev. Mr. Childs said he would endeavour to place before the meeting the object they had in view in formiog the institute. He formerly lived in a garrison town ( Devonport) for some time, and well knew what inducements were held out to young men in such towns to lead them into wrong paths, and the necessity there existed for the formation of some counteracting influence. The rev. gentlemen then pointed out to the meeting the hideousness of vice, by relating an incident which occurred during his residence Devonport. It was at the death-bed of a woman, who some years previously had been instrumental in causing a marine—her companion in vice—to be transported for a felony, which she, herself, had committed. He described the fearful effects produced by conscience in her last moments, and continued: Their object in forming the institution was to provide them with a "Clubhouse," as it might called, where, when they left their barracks, they might have a lounge, read the papers, and perhaps meet a friend—where they might smoke their pipe, spin a yarn, and fight their battles over again. (Cheers.) If they did not like smoking, there was another room where they could have a quiet cup of coffee, and a comfortable chat with a companion. The room they were now in was the general room, where they would have placed upon a table all the news of the day, by which they might watch their companions in arms fighting for their country in other lands. (Cheers.) They would also have library and class rooms, where he hoped they would get mutual instruction amongst themselves. They did not want see them crammed with lectures, but see them gathering honey for themselves. That was a great fault in Mechanics’ Institutes; they gave information, without teaching men to exert themselves; it was if they crammed the stomach without causing them to earn their bread by the sweat of the brow. If they did the latter, they were better in physical health, and if they strove to learn themselves they would be better in mental health. (Hear, hear.) They wanted to see them form classes amongst themselves, in which those who were well instructed might help the others. It was also desired that they should have the management of the institution in their own hands ; that a committee of management should be formed out of the members. As there was a United Service Club, so they wished to form a kind of club for the troops in garrison, and upon its auspicious opening he begged to congratulate them. (Applause.)

Rev W. Carus Wilson, who in rising was received with much applause, said that whatever they did in the way of contributing to the comfort and happiness of the soldier, was only the payment of a moiety of the debt of gratitude which they owed the brave defenders of our country, and which had been much increased during these critical time. He had long seen the necessity of the formation of such institutions and he must say that, although he had taken part in various undertakings, none had given him greater pleasure and satisfaction than the little efforts which he had been able to put forth on behalf of the soldier. He had been much abroad of late years, and had caused many thousand Bibles to circulated in Italy, especially amongst Sardinian soldiers. He should not enlarge upon this subject, as he had promissed to attend a meeting of the Soldiers’ Friend Society the followmg Wednesday evening, when he hoped to give much interesting information respecting his labours in that field; he woould therefore simply state that the work had been eminently successful ; both officers aod soldiers had taken an interest in it and that at the camp at Boulogne, as well as in Italy, many thousands of Bibles, besides innumerable tracts, had been circulated amongst the soldiery. After speaking of the assistance he had received in the latter piece from the Rev. Mr Brown, the reverend gentleman said that it was a great delight to his mind to meet them that evening, but it was not necessary for him dwell on the advantages of the inslitution, as that had been so ably done by Mr. Childs, but he would remark that there were many collateral as well as direct advantages attendant upon it. He was glad to see the assimilation of ranks which it produced—that whilst the officer had his club-house, the soldier should have the same, for there was something exceedingly imteresting in the fact that men of all ranks and classes were likely to be provided for. He hoped, however, they were as but the commencement of the work, for it was his longing desire to see the "The Soldier's Institute " made as perfect as possible, not only because this was the largest garrison town in the kingdom, but as as encouragement to other places to follow their example. (Cheers.) Some friends at Dover had already made application to him to assist in forming one for the barracks at that town, and he was sure he should find willing helpers there. (Hear, hear.) It would be gratifying to them to know that the proceedings were receiving countenance, not only from the officers of the army universally, but from higher quarters.— Lord Panmure having expressed himself favourable to them. (Applause.) The rev. gentleman then read a letter which had been addressed to Lord Panmure by a military chaplain; it spoke of the temptations to which the soldier was subjected, and remarked that although they could not expect to remove these altogether, it was their duty to do what they could to counteract their influence, and recommended the adoption of a plan similar to that carried out in the formation of the Portsmouth Soldiers' Institute; he said that the ordinary library in the barrack was not sufficiently attractive; something on the principle of a *café* being the *desideratum*. This, continued the speaker, had met with the full approval of Lord Panmure, and whilst considering that they had commenced under very favourable auspices, he hoped to see the day when no garrison town in England would be destitute of such an institution. There was one point he would wish to refer to with to with repsect to the collateral advantages of the institution. He thought it best to have it distinct from the barracks, as it would be a greater change for the soldiers, and it would enable them to fraternise with soldiers of other regiments; it would would bring them out from the contracted limit of their own little circle, so that they might compare notes with one another. He thought this an important feature in the institution. (Cheers.) He perfectly agreed in the sentiments of the chaplain in the letter he had read—"No acts of Parliament, no efforts of their own, would keep men from evil, or lead them to good;" but although that was certain, they should do what they could. Men’s minds were always seeking after happiness and enjoyment, and they should give such a spirit every encouragement in a rational way. In the institution they were now such would be found, and they could enjoy their pipe and tobacco at their ease. With regard to smoking, that had been a debated point, but it was ultimately decided that such should be allowed to all who wished to pursue it. In the library they would find books of all kinds, but although they were not all religious books, he would not disguise from them that the great object they had in view was to make them true soldiers of the Cross, for there could be no true happiness without holiness. Many other things would be given them, and they might rest assured that if they found the premises too straight for them, they should be widened—(cheers)—for they would not rest content without endeavouring to promote their happiness, and he would conclude with expressing the earnest hope that God's blessing would rest upon them and their undertaking.

Captain Savage being compelled to take his departure, the Cbaibiiaf said, that previous to his doing so, ho was sure they would all join in giving to him their hearty thanks for the part ho had taken in the undertaking. (Loud applause.) Had it not been for the hearty 00-operation of Capt. Savage and other officers, all the efforts of Rev. Mr. Wilson would bare been unavailing. The proposition was carried with acclamation. Captain Campbell would only say a few words, as so much had been said the objects of the institution previous speakers. Thirty years ago, when in India, be could net help noticing the demoralising character of the army, and he therefore congratulated them that they lived in different times. He hoped they would appreciate the benefits of tbo institution, and that the present building would be found too ■mall for them, when they would find bettor accommodation for them in another place. (Cheers.) would always happy to contribute his mite, and would conclude by wishing prosperity to the undertaking. (Loud applause.) Rev. W. C. Wilson said there was one little fact which ho would like mention. friend of his, the late Colonel Hewlett, who fell at the attack the Bedan, stated te him some time ago, that whereas out of his regiment of men, there were formerly 30 morning who were brought before him in consequence of having got, into scrape,” since they bad formed institution with library, &c., for the use of the regiment, they had dwindled down six eight. (Applause.) He hoped none in that room would got into such awkward predicaments. Rev. W. C. Wilson, again rising, said be would remark that if any of the members wished to have any alteration or improvement made, their suggestions would receive the utmost attention. Bev. Mr. Childs said that it was desired that a practical committee should bo formed out of their own body, would recommend them to consult together to recommend one from each company or corps, in whom they had confidence, on that committee. Rev. W. C. Wilson read a most beautiful and affecting letter which he had received from soldier at Malta; every word in it breathe a spirit of religious principle, which it was truly delightful to listen to. Rev. W. Livinostohe, after remarking on the practice now observed by the greater portion of the clergy of this country, of offering up prayers for the safety of our soldiers during the war, which he stated originated with the Rev. Mr. Wilson, said that the institution had been established to draw the soldiers from the sources of temptation to which was subjected to enable him meet in place where might enjoy himself without danger his morals, with friends belonging to other regiments, so promote that spirit of brotherhood which it was so cheering to heboid. remembered not long ago, reading a work in which the writer said the glory of England’s greatness had departed, that in the event another she would have no men who could maintain her honour, but he thought that when 8,000 Englishmen kept 25,000 Russians bay for several hours, there was the same enthusiasm * the same unswerving indomitable bravery in them that there ever was (cheers); indeed, he believed more bravery had been shown in the Crimea than at any time in the Peninsula. (Loud applause.) But whilst they bad shown such bravery in an earthly fight, there was a spiritual conflict with the powers darkness, which with God's grace, they should carry on strongly and heroically, and ho hoped that tbo establishment of tlus institution would enable them carry on that fight with success, and prayed that as they bad met together that evening, they would meet together before the throne grace. G. Esq., as one of the Committee, said that other classes of the community had institutions and associations in which they met together for mutual improvement; and so when Mr. Wilson proposed the establishment of soldier’s institute, they thought it but right that the soldier should possess the same advantages. (Cheers.) hoped they would distinctly understand that their wish was that the institution should be under the control the members themselves; and they hoped that if there was any paper placed upon the table which a majority of them did not approve of any other which they would like have, they would inform them it, and their wishes would be complied with. The time which the institution should bo opened would also be left for them decide upon. Every suggestion they might make, which would add their comfort or convenience, would be attended to, as Committee wished to make a model institution from which other towns might take a copy. (Hear, bear.) As had been remarked by former speakers, they would find the table in the room in which they were sitting covered with magazines; the library filled with useful and entertaining books; class rooms, and lecture rooms; they might also, if they preferred it, have some one read to them. Every thing that was possible be sccomplisbod would be done to afford them instruction; and ho hoped that not only every one present would join, but that each would induce a comrade go with him. (Applause.) Rev. C. Wilsox, alter stating that the rules of the institution admitted all soldiers the garrison its benefits on payment of a Id. per week, said that coffee also would furnished the lowest possible price. Ho had determined be the first taste tbo coffee made in the institution, and he must any that never tasted any better in England. (Applause.) The committee had also decided on opening the institution on the Sunday, not for reading the newspapers, or anything secular character, but for admittance to the religious works in library, A«. (Applause.) To make the work quite complete, the institution would be furnished with materials for amusement (but not for gambling) in the shape of draught and chess boards and men, backgammon, and a bagatelle board (cheers); these would be supplied with the understanding that, directly or indirectly, no gambling would be allowed. one set of any of these was not found be sufficient, was sure tho Committee would gladly furnish more. (Applause.) . « . »r vote of thanks was then given the Secretary, Mr. Batchelor, and tho Chairman; and G. Kylands, Esq., having stated that a gentleman (Mr. D. Barker), agent of Soldiers’ Friend Society, had come down from W inch ester n,\ attended the meeting obtain some information preparatory to forming similar institution in that town, The meeting separated, about fifty, we before stated, giving in their names as members.

SOLDIERS' INSTITUTES.—

On the 23rd January last, the Soldiers' Institute at Portsmouth was opened. It was described in the prospectus, a copy of which has been forwarded to us by a gentleman who takes much interest in the soldiers' welfare, the Rev. W. Carus Wilson:—

"The Soldiers' Institute comprises a reading-room, supplied with daily and weekly newspapers, and most of the  leading and useful periodicals and current literature of the day. Joined to this, a library for the exclusive use of the members, embracing works in every department in literature, as well as others that may prove useful in their profession. Class-rooms for mutual improvement, and occasional lectures, add another feature to the general object. United with the above are two coffee-rooms, which it is hoped will contribute to the comfort of the members, and tend to lessen the frequenting of public-houses. The subscription is fixed at one penny per week, for which a cheque is given, the possession of which entitles the holder to all the advantages of the institute, for so long a period as it is dated for." 

It will thus be seen that the Soldiers' Institute is analagous to the Mechanics' Institute, and is calculated to effect much good by furnishing useful employment and the nmeans of innocent recreation during leisure hours. We heartily wish success to the Portsmouth Institute, and should be glad to see a similar plan adopted in other towns. The country would thus in some measura repay that debt which she owes to our brave soldiers.

NEWPORT. COUNTY PETTY SESSIONS.

BOROUGH PETTY SESSIONS. MONDAY, JULY 11th, (Before R. M. Wavell, and E. Way, Esqrs.)

Timothy Mahony was brought up under remand, charged with administering some deleterious drug to Elizabeth Hurst, Edith Parsons, and Elizabeth Jackman, prostitutes, at the "Old King's Arms." From the evidence of the girls, and of Susan Munday, a witness, it appeared that on the previous Tuesday evening the prisoner and a sailor went into the house where they found the complainants—that four quarts of beer were had in and paid for by the sailor—that the prisoner was seen to put some powder into the cup—to pour it into the glass and to return it to the cup. The girls were taken ill with similar symptoms within half-an-hour, and Robert Henkel, Esq., Surgeon, who was called, deposed that beer could not have the effects which he observed, and he had no doubt the symptoms were caused by some drug mixed in the ale.—Mr. G. P. Joyce appeared for the prisoner, and pressed for an adjournment, or justice would be denied to his client, as the assizes were then commenced, and there was not time to get up a defence.—COmmitted for trial at the assizes. The bill was ignoted by the Grand Jury as far as poisoning was concerned, and one found for an assault, which Sergeant Chenneil, who tried the prisoner, ruled was untenable,—he was therefore discharged.

BOROUGH POLICE COURT, TUESDAY, JULY (Before the Mayor and R. M. Wavell, Esq.)

Caroline Pierce and Caroline Sibley, two prostitutes, were charged by Lieut. Davey, of the 1st Royals, with stealing a carbuncle gold pin from his person, on Mondey night, at the Rose and Crown. It appeared that the prisoners and prosecutor were in company, and one, if not both girls, sat on his knees. He missed the pin soon after, but did not see either of them take it, and it was not found.—The case was dismissed.
