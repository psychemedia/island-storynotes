BOROUGH SESSIONS. Mayor F. Pittis, esq. (mayor), and Edw. Way, esq.

Joseph Anderson, of the Crab and Lobster publichouse, was charged with keeping his house open for the sale of beer after 10 o'clock on Sunday night, the 21th ult.

P.C. Lockhart said— I went to the defendant's house in company with P.C. Cave at twenty minutes to 11 on the night in question and heard persons in the house. I stopped at the front door and Cave went to the back door. Cave knocked at the back door and some oue asked who it was, and he said, the police. The person did not open the door but went back again into the house. I heard a scuffle in the house afterwards. I rapped several times at the front door, and I heard the defendant say to a boy inside, Why don't you open the door or go and see who it is. A female made replv and said, you know who it is, it is the police. The defendant then came to the door and asked who it was. I told him, the police. He opened the door, and I asked him who he had in his house. He said, no one. I told him he had for I heard them. He again said he had no one; he would not do anything against the law if he knew it, for ever so. I went to the back door and let Cave in. We searched the house and found two men in a cupboard in the back room, two in the coal hole and in the yard, one the water closet. There were cups the sideboard that had been used for beer, and there was a quart cup and a glass half-full of beer in the other room. I told him I must report him. He said he hoped I should not.

In defence, Anderson Baid no beer had been drawn since ten minutes before 10 o'clock; but, of course, such an excuse would not satisfy the magistrates, and they fined him 20s. and 5s. costs.

BOROUGH SESSIONS.

Monday.— Before C. W. Estcourt, Esq., mayor; and E. Way, Esq.

Joseph Anderson, of the " Crab and Lobster" beer shop, was charged with keeping his house open for the sale of beer after the time allowed by law, and secreting soldiers at such times.

P.C. Cave, said — I went to defendant's house about half-past 11 o'clock on Monday night, the 19th of February, with the picket, in search of absent soldiers. I was admitted, and defendant's wife said no soldiers were there. Defendant was present. I went to the coal hole door and found it tied inside. I broke the string, and found a soldier concealed in the corner of the coal hole. I asked defendant and his wife if they had any more in the house, and they said, no. I then went up stairs and found two girls sitting by the fire, and two soldiers lying under the bed.

P.C. Hobbs, said—I went to the defendant's house with the picket, on the night of the 19th of February, at about half-past 10 o'clock, and found three soldiers in the kitchen. The picket took them away, and when they got to Nodchill they escaped from the picket. I went back to the house about half-past 11 o'clock with the last witness. P.C. Cave asked if there were absent soldiers there, and Mrs. Anderson denied that there were. We found one soldier tied in the coal hole, and two up stairs. They were the same three soldiers who had been taken from the house. On Sunday last, about 12 o'clock at night, I went to defendant's house, and saw a soldier in the kitchen. I asked the defendant's wife if there were any more. She said, no. I then went up stairs and found soldier bed with a common prostitute. There were two other prostitutes on the second floor, and two men with them. I believe one of the women was a lodger, but not the other women nor the men. I then came down stairs, and Mrs. Anderson let another soldier out of the back door. There are great complaints of the house from the neighbours.

The defendant was fined £2, and 5s. costs, and in default of paymeut committed to the house of correction for a month.

BOROUGH COURT

BOROUGH COURT. Monday.— Magistrates present : The Mayor (C. W. Estcourt), and R. M. Wavell. esqrs.

 "Othello's Occupation Gone."— Joseph Anderson, the notorious occupier of the Crab and Lobster beer-shop (who is just out of Winchester Gaol), was again summoned, for " not being able to keep magistrates' hours," as he terms it.
 
Police-constable Hobbs stated that last Sunday week he went to the house of the defendant, at three o'clock in the afternoon, and found the front door open. There were between forty and fifty soldiers in the house, and some prostitutes; they were sitting about drinking beer. He went there with a piquet the other night, and they found six girls in bed.

Police constable Stubbs deposed that last Tuesday night, at half-past eleven, he caught about eight couple of men and women there. There were beer-cups on the table, and they were sitting down, listening to defendant singing, "John Anderson my Joe John." Stubbs remonstrated with him, and he merely remarked, that would make another charge against him.

Police-constable Cave proved the service of the summons. The man was not there, and his wife would not take it. She said her husband should not appear. He read the summons over, and put it down in the passage ; he then left. She ran after him, and told him he might light his pipe with it, &c., throwing the summons after him.

Mr. Inspector Grapes recited several cases of previous conviction. He was called in Court, but no one answered, and the Mayor then adjudged the defendant to be fined £20, the licrnse of the house to be cancelled, and himself to be disqualified for selling beer for two years. In default of payment of the fine, to be committed to Winchester Gaol for two months.

Petty Sessions

Saturday.—Before Sir H. P. Gordon, Bart., Chairman ; Sir John Simeon, Bart.; Capt. Hamond, R.N.; Capt. Crozier, R.N.; and Thomas Cooke, Esq.

Mr. Daucey, on being sworn, said —the prisoner was my servant and had access to my room and the charge of everything therein. On the 7th of May he left me, and after he had gone I looked over my things to see if anything had been taken, and I then missed the articles now named in the charge. They had all been taken from my drawer or from the mantle-piece. The drawer was not kept locked. I did not see any of the articles after I had missed them, until yesterday morning, when they were shown to me by the Sergeant of Police. The prisoner was absent from the barracks from Monday morning until the next Sunday morning, when he was brought in as a deserter. I can swear that the things now produced are those I lost.

Thomas Green, jun., chimney sweep at Newport, deposed to buying the coat of the prisoner for 2s. 6d. and an old coat.

Anne Jones, a common prostitute, living in Paradise-row, Newport, deposed to having received the ring from the prisoner and afterwards leaving it in the care of her landlady, Mrs. Leonard, who gave it up to the Police.

Elizabeth Pragnell, of the Oyster-shell houses, near Newport, said the prisoner came to her house in private clothes, with a girl, and asked to be allowed to stop there the night, which he did, and that he represented himself to belong to some ship about to be paid off at Portsmouth, and left with her the gold pin and studs for 15s., saying that he would take them again of her when he received his money.

P.S. Stannard then deposed to receiving the articles which he now produced of the several witnesses, and to taking the prisoner into custody. Committed to the sessions.

Isle of Wight Observer - Saturday 06 October 1855

During the last week a deputation, consisting of the clergymen of St. Thomas' Church, the ministers of the different dissenting congregations and others, presented the following memorial to the magistrates at the Townhall respecting the social condition of the borough, in the hope that means may be taken to prevent a continuation the present exhibition of indecency and open prostitution which now disgrace its thoroughfares :—

"To the worshipful the Mayor and the Magistrates of the borough of Newport, Isle of Wight.

"The memorial of the undersigned inhabitants of the said borough.

"Your memorialists beg respectfully to state that for some time they have, with many respectable inhabitants, had their attention turned to the moral aspect the borough of Newport.

"A few of the more serious part of the community are laboring, by appliances of a simple, but they trust efficient character, to rectify existing evils; but they fear that, without the cooperation which the municipal authorities can afford, their effort, however well intended, and however admirably conducted, will meet with counteractions too powerful, humanly speaking, for them to surmount.

"Without wishing to cast any reflection upon the municipal authorities, your memorialists request permission to suggest, whether the leading thoroughfares of the borough might not be kept more free from interruption, occasioned by individuals collecting in groups, and frequently conducting themselves in a manner most offensive to virtue — whether the By-Law No. 25 ['Every common prostitute, or night walker, who shall loiter or in any thoroughfare or public place for the purpose of prostitution or solicitation, shall for such offence forfeit and pay the sum of ten shillings'] could not be put in force, so that by its rigorous execution obstructions to a course of immorality might lawfully created — whether a stricter supervision could not be exercised over lodginghouses, lest they become the resort of characters for whose use they were not intended, and over public houses and beershops, multiplied, your memorialists fear, far beyond the wants of the borough, and where attractions are held out to make them the rendezvous of persons whose antecedents create a suspicion that they will prove nurseries of vice.

"In imploring the magistrates to exercise their authority for the prevention of crime as far as they can, your memorialists wish to be distinctly understood that they are not seeking any class legislation; their object being the purification of the borough from the social evils which unhappily abound within it, and it is their wish to see every offender, whatever be his grade in life, made amenable for his conduct. Any partial application of the law they would deprecate, for intelligent observers of passing events must see that ail efforts to cleanse the fountains of social life are invariably unpopular and fail, unless even-handed justice be administered all transgressors.

"In conclusion, your memorialists would observe that they address you, not as the organ of any political party, or of any religious denomination, but as inhabitants of the borough, deeply concerned for its highest welfare. Upon your aid they rely as invaluable auxiliary to the various benevolent agencies which are now operating for its social and moral improvement. Their aims, they are free to confess, partake of high and sacred character. On an arm more powerful than that which is human, and on means more effective than any legislation can afford, they depend for their ultimate attainment; but as the work is great, and hindrances from various causes multiply, they desire every kind legitimate of cooperation, and that which an intelligent and a vigilent magistracy can afford they appreciate too highly not to seek, and which, from the known character of the gentlemen who sit upon the beach, they feel pursuaded they shall not seek in vain.

"And your memorialists respectfully subscribe their names hereto."

Dr. Wavell, on the part of the magistrates, replied that the bench would do everything in their power to remedy the evils complained of.

Newport, Saturday, October 6.

The Retrograding State of Morals in Newport.

We omitted last week the following memorial, lately presented by the Rev. G H. Connor and other gentlemen to the Magistrates of the borough on this momentous and anxious subject. We have been so earnestly solicited to print the document that we give it insertion against our own inclinations, being unwilling to believe that there exists in the Isle of Wight a place so lost to Christianity, and so devoted to crime, beyond the crying evils of any other place in the kingdom. We are unwilling to believe it. If true, it does not say much in regard to precept and example. The Question arises— how is it that such a social ulceration has been left to fester amidst the general moral healthiness of the island !— to such an extent, too, as thus to meet the severe condemnation of the immediate residents, who *taboo* the town, and will prevent strangers approaching its scenes of vice. Our correspondent says—" We trust all those of the town who have thought seriously of the matter will exert them-selves in every way to *stem the torrent of juvenile profligacy and prostitution*, the streams of which literally choke up our priucipal thoroughfares of an evening:" This is a horrible picture, and is more out-spoken than the memorial.

[The memorial is then printed in full.]

The worshipful the mayor Dr. Wavell, and others of the authorities present, thanked the memorialists for their judicious suggestive hints, and were pleased in feeling that they had the willing co-operation of the respectable inhabitants of the borough.

Isle of Wight Mercury - Saturday 09 February 1856

The Mayor rose, and said, that he should not be doing justice to his own feelings or to the town if he did not bring before the Council the grows insult which had been cast on them by the address, the Tempter and Tempted, written, it was said, by a gentleman lately come to reside there, the Rev. Carus Wilson, and it was with no ordinary feelings of indignation that he found the beastly tract had been taken to his house, and was in the hands of his family and female domestics; could any honest man, could any father of a family avoid feeling grieved that such gross accounts of vice should be brought to defile the minds of young persons? He was more astonished and indignant to find that copies had been delivered to the children at the Sunday schools, and the National schools. He hoped the British schools had escaped the pollution. He considered these females who distributed such a work and placed them in the hands of children a disgrace to their sex. He regretted that these meddling troublesome fellows who were interfering where they had no connection with the towu, and he should have thought that Mr. Smith might have found other ditties for which he was paid by the Treasury, rather than interfering with the town of Newport. He felt it his duty to deny most clearly, and to protest most strongly against the falsehoods and calumnies which had been circulated respecting the Borough of Newport. He asserted firmly, and would prove his assertion that there were few more moral towns than Newport and no garrison town where there was so little debauchment. He could prove by official returns which he had obtained, that the health of the soldiers their general morality, while at Parkhurst, were much above the average. He could not have allowed the Council to have separated without throwing off the foul imputation, and pressing from his heart the indignation he felt at the insult that had been put on them, and the town.—Mr. W. B. Mew concurred io the sentiments and feelings expressed by the Mayor, and denounced the exaggerated statements about the town, which haul been put forth.—Mr. Robert Pinnock congratulated the Council on the course taken by the Mayor, to revel the calumnies which had been indulged in thousands of the books, had been circulated, and unless contradicted, migbt cling to the town. He asked the Mayor whether he would take it up as the organ of the Council, & repudiate the calumnioues attack on the town. Its origin could be traced to a new movement that had been organized in the memorial addressed to the Magistrates, and to a newspaper paragraph. He considered that the sooner such proceedings were discouraged the better.—Mr. Pring said the memorial had been handed to the Watch Committee, of which he was one, and after the strictest investigation, they came to an unanimous vote, that there was no cause to interfere with tie general arrangements. He had lately been in most of the towns in the kingdom where the military were near, and he said with confidence, that Newport for order, quietness and morality, surpassed all the others. Some persons were over nice, and he thought the Town Clerk might as will stay at home, as to go about interfering with others.—Mr. Eldridge (Town Clerk), said he was one of those who agreed with the memorial; he thought it was quite right, and no censure ought to be cast on those who were parties to it. The attention of the Magistrates was called to facts which were patent to all Gentlemen, and if those present had seen the report of the Town Missionary, which Dr. Wavell and himself had presented to them weekly, they would know the amount of vice which prevailed.—The Mayor said they had no right to sit in judgment upon others, they had no authority to judge and collect accusations against their neighbours. If this was the occupation of a Town Missionary, the sooner he was removed the better.—Mr. Eldridge said he knew that he had lifted up many who had been cast down, and he could tell of those in higher places, whose conduct would not bear investigation.—Mr. Pinnock said that the missionary was engaged to raise up the frail, but the course pursued by him and his employers, had turned out a curse to the town.—Mr. Wilkins and Mr. Morgan expressed similar feelings with the other members of the Council.—Mr. W. B. Mew wished to know by what authority these men had set up this court of inquisition; he felt indignant at their presumption. There was a newspaper once circulated in the town, called Paul Pry, which was very objectionable, and caused unpleasantness in many families but this was much worse, as the scandal was handed from one to the other, without the knowledge of the person whose reputation was attacked. If this Paul Pry defended by Mr. Eldridge, went into these abodes of sin and temptation, he ought to be exceedingly good; as pitch could not be handled without defilement. The exposure that day should induce the Town Clerk to cut such acquaintance, and he could not help feeling disgusted that men should be found, who could listen to the reports, full of scandals and libels on their neighbours.—The Mayor said he was afraid there was a great deal too much of spying and prying going on. After a long conversation, it was determined that it should be left to the Mayor either to write in his own name to the Rev. Carus Wilson or in that of the Council contradicting his statements, as embodied in the address "Tempters and Tempted." Since the meeting of the Town Council and the exposure of the system of espionage which has been carried on in Newport, principally by the means of the town missionary, Mr. Tucker, several subscribers have determined to have their names struck as they never contemplated that they were paying their money to gratify the curiosity of individuals, or to rake up scandal against their neighbours.

NEWPORT, Saturday, February 9.

Town Council Meeting

The quarterly meeting of the Newport Town Council took place on Tuesday.

...

The Reported Immoral State of the Inhabitants of Newport

The Worshipful the Mayor rose and said, there was one painful matter affecting the interests of the town which he considered it his duty, as their chief Magistrate, to bring before the Council. His feelings had been lately shocked on finding that a disgusting pamphlet, entitled, "Tempters and Tempted," had been industriously circulated about the town, and by one means and the other had found ita way into almost every house ; and he was sure he was sharing the feelings of every, rightminded head of a household, when he said that such vile slaader against their town as was therein contained ought to be emphatically and publicly protested against— (hear, bear). He could not express the indignation he felt on learning its contents, and finding that everyone in his bouse, excepting his wife, had read its contaminating pages; and greatly astonished was he tof ind that those tracts had been placed in the hands of the children of their Churcb Sunday and other schools by females— he would not say by ladies. He would ask if expressions such as these— "Your town is on fire with the flames of licentiousness and lust" — were fit for the minds of tender children to dwell upon? And were they not a gross insult, and a libel on the inhabitants of the town ? And by wbom was this shameful tract written? Not by one of the pastors or ministers of the town, but by a non-resident, wbo had nothing whatever to do with the town, assisted by another meddling, tronblesome busybody, who, he should think, would be far better employed in his business at the Prison at Parkhurst. The parties to the tract were Carus Wilson and Henry Smith; that was an undisguised fact, and the stigma with which the town had been branded would doubtless be most pernicious to the interests of it ; and he did say they (the Corporation) ought to do all in their power to destroy its baneful influence. The assertions in it respecting the general depravity and debauchery of our town were infamously false. There was not a garrison town in England that was so free from the charge as Newport— (hear, hear), and he had it from undoubted authority thht there had always been less average disease in the Garrison at Parkhurst than at any other, arising from such vicious habita as are imputed to our town. He would, therefore, once again say, that these infamous and unfounded assertions respecting their borough ought to be thus publicly denounced— (hear, hear).

Mr. Pinnock said he was proud their Chief Magistrate had shown the moral courage thus to speak out against a matter which ciations than the Mayor had, and desire him to take such further was calculated to be a most serious injury to the town, if not thus publicly disclaimed. And they ought to go further in their denun- steps as be might deem expedient to stop the thing— (hear). For such a false and shocking report of the state of morals of the inhabitants of Newport waa unjust to the Magistracy of the Borough, and he regretted to be obliged to further state that some of the members of their Council had been, in a measure, parties to it. They first had their attention drawn to the immoral state of the town by their Town Clerk, some of the ministers of religion, and other parties living in the town, waiting on the Magistrates, at tne Town Hall, as a deputation, requesting them to lend their influence, in their public capacity, to suppress vice and immorality in the town; then there were paragraphs in the newspapers on the subject; and at last there were found religious fanatics ready to make a handle of those pharisaical " good intentions," and scandal was the consequence, which if not met in some such way as this, the town was likely to suffer most seriously. He had some knowledge of other military towns, and it was with thankfulness he felt that Newport was a paradise in comparison with any of them.

Mr. W. B. Mew fully coincided in the censures which bad been passed on the authors and circulators of this most injudicious and injurious tract.

Mr. Pring considered at the time that the said deputation took upon themselves to wait upon the Council and lecture them upon the immoral state of the town, that they were going somewhat out of their way. and could not help thinking that their worthy Town Clerk, who headed that deputation, would have been better employed in his office. However, they thought perhaps there were some matters which might be rectified, and instructed their police to be watchful and keep the streets clear, and people moving; and their inspector had shown that generally speaking there was no necessity for interference except on Sundays, and then it was a delicate matter, as people stood about talking with each other after coming out of the various places of worship. Well, the police, in the execution of their duty, civilly requested a group, who were thus standing together in the High-street, to " move on," and they turned out to be a tradesman's family, who had since been to them complaining of the impertinence of the police in this respect. He had opportunities of being acquainted with the state of other military towns, and he could say with Mr. Pinnock, that Newport was not to be compared with any of them. Take Portsmouth, Winchester, Chatham, or even the fashionable town of Southampton, and immorality exhibited itself in a much greater degree in those towns than in Newport— (hear).

The Town Clerk (Mr. Eldridge) replied, that as far as the memorial which had been spoken of went, he believed he and the other parties connected with that movement had acted with perfect consistency, and had done nothing in it but what was proper. Their attention had been drawn to the retrograding state of the public morals of Newport, and they were anxious to use every exertion legally to stem the growing depravity of the town— which was patent to all. With respect to the tract in question, he had read it, and thought it a very injudicious publication, and feeling this, when their town missionary spoke to him respecting some which he had for circulation, he told him it would be unwise to do so, and that he had best not have anything to do with it. But, nevertheless, he thought the less said about the matter the better. He and Dr. Wavell had the weekly inspection of the Town Missionary's report book, and they unhappily knew that many moving in the higher ranks of life were guilty of fostering the immorality of the town by their own immoral conduct —(great excitement, and cries of "Order" from both sides of the Chamber).

The Chairman must call Mr. Eldridge to order. Such Observations were in very bad taste and most improper, and they could not be heard sitting there in judgment on their fellow-townsmen ; and he was surprised and vexed to learn that such a spy system had been adopted of diving into matters of privacy, for the purpose of getting up a Quixotic crusade against an evil whicb, by parties thus acting with such indiscreet religious zeal, would be the very means of increasing the evils they would wish to suppress. The utmost they could do was to put down dancing- houses and brothels, prevent broils and lewd and improper conduct in the streets, and keep public-houses as orderly as possible. Beyond this they could not go— (hear).

Mr. Pring to Mr. Eldridge— And by what means and authority do you and Dr. Wavell get the regular inspection of this Town Missionary's Report-book?

Mr. PiNNOCK— And if this is his mission, the sooner he is out of the town the better. Such a man is a curse to the town !

Mr. Eldridge— Not a curse. A blessing, I hope. His book is strictly private. No one but Dr. Wavell and myself, who sign it weekly, see the book.

Mr. Morris Morgan— It has been said that the Town Missionary had been told not to circulate the tract ; but he had reasons for believing that he did distributed them, and he had been informed that he had also given certain information to Carus Wilson on the subject— (exclamations of "Oh !")

Mr. Mew was astounded at what had been elicited during this discussion, and expressed himself in the most severe terms of disapprobation at the idea of some of the authorities of the town being so mixed up with such a disreputable matter— and they, too, professing themselves to be Christians ! Such conduct was scandalous and abominable, and was only second in infamy to the Paul Pry newspaper eapionage that was some yeara ago the medium of so much scandal and abuse, and had such a baneful effect on society. He thought if Mr. Eldridge felt rightly on the matter, he would at once cut the acquaintance of this Town Missionary, at least.

After some further stormy observations— many of the Council joining in the discussion—it was agreed that the Mayor should take what steps he might consider necessary as a still further disclaimer to the false and injurious reports which had been so industriously circulated concerning the reputation of their borough ; and the Council broke up with anything but delighted feelings.

James Lewis, alias Nobby Ducks, who had been taken into custody on Saturday evening, for selling the letter of the Rev. W. Carus Wilson, in answer to one sent him by the Mayor of Newport, respecting the tract "the Tempters and Tempted," appeared in court. The defendant had been liberated on his own bail, and retained Mr. George Prince Joyce as his legal adviser. It was told on his appearing in the box that there war charge against then put several questions to the Bench, but was answered that his client was discharged. He applied for an order for the restitution of the pamphlets, and was referred to the inspector of Police.

COUNTY POLICE

Libel Case.— An extraordinary meeting of the County Magistrates was held on Monday, at the Guildhall, to hear the charge made by Mr. Francis Pittis, of Newport, against the Rey. W. Carus Wilson, for having written a false and scandalous libel on his character. The court-room and gallery were crowded with persons of interest of the Town, and other parts of the Island. The Bench consisted of the Hon. a'Court Holmes (chairman), Sir John Simeon, Bart., Capt. Kerr, Capt. Brigstocke, Thomas Cooke. and J. A. Hambrough, Esqrs.

Mr. Eldridge appeared for the prosecutor, and Mr. Ford for the defendant. The latter handed in a Medical Certificate that the health of the defendant would not allow of his appearing that day. The case proceeded without his presence. Mr. Eldridge observed that it had been said a good name was a man's best inheritance, it certainly was above all earthly treasure. He was bound to say, his client had the respect of all who knew him, and he must say that the high and honourable position which Mr. Pittis holds, as Alderman of the Borough, makes him careful of not allowing even shadows to be cast on his reputation. In a certain tract, imputations are thrown on his character, and although he feels free front all aapersions, he could not allow them to pass, whether intended or not, without a public denial of their application. He believed they were not intended, but that the defendant, with great zeal, had exceeded his duty ; for when a man steps out of his way, on the delicate ground of private character, he must treat the subject in a delicate manner, and not rush hastily to commit wrong; because he might think there was some good in the distance. No one who reads the tract and pamphlet, can doubt that they reflect seriously on the character of the town, and on individuals; it is not simply a degree of bitterness, but there are the most unwarranted innondoes. He did not stand as an apologist for vice; but it was a most unfortunate circumstance, that when a memorial had been presented to the magistrates which they admitted would check crime and immorality, that these works should have been brought out. He admitted there was much evil, and when he had the honour of filling the office of first magistrate, he, like those in office now, could only deal with cases brought before him. There were cases of gross immoral houses always complained of, by parties, who would never come forward to prove the cases within their own observation. Plain allusions had been made in the pamphlet to the Town Clerk,—he would say, that his observations in the council were misunderstood and misreported. He was sensible of the evils in the Town, and with others had endeavoured to diminish the amount. A certain journal came before him, but only shewing the operations of the society. It did not refer to any member in the council, or to any one in authority; it was merely a record of the poor persons who had been visited. An apology of an ample character having been given completely satisfactory, Mr. Pittis telt he had done his duty to himself, and wished to show he had no vindictive motives.

A letter was then brought forward and read.

Mr. Ford said he represented Mr. Wilson, and he regretted that of the observations made by Mr. Eldridge, would compel him to say more than he had intended, which was simply to offer the fullest apology and explanation to Mr. Pittis. Mr. Eldridge had shown that Mr. Wilson was fully justified in the course he had taken, by the admissions made by himself: on the part of Mr. Wilson he was instructed to say, that that gentleman had the fullest confidence in the integrity and strict morality of Mr. Pittis, and that the quotation from the letter of a friend at Bristol, although one or two circumstances appeared to correspond, had no reference to him, and he begged again to say that there was no imputation intended to be conveyed, and read the letter purporting to be one from Bristol.— Mr. Ford said that if there should be a republication, the passage affecting Mr. Pittis should be taken out.— Mr. Hearn attempted to express his dissent from the course adopted, but was stopped by Mr. Ford, who said that he and the bench had only to do with Mr. Pittis, it was quite irregular.—The chairman after a consultation, said, that as the case had been compromised, they were of opinion that Mr. Hearn should not be heard. Others were affected besides Mr. Pittis.— Mr. Hearn said that others were implicated in the charges, and the apology was made to them, he would not be precluded from taking proceedings in another place.— Mr. Eldridge observed that Mr. Pittis felt that after this ample apology, he should not be acting as a man or a Christian to press the case.— The chairman said that the course pursued was very creditable to both parties. Mr. Pittis very properly came forward to vindicate his character from the vile suspicion. With regard to the pamphlet, every one must see that it was intended for Mr. Pittis, but no one would believe it of him. He hoped Mr. Wilson's friends would advise him better than to re-issue the tracts. He could not perhaps control his zeal, but he hoped he would not use it in such an uncalled for way. He was sorry that Mr. Pittis should have had occasion to appear that day. Mr. Wilson said the quotation did not apply to Mr. Pittis, and they were bound to believe him.

Hampshire Advertiser - Saturday 01 March 1856

CHARGE AGAINST THE REV. WM. CARUS WILSON FOR DEFAMATION OF CHARACTER.

The town has been in a state of ferment for the last few days, in consequence of a second pamphlet published by this gentleman, in reply to a letter from the Mayor, J. H. Hearn, esq. on behalf of the town, condemnatory of his proceedings in reference to his first tract. There being certain portions in this last pamphlet which were considered libellous, and particularly in one apparently glaring instance, whereby the character of a principal tradesman of our town was believed to be maligned, placards wece issued cautioning persons against their circulation; and on Saturday James Lewis, alias " Nobby Dux," was taken to the Station-house, and bound over in his own recognisances for his appearance to answer the charge of publicly selling this obnoxious tract in the Beast Market on that day. On Monday he appeared before the Borough Magistrates, but was dismissed, as the charge of libel concerning Francis Pittis, esq. by the rev. defendant was just about being proceeded with.

The Town Hall was crowded to excess for some considerable time previously to the case coming on.

The Hon. A'Court Holmes occupied the chair, and on the Bench we observed Sir John Simeon, bart. Captains Brigstocke and Kerr, A. Hamborough, esq. and other gentlemen. The charge against the rev. gentleman was, "That he unlawfully and maliciously did publish a certain false and defamatory libel of and concerning Francis Pittis."

James Eldridge, esq. (brother-in-law of the plaintiff) attended for the prosecution ; and Henry Ford. Esq. (of the firm of Messrs. Ford, solicitor, of Portsea) appeared for the defendant.

The Rev. Carus Wilson was not present, and Mr. Ford put into Court a certificate of illness, stating he was confined to his room from indisposition.

J Eldridge, esq. opened the case by observing it had been well said that a man's good name was his wealth, and anything uttered derogatory to his fair fame was calculated to be injurious to him in many respects. Thus Mr. Francis Pittis, for whom he that day appeared, felt himself bound to vindicate his character against the aspersions which he considered had been made by the Rev. Wm. Carus Wilson respecting him, in a pamphlet he had lately addressed to the Mayor of Newport, and which had been the cause of the present legal proceedings. Mr. Pittis held a high and honourable position as an Alderman of their boroegh, and his standing in society was such that he was certain his fellow-townsmen would never attach to him the slightest imputation of the nature contained in that tract. Therefore, he could not but prosecute the present proceedings, which he felt was due to himself and to the town, however painful it was to his feelings to do so. He would not say that the rev. gentleman did, by the publication of that pamphlet, wittingly and maliciously asperse and defame the character of Mr. Pittis. althongh it was evident a certain paragraph in it did refer to him, and must have had that effect had not the present proceedings been instituted. He (Mr. Eldridge) believed that the defendant was a good man, and no doubt meant well ; but he had acted most indiscreetly. According to his own showing he was on delicate ground; and when a person stepped out of his way, even with the philanthropic object he professed to have in view, he should be careful how he rudely trod upon the fair fame of one whom he acknowledged not even to have known by name. A great deal had been said in the town about another tract- "Tempters and Tempted," out of which the present pamphlet had originated. Of the merits or demerits of this first tract he would say nothing, as the libel which Mr. Pittis complained of was contained in the latter ; and no one reading certain lines In the 13th page of the last pamphlet, and acquainted wiih his client, and events which had happened in their town within the laat three years, could have the slightest hesitation in saying that they referred to him and reflected upon his character. He (Mr. Eldridge) felt himself bound further to say, that besides the false and defamatory libel he bad referred to affecting the character of Mr. Pittis, the pamphlet was, in his opinion, not dictated by a Christian spirit; it was penned with a degree of bitterness and exaggeration, and contained unfounded imputations, inuendoes, and sweeping censures, injuriously affecting the character of the Magistrates of the borough, and the inhabitants of the town generally, and not at all creditable to the position of the defendant as a gentleman and a clergyman. Whilst he spoke thus stringently of his conduct, he would wish to be understood that he did not stand there as the apologist for vices which were, unfortunately, too common in their town, although he believed not more so than in other localities; neither did he uphold the evil doings of such men who were well described by the reverend gentlemen as " the mean and dastardly betrayers of female innocence." It was unfortunate for the case of Mr. Wilson, that his pamphlet did not appear until after the Magistrates had earnestly directed their attention to the moral state of the borough, in which they had been strengthened by an influential memorial which had been presented to them, and he (Mr. Eldridge) felt happy in stating that the authorities had not been slack in determinedly and impartially using their endeavours to put down vice and immorality in the town. It was due to them that he sbould thus publicly state this fact, and he considered it was right the rev. gentleman should know it. He (Mr. Eldridge) had filled the office of Chief Magistrate of their borough, and, consequently, knew from experience they could deal with open immorality only. He instanced a case which came under his own knowledge while presiding over them aa Mayor. He knew there waa a certain house of ill-fame, where the worst of vices were carried on ; he went to the neighbours, who were cognisant of the fact and the only parties who could testify to it ; but none could be induced to give the necessary testimony, in consequence of which his efforts to remove the evil were frustrated. He mentioned this circumstance to show the rev. gentleman and his informants how difficult it was to deal with such cases. Reference had been made to him in the pamphlet, as to what he, as their Town Clerk, had said at a late Town Council meeting, in a discussion on the defendant's first tract. He must be permitted to say that his observations on that occasion had been misrepresented in the town, and somewhat mis-reported, and from these circumstances certain parties in the Town Council had been pointed to as if his remarks had referred to them. He wished thus publicly to state, that while there were many things in the Town Missionary's journal, showing the immoralities which unhappily existed among those he was in the habit of visiting, there was no record impugning the characters of those not under actual visitation. What he then was about to state was, that " unhappily some painful circumstances had occurred amongst persons of a higher class"— At this point of his observations the Mayor stopped him, and nothing further was said by him. He (Mr. Eldridge) would most distinctly state that he did not refer to any one in the Town Council, or to any other person in authority, but to one or two cases which were well-known to the town. In conclusion, he would state that Mr. Pittis was wholly and entirely innocent of the charge alleged against him in the pamphlet. He would not, however, proceed further at present, as he understood that Mr. Ford, on the part of the defendant, was ready to offer an explanation and apology ; and hs should, therefore, pause to hear if it were of such a full and ample character as he conld advise Mr. Pittis to accept.

Mr. H. Ford rose to reply. He regretted Mr. Pittis had been so hastily led to the conclusion that the pamphlet, in reply to the Mayor's letter to his client respecting a former tract, contained libellous and defamatory remarks respecting him. What the rev. gentleman had done in these pamphlets was to write against the vice and immorality wbich existed generally in Newport : and Mr. Eldridge, in opening the case, had admitted that fact, by stating that a deputation bad appealed to the magistratea as to the existing bad state of the borough in this respect. With regard to the imputation which was said to apply to Mr. Pittis, his own character and standing in the town should have eased his conscience or any anxiety he is said to have felt in the matter ; and he (Mr. Ford) could not but think that he had unhappily been induced to take these proceedings against his client, through the persuasions of others, that the objectionable sentence upon which this inquiry had been raised referred to him. He was pleased, however, to be able to prove most conclusively that when Mr. Wilson penned these words, the notion never for one moment entered his mind that they would in any way apply to him, having never heard aught of that gentleman beyond his bearing a character for the strictest integrity and the greatest morality. His client had certainly discovered, since the publication of that pamphlet, that there were one or two circumstances bearing on a former official position of Mr. Pittis in their town, which did seem to give a colouring to the assertion complained of as applying to him ; but be would most emphatically assure them, that from an investigation he had made, he was enabled to state that the Rev. Mr. Wilson never received the least intimation from any individual detrimental to that gentleman'a character; and to show the Bench that his client waa desirous of removing this false impression as soon as he knew of its existence, he (defendant) wrote the following letter to Mr. Pittis, which he would read to the Court :—

" Boniface-house, 23rd February, 1856.  
"Dear Sir,— Your letter to Mr. Gastar has been read to me in bed, from which serious illness prevents my rising.

" I cannot delay a moment in relieving the wounded feelings whicb must necessarily have been created if you supposed that I intended to make the slightest reference, directly or indirectly, in any part, either of the tract or letter, to yourself, or any other magistrate of the town of Newport.

"The passage you refer to was entirely taken from a letter sent to me from Bristol, from a party wholly unacquainted with Newport, as a comment upon my endeavours to show where the root of the evil too often lies, and was wholly of a general character, and irrespective of any particular locality.

"I particularly regret that any one should have supposed the passage to refer to yourself, as I had always heard and thought of you with the greatest respect.

" I am, sir, your's faithfully,

" F. Pittis. Esq." " Wm. Carus Wilson.

In order further to satisfy Mr. Pittis, he (Mr. Ford) had shown him the original letter which his client had received from Bristol. He trusted that this pubic avowal on behalf of his client would be sufficient to meet the circumstances of the case; and he would give his pledge that whatever farther use might be made of the pamphlet in question it should be suppressed in its present form, and he would remove the three or four lines from it which had been considered offensive. Mr. Pittis at the same time would be at liberty to make whatever use he pleased of the correspondence he had in his possession on the subject, and he trusted that the explanation which had been given, and the apology he had made on the part of his client, would be sufficient to satisfy Mr. Pittis and the town generally.

J. S. Hearne, eqs. here rose and said, that as the Mayor of Newport he could not in duty to the town, could not allow the present opportunity top ass without—

Mr. Ford, who insisted that such a procedure on the part of Mr. Hearn was most improper, and no one knew better than he did that it was out of all order.

The Mayor, however, persisted, amidst the suppressed applause of the court. The bench had power to decide, and he therefore appealed to the honourable chairman.

After a minate's consultation, ths Bench observed, as they believed the apology which had been made on the part of the defendant would most probably be accepted, they did not consider that as the town of Newport generally had been referred to in the case, Mr. Hearn, as its chief magistrate, should be debarred from making some observation with reference thereto.

Mr. Ford responded, that he trusted Mr. Hearn would be guarded in his remarks, and not make any charge affecting his client.

Mr. Hearn observed, all he rose to say was— that the apology offered Mr. Pittis, on the part of the defendant, should by no means preclude him from preferring a charge against him in another place on behalf of the borough, should he be so advissd (a burst of applanse here ran through the court).

Mr. Eldridge then rose, and said be was instructed by Mr. Pittis to state that he had accepted the apology of Mr. Ford on the part of the rev. defendant, and he felt he would not be acting the part of a Christian if he had refused to do so. With respect to the steps he had taken, he did not see how be could have acted otherwise. Let them look at the circumstances of the case. In 1854, Mr. Pittis, as their chief magistrate, attended the laying of the foundation stone of their new church, on which occasion they were honoured with the presence of the consort of her Gracious Majesty, the Prince Albert. He (Mr. P.) afterwards presided at a dinner at the Town Hall—there toasted the health of the Bishop of Wincfaester—and spoke of the cburch of his forefathers. Now let them compare these circumstances with the following extract from defendant's pamphlet :-" Of the magistrate who presides at a dinner toasting a Bishop after the consecration of a churcb, and spouting about the churcb of our forefathers." [Mr. Eldridge did not finish the sentence, whicb contains the libel-" while known to be a frequenter of the brothel."] And then let any person say whether or not they would not have taken these remarks as reflecting upon Mr. Pittis as their then Mayor, and referring to no other person. He did trust that in future Mr. Wilson would be really cautious in publishing and putting into circulation stories affecting the characters of individuals, obtained from the loose assertions of others— and of which he admitted he had no personal knowledge whatever. Such conduct he could not but say was most derogatory to the Christian Character

At the conclusion of Mr. Eldridge'a observations, the crowded court signified their approbation by several outbursts of applause. The Hon Chairman observed, that the course which Mr. Pittis had pursued on the matter was in every respect a very proper one, and his acceptation of the explanation and apology which had been given in behalf of the defendant was most honourable to him. The steps he had taken were only such as were necessary to vindicate his character from the imputations which certainly did previously appear to the Bench to have been levelled at him ; although he would not for one moment believe the censure implied in the pamphlet as referring to him found a single response in the public mind. It would be superfluous on the part of the Bench to state that the well known moral character of Mr. Pittis —his standing in society, and the high estimation in which he was held by all who knew him, raised him above any foul aspersions which might be uttered regarding him ; and as they had heard what defendant by his counsel had said respecting the offensive paragraph in the pamphlet, and that he most distinctly asserted he did not in any way allude to bhn, he (the Chairman) considered it was unnecessary to make any further remarks about it. But he could not refrain from saying, that he considered such tracts as those the rev. gentleman had thought proper to publish and put in circulation, affecting the town of Newport, were quite uncalled for and most injudicious, and not at all reputable on the part of the defendant ; and he did trust he would altogether withdraw them, and be better advised in future.

After expressions of approbation on the part of the assembly, the Court broke up.

Mr. Thomas Butler, printer, of Ryde, and Mr. Henry Medley, of Ventnor (the printer of the last pamphlet), were also indicted, but they were not called upon.
