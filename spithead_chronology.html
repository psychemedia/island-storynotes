<h1>Chronology<a class="headerlink" href="#chronology" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h1>
<p><em>A Chronology, based largely  on Naval Mutinies of 1797, Gill, 1913</em></p>
<p>Saturday, April 15th, Holy Saturday I.e. Easter Satruday, saturday between Good Friday and Easter Sunday) Bridport’s flag raised but the men refused to sail.</p>
<p>Easter 1797 - 16 April</p>
<p>`Articles of War, 1757: read once a month, defined the law on board ship. Suggested men with a complaint should raise it with the Captain of Commander-Chief. Also, as you might expect, had severe consequences for any engaged with planning or engaging in mutiny.</p>
<p>Lord Bridport + Rear Admirals Gardner, Colpoys, Pole (+ Curtis to Plymouth)</p>
<p>Lord Bridport’s predecessor: Lord Howe (to May 1795; medical retirement due to gout; Bridport and Howe did not get on) received letters in February, 1797. A round robin letter went round the ships of the Grand Fleet, that a co-ordinated set of petitions could be sent from each ship to Lord Howe. Then Bridport sailed from Portsmouth at the start of March (3rd?) for a month at sea, cruising off Brest. Howe received letters complaining that wages had not improved for a century, though that of merchant seamen had,  and issues with short-weights on provisions. Howe ignored them, seeing that several were dated by the same hand, and none of them signed.</p>
<p>A petition also sent to the Admiralty at start of March?</p>
<p>Fleet returned on March 30th. With no response to their petitions, the men combined and agreed to refuse to weight anchor. Dissatisfaction grew, particularly on the Queen Charlotte, Lord Howe’s (“notoriously lax and turbulent”) flagship, over Thurs April 13th, and into Good Friday, April 14th. A plan was made to refuse to do their duty from Easter Tuesday April 17th, the start of the action being signalled by the raising of a Union jack flag and firing two guns from the Queen Charlotte.  A red flag hoisted and two guns would signal that two delegates be sent from every ship to the Queen Charlotte. April 15th: small boats moving between the ships, sending messages and planning. Petitions to the Admiralty and Parliament were to be prepared for sending on Easter Monday.</p>
<p>Thinking that if the fleet were at sea, the men would not mutiny, orders were sent to move a squadron round to St Helen’s. Gardner gave the order on Easter Day, April 16th — and the men refused to weight anchor. Boats were sent out from the Queen Charlotte, and Bridport’s flagship, the Royal George. The mutiny began, but at least a day earlier than planned, before the petitions were ready. (Admiral Gardner: Royal Sovereign, Admiral Colpoys the London, ?Pole on the Charlotte). But the mutineers were disciplined: seamen were to respect officers in all matters except going to sea; and this would not be a drunken riot, for there was particularly strict discipline banning drunkenness and smuggling liquor aboard; no ship visiting and no letters to be sent: the committee wanted to control the Admiralty’s (and the public’s?) perception of the mutiny. Media and public broadly supportive: the seamen’s claims were fair and reasonable. It was a respectable mutiny.</p>
<p>Admiral Colpoys on the London. Colpoys was minded to try to repel the boarders, but Bridport sent a message not to resist.</p>
<p>Bridport asked each Captain to get a list of grievances of the men on their ship. Portsmouth only had a small garrison and would be unlikely to be able to maintain order (?assuming Marines would not keep order? ?Marines did not lead the action, but were perhaps not going to act against it?)</p>
<p>Seamen had tried petitioning (wages, shore leave, prize money?, pensions &amp; treatment of disabled seamen, provisions), and knew that by unanimous action, they could defy Articles of War. Bridport believed only by complying could order be restored. But the Admiralty did not realise how serious or committed the seamen were and told Bridport simply to say that the petitions had been received by the Lords of the Admiralty.</p>
<p><em>Two ships ordered to sail in convoy on April 17 joined in the mutiny, but the co-ordinators from the Charlotte told them to sail, rather than bring injury to the country by hindering trade.</em></p>
<p>April 17th (Easter Monday) men take an oath; unpopular officers told to go ashore. Ropes hung from yard arms to tell the seamen order would be retained, though some Officers may have feared it a signal to intimidate them (the officers). Patients at Haslar showed support by raising three cheers and hanging flags made of handkerchiefs from windows. Admiral Pole returned with news that the Lords of the Admiralty were included to support the petition, with the Admiralty thinking this would appease the seamen and they would put out to sea BUT the men wanted Parliament to approve it and any violations of Articles of War would be pardoned by the King. And by 5pm that day, Admiralty had sent a deputation to Portsmouth (Earl Spencer (First Lord of Admiralty), Arden (lawyer and Lord of the Admiralty and friend of Pitt) and Rear-Admiral Young, and Marsden (second secretary of the Admiralty) that arrived at Fountain Inn (no longer exists, 55-56, High Street, Old Portsmouth, road on which St Thomas, Portsmouth Cathedral sits, not 5 mins walk from the Wightlink Ferry terminal at Gunwharf, image in Charpentier’s Guide of 1842), noon on the next day, Tues April 18th, where a board was immediately held, with Bridport in attendance to explain matters. Decided in advance to accept a wage increase and pension, but provisions and shore leave etc. ignored.  Gardner, Colpoys and Pole delegated to pass message along to delegates on the Queen Charlotte.</p>
<p>Terms offered by Admiralty not acceptable to the men: a response was expected by 1pm next day, Weds April 19th, but had to wait till 5.30pm, when response was: grater wage increase, wage increase for marines to receive same at sea as on land, improved provisions in terms of measure and quality; no substitution of meat by flour; pensions improved at Greenwich Hospital improved further. Also took issue with “landsmen” as a third category on top of able and ordinary seamen, although seasoned sailors might not have had an issue with that.</p>
<p>Admiralty perhaps thought this was a strategy by mutineers, and thy would just keep upping the demands. Told Bridport to say the offer was fixed: accept and get a pardon, or suffer consequences of breaching Articles of War.</p>
<p>Morning of Thurs 20th, suggested that some of less mutinous ships be moved round to St. Helen’s, Bridport thought it might work, but Colpoys and Captains sceptical and officers knew it would not work. And the board forced to accept that making concessions demanded was only solution, though they insisted on retaining landsmen ( still made no mention re: provisions, shore leave and pensions at Greenwich) in exchange for immediate return to duty, else lose pensions and access to Greenwich Hospital.</p>
<p>Discipline: one man smuggling liquor given 12 lashes and ducked in sea three times.</p>
<p>The fleet seemed happy with the offer, but would do what the Queen Charlotte committee said…Gardner, wondering what delay was in delegates returning to his ship on Friday 21st, went on board the Queen Charlotte, but had to wait because the Queen Charlotte and Royal George delegates were ashore. The decision they eventually returned, influenced by those four, was the need for a King’s pardon with a royal seal. Gardner blew up, said he’d have th men hung along with every fifth man in the fleet. Pole and Gardner returned ashore to tell the Board, who had letters of pardon available, but these were now worth nothing without the King’s proclamation.</p>
<p>A red flag went up at Royal George to summon a delegates meeting, and committee decided to mount guns and prepare a defence.</p>
<p>Fri 21st, Bridport’s flag had still been flying on Royal George, but offices took it down now of own accord as inappropriate. On Saturday 22nd, next day, seamen wrote asking Bridport, the “father of the fleet”, to reassume his command, albeit duty would not be resumed. Wound up by Gardner, the increasingly suspicious committee also wrote adding that concessions be enacted into an Act of Parliament, as well as the Royal Pardon. Lords departed Portsmouth after midnight on Fri 21st, reaching London at 9am, Sat 22nd. A letter was sent to the Privy Council proposing increased pay and provisions. At 5pm, Spencer and Pitt went with Lord Chancellor to Windsor, arriving 9pm. Proclamation signed, 100 copies and sent to Portsmouth by morning of Sun 23rd, and on to be read on the ships. Bridport read proclamation on his ship, men cheered, and yards taken down. Order was restored, along with the Admiral’s flag.</p>
<p>On the Charlotte, as Pole read the proclamation, there was less support, and suspicious until they saw the original, brought from the Royal George.</p>
<p>Preparations made to sail; on Monday 24th April, six ships went to St. Helen’s, and several more followed on Fri 28th April; Colpoys remained on the London at Spithead watching over the Marlborough and the Nymph. but the wind was not favourable, blowing strongly from the west.</p>
<p>The seamen waited.</p>
<p><em>And there it might all have had a happy ending… If they had gone to sea, they would have returned to find matters settled; but now suspicion increased with no word from Parliament.</em></p>
<p>On May 1st, orders from the Admiralty sought to enforce discipline, with monthly readings of the Articles of War to the crew, enforcement of regulations, regular mustering of the crew and a limit to time on shore. Fair sharing of provisions were ordered, but marines were to be kept ready to maintain order and any sign of further mutiny was to be suppressed by officers.</p>
<p>On Weds May 3rd, a committee appointed by the Privy Council met and decreed that estimates for Parliament be prepared; that same day, the Duke of Bedford asked a question in the Lords regarding affairs at Portsmouth, suggesting he would request papers if they were not to be otherwise forthcoming, but Spencer was noncommittal and suggested he wasn’t aware of anything that would come to the House. The press reported the comments in the Lords on the following day, Thurs May 4th. Estimates were also prepared by Thurs 4th May and Pitt said they should be presented to Parliament on Fri 5th May, but the House was not to meet till Monday 8th May, when the question was discussed and voted. 15 days had passed since April 21st, when the Board had realised they would have to accept the seamens’ terms.</p>
<p>There was also mischief on board: one letter reports a conversation between the surgeon’s mate on board the Mars and a credulous sailor, who passed gossip that the men were unsettled and that if the Admiralty didn’t comply bfore they set of to sea, they would sail the fleet into Brest under French colours! But the majority were loyal, as evidenced by their desire to not weigh anchor until Parliament approved their cause and the pardon was sealed.</p>
<p>Bridport had been given copies of the papers that were ordered by the Privy Council to be sent to Parliament, but he’d read the newspapers on May 4th, and knew how the seamen might respond, and so he shared the proposal with the fleet. But the seamen were discontent.</p>
<p>On 5th or 6th of May, newspapers passed through a lower deck porthole of the Queen Charlotte at St Helen’s reporting proceedings of the Lords on May 3rd, with the (incorrect) suggestion that Parliament would refuse redress. And on the 5th May, a letter restated the seamens’ demands: the mutiny was back on. Ships were visited and letters sent.</p>
<p>On Sunday, May 7, 9am, three cheers were raised on board the ships , and the yard ropes, the symbols of mutiny, raised again. By noon, all the ships at St Helen’s had sent out boats and the mutiny covered the St Helens’ fleet once again. Officers stared to be sent ashore as the seamen took control of the ships.</p>
<p><em>Colpoys on the London at Spithead had perhaps seen the to-ing and fro-ing and suspected what was happening?</em> Then a boat approached the London… The Articles of War were read, coincidentally perhaps, on board London that morning. Colpoys asked the men if they wer discontent/had grievances, and they said not.  He said he would stand by them and they were sent below, and officers and marines manned the deck. They all watched as a boar went to the Marlborough, but below deck, the men had started drinking (not done that before) and sought to support their fellow seamen from their ships; Started trying to come up from below decks: “should we fire?” said the officers? “yes” said Colpoys. There were shots fired both ways, but then marines started to put down their arms and desert Colpoys. One of the Lieutenants who had shot and wounded a seamen was dragged out and a noose hung round his neck, but the mob were persuaded to wait to hear the Admiral. Colpoys took responsibility, and was simply doing his duty by resisting mutiny. “What orders?” Colpyos spent time looking for his keys and finding the orders, letting men cool off. 4 seamen wounded, 3 had died by next day. The Lieutenant, Colpoys and Griffith were locked in cabins.</p>
<p>Throughout Sunday, officers from other ships wre sent ashore, at least 100 from 18 ships across May 8th and 9th. With the officers gone, some seamen took the opportunity to go ashore and find the nearest pub selling full strength alcohol…</p>
<p>On May 8th, Monday, the ships sailed round to St Helens. The prisoners awaited their fate. That day, a Parliamentary Committee unanimously voted the money requested by the Admiralty, with news of the new mutiny reaching Parliament during the day. The resolution was brought to Portsmouth, arriving by 10am on morning of the 9th, Tuesday; though it was rough, a copy was brought aboard the London and the imprisoned officers sent ashore. The weather meant that the nws did not make it aboard the other ships.</p>
<p>The Bill was introduced to Parliament on that Tuesday, May 9th, passed all its stages, and Royal Assent granted. 30 copies of the Act were sent to Bridport on Weds 10th May. The well-liked and trusted Howe would also leave London for Portsmouth that day, arriving on Thurs May 11th, arriving on board St George at St Helens by noon, also visiting Queen Charlotte. Howe talked to the men, told them their suspicion of Parliament had been unjustified, and read the pardon, visiting all the ships over the course of four days.</p>
<p>But the mutineers still not satisfied. Officers who had complaints against them should not be allowed to return. Howe had to agree, and only about half of the officers could return.</p>
<p>Howe met delegates on May 13th to settle matters. Howe received draft of first proclamation on 12th, but mutineers not happy.</p>
<p>Eight ships under mutiny arrived at Spithead under Admiral Curtis on May 13th, but Howe placated them.</p>
<p>On May 15th, there were celebrations and processions. Four seamen from Nore Fleet, which had mutinied 3 days before arrived to see the closing ceremony. But that mutiny, which did not end so well for the mutineers, is another story.</p>
<p>Howe read the proclamation aboard the Royal George, displayed the Royal Seal, and the yard-ropes wer pulled down.</p>
<p>Bridport had orders to sail to Brest, but the celebrations delayed things; eventually, final preparations could be mde on the 16th and Bridport could sail on the 17th.</p>
<p>NB Pompee rturned to Portsmouth on June 16th; two days before discoverd that 80 men anted to mutiny and sail the ship into Brest and desert to th French side. Six ringleaders were brought home to be court-martialled.</p>
<p>the nore… but that is another story for another day</p>
