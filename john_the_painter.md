It's 1776, and Britain is at war with America, but not, for now at least, with France.

His Majesty's dockyards, at Portsmouth, Plymouth, and elsewhere provision and maintain the ships that project British power across the Atlantic.

The dockyards are defended from attack from land and sea. sea defences guard entry to the ports from the sea; defensive walls protect the yards from land attacks.

At Portsmouth, there's one main gate into the dockyard, near the Hard, where there's still an entrance to this day.

It's winter time. December. several ships are in Dock, laden with gunpowder to feed their guns. The ships are still sailing ships, which means a large part of the dockyard is concerned with keeping the rigging in order. The long rope house, where ropes are made to feed the rigging, and store houses for hemp from which the ropes are made.

*Extract of a Letter from Portsmouth, Dec. 8.*

"Yesterday Afternoon, about Half past Four o'Clock, a Fire broke out in the upper Loft of the Rope-House in the Dock-Yard at this Place, which entirely consumed that Building, of 364 Yards in length, and about 21 in breadth. Fortunately it stopped there, and did no other Damage. A great Part of the Riggings, Cables, and other stores, deposited in it were saved. There is great Reason to believe it was maliciously set on Fire, as it was perceived to break out at each End, and in the Center, at the same Time; two Men are taken up and secured on suspicion of being privy to the Mischief.

"The Albion, a Brig, with 2000 Barrels of Gunpowder on board, was in Portsmouth Harbour at the Time the Fire broke out; but the Tide being high, was ordered out, and in a few Minutes got quite clear off the Harbour, otherwise it might have proved very fatal to the Town."

PORTsMOUTH, saturday, Dec. 14.

...

saturday night, about a quarter before five o'clock, the inhabitants of this place, Gosport and the Common, were greatly alarmed by fire breaking out in his Majesty's dock-yard here, in three different places in the rope-house, which is occasionally used for the rigging house. The fire was so fierce that in a few minutes the said house, which was four hundred yards in length, and twenty-one broad, was on fire from one end to the other, and the whole building is entirely consumed; the dock-men were all in the yard, when this shocking accident happened; and had it not been for the immediate assistance given by the workmen, and the marines and invalids of this garrison, the different store-houses, particularly one almost adjacent to it, which is full of hemp, must have shared the same fate. How the accident happened is not yet come to light; but by its breaking out in three different places almost in an instant, gives great room for suspicion.

As there was but little wind, and that to the northward, no other damage was done.

An express was sent off immediately to the Admiralty, and on Monday Commissioners suckling and Bratt arrived here in order to enquire into the particulars; but we do not hear that any particular discoveries have yet been made.

It is somewhat remarkable that this building has been burnt down three times within about sixteen years past, and the fires were discovered to break out each time near about the same places of each other, and it is supposed to have been done intentionally. Had it reached the town, which it had like to have done in the year 1770, God only knows what would have been the cosequence, the town abounds with faggot piles, particularly the King's bakehouse, where sometimes very great quantities are deposited; and there is often two thousand barrels of gunpowder in the grand magazine, which is situated at the lower end of the High-street: happy for us that but very few were there at this time, and we hope that, through the interposition of the principal inhabitants, before it is too late, these dangerous things, especially the public ones, will be speedily removed out of the town. There was a vessel in the harbour, and very near to the dockyard, with about two thousand barrels of gunpowder on board, at the time of the fire, which was brought from London for the use of this port; but no accident happened from hence, as she was towed out of the harbour by the men of wars boats. If danger was expected from this gunpowder *a-float* what a situation must the town be in when such amazing quantities are in it, and surrounded with fires, chimnies, &c. day and night?

...

A party of the dragoon guards arrived here with 50,000*l.* sterling, to pay the artificers and labourers at this dock yard.

COUNTRY NEWs.

*Portsmouth, Dec. 13.* The Comptroller, and several of the Commissioners of the Navy, having been for several days past examining into the state of the Dock-yard in consequence of the late fire, and of persons on whom the slightest suspicions had fallen, but had not been able to detain any one, the suspicions appearing to be grounless. The damage sustained is the rope-house, and a few stores, and rigging to the Princess Amelia, now fitting out, and the workmen's tools. The greatest loss is the want of the rope-house, for now the ropemakers and spinners are going to the other Dock-yards to work until a temporary place can be built for them here, which will take up a considerable time.

PORTSMOUTH, SATURDAY, Jan. 18.

...

On Wednesday was found in the hemp-house belonging to the dock-yard, (in which is deposited several hundred, tons of hemp) a piece of wood about a foot long, hollowed out and filed with gunpowder, with a tin box at the end about the size of a pound cannister, filled with combustibles, and the top punched full of holes; it was found under a large body of hemp, and appeared to have been set on fire, but had not the effect the perpetrator intended; which, it is supposed, was to have set that room on fire at the time the ropehouse was. From the above circumstances, there cannot remain a doubt but the different fires which have happened in the dock-yard were done by design, and not by accident. The box was on Thursday sent up to the Admiralty.

Kentish Gazette - Wednesday 22 January 1777

A letter from Bristol, dated January 6, says,

Last night, or early this morning, a diabolical scheme was discovered for destroying the whole shippings and greatest part of this city, but, thank God, it proved abortive. Combustibles were laid in four ships, at a great distance from each other, and supposed intended to take effect at the same time; only one of them however got to any head, and that was very miraculously put out; at the same time a box of combustibles was conveyed into an oil warehouse, but that also missed of the desired effect. The whole city are in great consternation, and God only knows where it will end. Five hundred guineas are offered for the discovery the incendiaries."

A letter from Portsmouth, dated Jan. 16. says,

"Yesterday was very fortunately discovered, by the removal of some hemp, in the great hemp storehouse, in the Dock-yard, at this Port, a piece of wood hollowed out and filled with cumbustible matter, which was covered with tin, full of holes, to admit air, and a tube and match to each end. This instrument had been secretly conveyed under some refuse of hemp, with evident intention to set fire thereto. There is reason to believe, the match had been lighted, but providentially went out before the machine took fire. This discovery may tend to convince the Public, that the three late fires in the Dock-yard, which by many were imputed to accident, were perpetrated by some incendiaries. It is to be hoped that such measures will now be taken as may effectually prevent these great calamities in future, and that such enquiries will be made as may lead to conviction and punishment of the offenders. If this contrivance had taken place, it would have happened at a period when many persons are inclined to think we are at the eve of a foreign war; and so considerable is the present stock of hemp, that if the discovery had not been timely made, the consequences might have been fatal."

Manchester Mercury - Tuesday 21 January 1777

It now appears that the late Fire which happened at Portsmouth Dock Yard was premeditated and malicious, and although it had not the desired Effect of our Enemies most ardent Wishes, yet nothing is more certain than their diabolical Intentions; for on Wednesday Morning, in clearing away the Ruins of the Rope-walk, to begin its rebuilding, a Tin Box, curiously constructed, holding Matches, and a Vial of spirits of Wine, was found. The Matches were in a great Measure burnt out, and too great a Quantity of Flax and other stuff thrown upon it, not given it sufficient Air, had extinguished it before the expected Explosion of the spirits took Place; to whom we are indebted to for this Time and a suitable Reward are the only likely Means of discovering; but it is generally supposed some Persons connected with the American Rebels.

...

By a letter from Bristol we learn, that as the Constables were conveying a man to Bridewell on suspicion of the late horrid attempt to fire that city, he told them that if they would let him back to fhe Council-house, he would disovet something of moment; when he came there, he took out of his pocket a tinder-box and some gunpowder, and said that it was intended to set fire to an Alderman's house.

FIFTY POUNDS REWARD

WHEREAS there is strong reason to suspect that the Ropehouse in his Majesty's Dock-yard at Portsmouth was, on the 7th of December wickedly and maliciously set on fire, and whereas several attempts (some of which have taken effect) have been made to set fire to the city of Bristol, and there is reason to suppose the incendiary or incendiaries may have been the same in both cases, the following descrption of a person who was seen in the Ropehouse in Portsmouyh yard on the day the said fire happened, and whose conduct was suspicious, is now published, in hopes that, on his apprehension, some light may thrown on these two dreadful transactions:— He was called JOHN, and is a PAINTER, said he worked as such last summer with one Golding, at Titchfield, in Hampshire; he is about twenty-five or twenty-six years of age, about five feet seven inches high, rather thin in person and thin visaged, smooth faced, of a fair complexion, with whitish eye-lids, wore his own hair, which is of a light sandy colour, neither tied nor curled, he had on a chocolate coloured surtout coat faded, a rusty hat, rather smartly cocked, with a fantail behind.

Whoever will apprehend the said JOHN, and bring him before a magistrate, or give such notice as may be the means of his being apprehended, so that he may be produced to his Majesty's Commissioners of the Navy or to the Commissioners his Majesty's Navy in London, shall receive FIFTY POUNDs Reward, to be paid bythe said Commissioners; or if the said person, knowing himself to be innocent, will voluntarily appear before Commissioner Gambier at Portsmouth, or the Commissioners of London, he shall himself be entitled to the same reward.

Hampshire Chronicle - Monday 27 January 1777

*Letter from Bristol, to tbe Printers of the Hampshire Chronicle, dated Jan. 22, 1777.*

"A discovery was made on Thursday morning last of a most wicked and diabolical plot, which might have terminated in the general conflagration of this city, the loss of many lives, and the total ruin of thousands. Early in the morning a fire broke out on the deck of the Savannah La Mar, a vessel belonging to Messrs. Meyler and Maxse, lying at the quay, and bound for Jamaica, which, before it could be extinguished, communicated itself to the mizen mast, and did other damage. It evidently appeared to have been designedly done. This opinion was soon after confirmed by the discovery of some combustible materials placed on board the Fame, lying a distance from the Savannah La Mar, and destined for the same voyage, which fortunately did not take the like effect. A third attempt was made on the Hibernia, Capt. Knethell, a Corke trader, situate at another part the quay, on board of which was found a bottle of turpentine besides other inflammable matters. The intended wickedness of those villains did not stop here, for they broke open a warehouse of Messrs. Morgan and Sons, druggists, in Cypher-lane, Corn-street, and therein set fire to a box, in which they had also put some combustibles, which happily went out. Several pieces of touch paper were found just by.

"Their first attempt having proved abortive, on Sunday morning a second was made to burn the town, which proved rather more successful than the first; for about seven o'clock the most dreadful fire known here for many years broke out in the warehouse belonging to Mr. A. Brown, bookseller, in Quay-lane, which communicated itself to several others, and in about four hours three large warehouses, containing a great quantity of Spanish wool, belonging to Messrs. Lewsly and Co. and some oats, value 240*l.* belonging to Mr. Naish, were entirely consumed.

"Before eight o'clock Quay-lane seemed all in a blaze; six warehouses are destroyed; and the Bell, in Broad-street, where Mr. Ferguson used to read his lectures, was five times on fire, and was as often providentially extinguished, otherwise Broad-street and Small-street would probably have been destroyed. A malt-house adjoining to St. John's Church was pulled down to preserve the church, the lead of which was melted.

"Matches and other Combustibles were found in warehouses, which it is imagined were placed there in the night; and there remains not any doubt of its being maliciously done, as the occupiers never suffer a candle to be carried into the buildings; and what is very extraordinary, the watchmen went their rounds by this place at six o'clock, when there was neither the appearance of fire nor smoke, or even the least smell of it, and yet by seven o'clock the flames were got to such height as to leave no hopes of preserving the buildings then on fire.

"About the time the fire broke out, a quantity of combustibles were found on the quay, among a number of barrels of oil, but providentially the match put thereto did not take effect. I saw some of the combustibles, which seem to be a compound of rosin, pitch, gunpowder, oil, and other inflammable matter.

"The city was in an uproar the whole day, and the magistrates attended in the council chamber to require informations, and devise matters for our future safety. The several inhabitants in the different wards met last night, when it was agreed, that a certain number of reputable tradesmen should patrole the city the whole night, and it was my lot to be of the number; and I have the satisfaction of saying, that gentlemen of the first fortune amongst us, cheerfully engaged in the office, without trusting their clerks or servant. This method is to be continued every night for some time.

"The damage cannot at present be certainly ascertained, but it is estimated at least to be 15,000l. The fire was totally extinguished about one o'clock.

"I do not hear of any discoveries made of the wretches concerned in the above diabolical plot; but it is hoped it will be brought out, as the following ample rewards are offered, viz. one thousand pounds by his Majesty; one hundred guineas by the Mayor and Aldermen Bristol; one hundred guineas by the sociery of Merchants Venturers; one hundred guineas by Messrs. Meyler, Maxse, Davis and Prothroe; fifty guineas by Messrs. Morgan and Sons; one hundred and fifty guineas from the Fire  Office in Bristol, and his Majesty's pardon to an accomplice."

Friday 3000 marines marched into Woolwich, who are to guard the dock and rope-yards. This appears necessary, because it is easier to prevent evil, than to remedy it.

The Lords of the Admiralty have ordered detachments of marines to march immediately lo all the King's dock-yards throughout the kingdom.

We are informed, that letters have been received from Harwich, purporting an attempt to set the dock-yard there on fire, which was happily prevented.

A few days previous to the eruption of the fire at Bristol, a person came there who was at first perfectly a stranger. He took lodgings in the city, and while he was burning one of his shirts to tinder in his room, he was seen by the husband of the woman of whom he had hired his lodgings, who recognised him, and remembered to have seen him at Portsmouth previous to the fire which broke out in the dock-yard of that place. The man, after this, took the earliest opportunity of leaving the house, and has not since been heard of. On searchiug his lodging, it appeared that he left behind him the consumed shirt, a quantity of combustibies, and tin cases and his little library, which consisted of all the pamphlets respecting America, written and published by Doctor Price, and a volume of Voltaire's works, with the leaf turned down, in one the pages of which the account the massacre of Paris began.—Extraordinary as this article may appear, we fear there is too much reason to belive it is founded in fact.

Portsmouth, saturday, Feb. 8.

...

The man advertised by the name of John the Painter, on suspicions of setting fire to Portsmouth dock, was last week apprehended and committed, to Odiham goal in this county, from whence he was taken on Monday by sir John Fielding's men and examined on Tuesday at the Public-office in Bow-street, before sir John Fielding, and several Lords of the Admiralty. Two or three gentlemen from Bristol also attended. The man says his name is James Hill. He behaved in a very artful and reserved manner during the whole time, and refused to answer many questions which were put to him. He was re-examined yesterday before sir John Fielding and several Lords of the Admiralty, when the woman in whose house he lodged at Portsmouth, a short time previous to the setting fire to the dock-yard, appeared, and gave the following information:— that the prisoner hired lodgings from her a fortnight or three weeks, but the day after his coming into her house, she difcovered a great deal of smoke, attended with a disagreeable smell, which she apprehended to proceed from turpentine, frequently to come out of his room, which greatly alarmed her; that she once went up to his room, but could find nothing that could lead to a discovery; but the next day, the smell continuing, she abruptly entered his chamber, where the smoke was very violent, when she found a tin box, something in the form of a cannister, which contained combustibles; likewise a tinder box, matches, and other things, which so alarmed her, that she insisted on his instantly quitting the house. A tin-box was shewn to her, which was found in the rope-house, which she said was the one she saw in the prisoner's room, or as like it as one thing could be like another: her evidence was very clear, and seemed to be delivered with great candonr and honesty. Many other presumptive proofs were adduced, to suspect him to be the principal agent in this infernal business. He appeared very sullen, and refused giving any satisfactory answers, though often applied to by sir John, and the Lords of the Admiralty, who attended the examination. As other proofs are daily expected, the prisoner was remanded for another examination.— He was committed to Odiham Jail, in Hampshire, on positive charge of a burglary in Calne Wiltshire, and from thence transmitted to London to be examined on the above charge, which was discovered on his apprehension from his answering the description, and some combustibies found on him.

*Extract of a letter from Gosport, Feb. 2.*

"The Southampton, Captian Garnier, commander, is fitting with all expedition. In her passage home she met with a vessel which appeared to be Dutch; but the sea running very high could not board her; only spoke to her, and she giving a very good account left her; but the Thetis met with her since, and has taken her. she proves to be a very good prize, and has a great many dollars on board.

"The following discovery has been made: A man belonging to Mr. Pike's brewhouse of Portsmouth letting lodgings, a man went to lodge at his house, and there always being a great smoke, and strong smell of turpentine, they could not bear it, and often told the man of it, but to no purpose, and they looked upon him to be a quack doctor. He being out one day, and a great smoke arising, the landlady thought the room was fire, and went up stairs, and let the smoak out; but going to open the window, saw the cannister with matches that was lately found in the Ropehouse, but did not know then what use it was for. However, after mentioning it to her neighbours since the fire, they persuaded her to go and look at the cannister in the dock-yard, which she did, and has taken her oath that it is the same which was in her chamher where the man lodged. she likewise says that the man left her house the very morning before the fire broke out at the dock-yard. The man answers the description given of him in the dock. The woman says he changed his cloaths everyday.

Hampshire Chronicle - Monday 17 February 1777

Tuesday John Hill, the painter, charged with setting fire to Portsmouth dock, and Bristol, and likeise with a burglary at Calne, in Wiltshire, underwent a private examination before sir John Fielding, in Bow-street, and some gentlemen from the Admiralty; he was allowed to sit on a stool. He was asked,

Was you ever at southampton?

I don't chuse to make any answer to that question.

Was you ever at Titchhfield?

No.—

Did you paint a gentleman's house there (mentioning the name.)

I know nothing of the gentleman.

Did you ever hold a conversation or correspondence with an Aid de Camp to Mr. Wafhington?

I don't know Mr. Washington.

Do you know a man called General Washington?

I have heard of General Wafhington.

Then you know General Washington, but you don't know Mr. Washington?

I don't chuse to answer that question.—

I am here personally to suffer upon proof of any crime brought against me, but I don't understand the law.— I am poor, and have nobody to advise with.

If you want counsel you shall have it. Is there any body, or any counsel in particular you could wish to advise you?

Yes.

Who is it?

The best.

Two or three more questions of very little importance were asked him; but a gentleman from the Admiralty not arriving in town as was expected, Hill was remanded to Clerkenwell prison. It appears that he is a very sober man, does not mix with the prisoners, and confines himself to his own apartment. He is a scotchman, and, by his accent, from the North-west part.

Wednesday at the Public Office Bow-street, John Hill, alias John the Painter, was examined; a letter from Mr. Brothers, at Fairford, in Gloucestershire, dated the 9th instant, was read, giving an account of his shop having been broke open some time ago, and robbed of hosiery and handkerchiefs; that he had traced some of the things stolen far as Tetbury, in the said county, where they had been disposed of by a man who went by the name of John Hynes, and who answered the description given of Hill, in the Gazette; and that the persbn who had disposed of the stolen property, had a wound in his right breast, near his shoulder, as if by bullet. Jennings, who had examined the prisoner in Tothill Fields Bridewell, at the desire of the Justices, deposed, that he had a wound similar to that mentioned by Mr. Brothers; the prisoner very freely shewed his breast in the office, and the wound appeared there as Jennings had related. Another letter, dated from Exeter the 7th inst. signed James Carrington, was read, which stated, that a person, who answered the description of Hill, came to that town the 28th of December last, and worked there as a painter; that he lodged with ———— Payne, in that city, and went from thence on the 31st of December, staid away till January 8, and then returned to his lodging; that he then said he had been in Plymouth dock for three days, and had set up there three nights; that he afterwards set out from Exeter for London, and told Payne, in confidence, that unless he was imprisoned, he should hear *from* him, and even if so, should hear *of* him shortly, with some other ambiguous expressions. The Magiftrates gave orders, that the parties should be sent for from Gloucester, Tetbury, and Exeter, and Hill was remanded for further examination.

WINCHEsTER, saturday, March 1.

Tuesday night, arrived, here, under the care of four of sir John Fielding's men, the noted John Hill, alias John the Painter. He is strongly guarded, and loaded with heavy irons; no one is permitted to converse with him, and he is constantly attended by one of the above men. His trial for setting fire to the dock-yard at Portsmouth will come on early in the assizes, which begin on Tuesday next. Much information is expected on this important trial, and a very great concourse of people will be drawn here on this event. Lodgings are already provided for Lord sandwich and the rest of the Lords of the Admiralty, sir John Fielding, &c.

He hath appeared on his several examinations, an artful, hardened, fellow, —one instance need only be recited as a confirmation of it, and which, we are assured, is true. Being closely urged to discover his accomplices in those dark schemes, and accept his Majesty's pardon, he replied, *that hi did not desire to receive mercy from such a King and such a Government*.

If John the Painter should not be convicted at our assizes, for the fire at Portsmouth, he will be removed to salisbury, to take his trial, for a burglary, at Calne, in Wilts; and if then cleared, is to be tried at Gloucester, for a burglary at Fairford.

GLOCEsTER, January 20.

*Bristol, January 18.* Tuesday last a general meeting of the citizens was held at Guildhall, pursuant to a public advertisement, to consider of an address to the King, on the late success of his Majesty's arms against the rebels in America, Alderman Mugleworth in the chair.—The business was opened by George Daubney, Esq; in a sensible, judicious and well connected speech; in which the occasion of the meeting and the propriety of an address at this time were shewn;—and whilst he pathetically lamented the unhappy delusion of our fellow subjects, and the fatal necessity of our having recourse to arms to vindicate the rights of Britain, he fully and firmly supported the measures made use of, as the only one left us to reduce those rebellious people to their allegiance and subordination to the British government. The speech was so well received by the assembly present, as numerous and respectable as was ever known on a like occasion, that on putting the question, whether an address should be presented or no, not a dissenting voice was heard. An address was then produced and read aloud twice, it was submitted to the approbation of the meeting, when only one person at the lower part of the hall opposed it, who giving no reason for it, he was turned out by some near him, and it was then unanimously agreed to and signed.—The following citizens, were proposed... Esqrs. It was then agreed that sir James ..Esqr. .., B. Chester and Rich. Combe, Esqrs. members of parliament, be desired to attend the deputation—and that his Grace the Duke of Beaufort, and Lord Clifford, be visited upon by the gentlemen deputed, to request the honour of their attendance also on the occasion.—It was ordered, that the address should remain at the Taylor's-hall 'till saturday evening for signing.

Thursday morning a providential discovery was made of a most diabolical plot, which might have terminated in the general conflagration of this city, the loss of many lives, and perhaps the ruin of thousands.—Early that morning a fire was perceived on the deck of the savanna La Mar, a vessel belonging to Messrs. Meyler and Maxse, lying at the Quay, and bound for Jamaica, which, before it could be extinguished, communicated itself to the mizen mast, and did other damage. It evidently appeared to have been designedly done. This opinion was soon after confirmed by the discovery of some combustible materials placed on board the same, lying at a distance from the savanna La Mar, and destined for the same voyage, which fortunately did not take the like effect. A third attempt was made on the Hibernia, Capt. Knethell, a Cork trader, situated at another part of the Quay; on board this vessel was found a bottle of turpentine, besides other inflammable matters. The intended wickedness of those villains did not stop here, for they broke open a warehouse of Messrs. Morgan and sons, druggists, in Cypher-lane, Corn-street, and therein set fire to a box, in which they had also put some combustibles, which happily went out. several pieces of touch-paper were found just by. As liberal rewards are offered for apprehending those daring offenders, 'tis to be hoped they will be speedily brought to justice.

The following Advertisement appears in saturday night's Gazette.

*st. James's, Jan. 18.* Whereas it has been humbly represented to the King, that in the night of Wednesday last the 15th instant, or early in the morning of Thursday last the 16th instant, the ship savannah La Mar, lying near the Crane No. 8, at Bristol Quay, and also the ship Fame, lying at another part of the said Quay, were wilfully and maliciously set on fire, whereby not only those vessels, but likewise the other ships and vessels at the Quay, and all that part of the town, were in the most imminent danger of being totally burnt and destroyed; and also that at the same time the ship Hibernia, lying at the said Quay, was attempted to be set on fire; and likewise that at the same time a warehouse, situate in Cypher-lane near Corn-street, the property of Mess. James Morgan and sons, was attempted to be burnt, the said warehouse having been broken open, and a box therein, containing several combustible materials, set on fire; his Majesty, for the better discovering and bringing to Justice the persons concerned in the said atrocious offences, is hereby pleased to grant his most gracious pardon to any of the offenders, (except the person or persons who actually set fire to the said ship or warehouse) who shall discover his or her accomplice or accomplices therein, so that he, she, or they, may be apprehended and convicted thereof. SUFFOLK.

And, as a further encouragement for bringing to punishment the person or persons who committed the atrocious crime of setting the said ships on fire, the Mayor and Aldermen of the city of Bristol do hereby promise a reward of One Hundred Guineas, the society of Merchants-Venturers of the city of Bristol One Hundred Guineas, Mess. Meyler and Maxse and Davis and Protheroe, Merchants, One Hundred Guineas, Mess. Morgan and sons, Fifty Guineas, and the Proprietors of the several Fire-offices, One Hundred and Fifty Guineas.

*Just as our paper was going to press, we received an Express from Bristol, with the following melancholy intelligence. Our correspondent's letter is dated, sunday morning 12 o'clock:*

"The city of Bristol seems threatened with destruction. This morning about six o'clock a fire, the most dreadful known for many years in this city, broke out in the warehouse of Mr. A. Brown, bookseller, and communicated to those of Mr. Lewsley, in Bell-lane, which were almost all full of spanish wool. Matches and other combustibles were discovered in the warehouses; which, it is imagined, were placed there in the night, tho' the fire did not appear 'till the hour abovementioned. Most of the wool, &c. was saved, though greatly damaged; but the warehouses, which form one side of Bell-lane are entirely consumed. The Bell tavern, on the other side the lane, caught fire three or four times, but by the assistance of the engines, which were well supplied with water, it was prevented from spreading farther; which had it done, in all probability not only that lane, but the greatest part of Broad-street and small-street must have been destroyed.

"About the time that the fire broke out, a quantity of combustibles were found on the Key, among a number of barrels of oil, to which the villains had attempted to set fire, but providentially were disappointed in their diabolical scheme.

"These alarming circumstances have determined the principal inhabitants to patrole the city every night:

"*Postscript,—One o'clock.* I am just returned from the Council-house where several persons have been examined; most of whom were discharged. Two however, I am informed, are sent to Bridewell:

"Thank God, the fire is now extinguished."

Leeds Intelligencer - Tuesday 28 January 1777

An evening paper says, that an express arrived early yesterday morning at the secretary of state's office from Bristol, which place he left on saturday morning at nine o'clock, and brings the very serious and alarming intelligence, "That the town had been wickedly and maliciously set on fire on Friday night, in several different places at the same time; that very considerable damage had been done in Corn-street, Cypher-lane, and the buildings along the Quay; that the fire continued to rage furiously when the express left Bristol, and that they had sent to Gloucester for a regiment of dragoons." These advices add, "That some violent Americans in that city were suspected of being incendiaries, in revenge for the Address to his Majesty, which was voted on Tuesday last, congratulating him on the success of his arms against the American rebels."

...

It is evident from the accounts received from Portsmouth and Bristol, that there are in this kingdom some desparate partisans of the American Rebels, who finding that Great Britain is likely to gain a decisive victory in the field, are endeavouring, by the most hellish plots, to undermine her glory, and prevent her success. Of all bad characters an incendiary is the foulest. He acts as an assassin armed with the most dreadful of mischiefs, and in executing his diabolical purposes, he involves the innocent and the guilty in the same remedyless ruin. May every being so lost to humanity live an object of conscience-goading pain, and die an object of universal contempt.

*Extract of a letter from Bristol, Jan. 19.*

We are all in uproar; for this morning Key-lane was all in a blaze, but happily it did not burn above six warehouses; and the Bell in Broad-street, where Mr. Ferguson used to read his Lectures, was five times on fire, but received little damage. As the people were about the fire, they found some of the combustibles, which I saw; they seemed to be a compound of rosin, pitch, gunpowder, oil, and other inflammable matter. several people are taken up on suspicion. I am told, that as one man was going to Bridewell, he said to the Constables, that if they would let him go back to the Council-house, he would discover something of moment; when he came there, he took out of his pocket tinder-box, and some gunpowder, and said that it was intended to set fire to an Alderman's house."

It having been represented to his Majesty, that on sunday morning last, the 19th instant, about seven o'clock, a dreadful fire broke out in a range of warehouses, in a place called Quay-lane, in the city of Bristol, whereby the whole range of warehouses, with the several dwelling adjoining, and opposite to the said warehouses, were immediately in flames; and as there is the greatest reason to suspect that the said warehouses were wilfully and maliciously set on fire by some evil disposed persons, at present unknown; his Majesty's pardon for the discovering and bringing to justice the persons concerned in the above atrocious offence, is promised to any one of the said offenders (except the person or persons who actually set fire to the said warehouses) who shall discover his or her accomplice or accomplices in the offence. And his Majesty also promises a reward of One Thousand Pounds unto or amongst fuch person or persons who shall discover his or her accomplice or accomplices in the said offence. And his Majesty also promises a reward of One Thousand Pounds unto or amongst such person or persons who shall, within three months, from this time, discover any of the offenders.

It is very warmly, as well as very rationally conjectured, that the *virtuous* Americans have many emissaries in the sea-ports of this kingdom, to devise every base, every cowardly method of destroying our shipping, or firing our habitations. The barbarous attempt to burn the city of New-York, and the horrible improvements in cruelty for which the *persecuted saints* are so eminently conspicuous, render an idea of this nature too probable; but it is to be hoped that the vigilance of Government will equal the wickedness of its enemies, and that striking examples will be made of such miscreants as shall be convicted of these diabolical attacks upon the welfare of their country.

The fire at New-York, the fire at Portsmouth, the fire at Bristol, and the burning of the hemp warehouses on Monday night in southwark, have changed the opinions of many people in this country, who before were disposed to favour the Americans;—in short, all these fires have served to cool these mistaken Zealots, who had espoused the unnatural cause of ungrateful Children, against a too indulgent Parent.

The following appears in this night's Gazette.

Navy-Office, January 23.

*Whereas there is strong reason to suspect that the Rope-house in the Dock yard at Portsmouth, was, on the 7th of December last, most wickedly and maliciosly set on fire; and whereas several attempts (some of which have taken effect) have been made to set fire to the city of Bristol; and as there is reason to suppose, that the incendiary or incendiaries may have been the same in both cases, the following description of a person who seen in the Rope-store in Portsmouth yard on the day the said fire happened, and whose conduct was suspicious, is now published in hopes that on his apprehension some light may be thrown on these two dreadful transactions.*

*He was called John, and is a painter, said he worked as such with one Golding at Titchfield, in Hampshire; he appeared to be about 25 or 26 years of age, is about five feet seven inches high, his complexion fair, with a smooth face and whitish eye-lids, said to have a sort of stammering in his speech; had his own hair of a sandy colour, neither tied up nor curled; thinnish in body, and thin faced; he had on a surtout coat, chocolate coloured, but faded; his hat smartly cocked with a fan-tailed flap.*

*Whoever will apprehend the said John the painter, and bring him before any Magistrate, or give such notice as may be the means of his being apprehended, so that he be produced to his Majesty's Commissioner of Portsmouth Dockyard, or to the Commissioners of his Majesty's Navy, in London, shall receive FIFTY POUNDs reward to be paid by the Commissioners of the Navy; or if the said person knowing himself to be innocent will voluntarily appear before Commissioner Gambier, at Portsmouth, or the Commissoner of his Majesty's Navy, in London, he shall himself be entitled to the reward.

Kentish Gazette - Wednesday 12 March 1777

The late Fire in the Dock Yard at Portsmouth happened at such an alarming crisis, and threatened consequences so dreadful to the welfare of this country that every man who feels himself a Briton will naturally be glad to know every circumstance likely to point out the authors and perpretrators of a Deed which might have involved the whole Nation in immediate ruin. We therefore take the earliest opportunity of presenting our readers with the following Circumstantial Account of the TRIAL of JOHN the PAINTER, which came on last Thursday at the Castle of Winchester.

As the Court had the preceding evening adjourned to seven in the morning, by six on Thursday the streets of Winchester were as full of people as if it had been noon-day, and the greatest part of the company crowded up to the Castle, the doors of which were thrown open at seven, and the Court almost entirely filled in a quarter of hour. At eight o'clock sir William Henry Ashurst, Knt. and sir Beaumond Hotham, Knt. came into Court, and silence being proclaimed, the prisoner was set to the bar, and arraigned by the name of James Hill, alias James Hinde, alias John Hinde, alias James Axsan, commonly called John the Painter. Having his indictment read over, he pleaded *Not Guilty*, and put himself on God and his Country.

Mr. Fielding, the junior Counsel for the Crown, then shortly stated the indictment to the Jury, which consisted of three counts:

The first charging the prisoner with being violently suspected of having "feloniously, wilfully and maliciously set fire to certain out-house and building, called the Rope-house, in his Majesty's Dock-yard at Portsmouth."

The second, with "feloniously, wilfully, and maliciously setting on fire, burning and destroying a certain building called the Rope-house, belonging to his Majesty's Dock-yard at Portsmouth."

The third, with felonioufly, wilfully, and maliciously setting on fire, burning, and destroying quantity of his Majesty's naval stores, value z200*l.* kept, placed, and deposited the said Rope-house, against the statute, &c."

Serjeant Davy next rose, and entered into an ample discussion of the question before the Jury, stating the fact of the fire, which was well known so have burst out on the 7th of December last, and dwelling for a considerable time on the dreadful consequences which might have followed, and pointing out the mischiefs which must inevitably have fallen us as a people, had the scheme of burning all the dock-yards taken place at this crisis. After for some time holding up a picture of national horror, the serjeant took a view of the evidence which would be given in support of the indictment, and shewed that the whole of the charge, enormous as it was, would be impossible for the Jury to entertain a doubt of the guilt the prisoner. He declared, that the hand of Providence was apparent, and that it was owing to a most unexpected and happy discovery that it had come light whom this country was indebted for the attempt to destroy her natural strength, and render her an easy prey to her enemies; in order to prove this, he that by mere accident, one of the witnesses, whose name was Baldwin, had got acquainted with the prisoner, while he was in prison; and that the prisoner had in the fullest manner acknowledged his guilt to him, stating every minute circumstance of his conduct, from his interview with silas Deane, in Paris, to the moment of his being apprehended. The serjeant took great pains to shew that Baldwin's testimony was unimpeachable; that it stood on the fairest and most honourable grounds; and that it was most clearly genuine and well founded; because that every assertion made by Baldwin, which related to a fact ascertained by the testimoney of other witnesses, was supported by the strongest and most indubitable collateral proofs.— After going through the whole of the intended evidence, the serjeant held up in a new point of view the danger this country had escaped, from the failure of the scheme; he appealed to the Jury, whether men, so totally lost to every sense of national honour and interest, men who could become the instruments of such wretches as Mr. silas Deane (whose day of retribution was, he hoped near at hand) ought not to be made dreadful examples of the justice of an injured nation. He concluded with hoping, that the prisoner would be able to deny and refute would be against him; but if he failed in so doing, he repeated, that it would be impossible for the Jury, acting on principles of conscience, honour, and honesty, to acquit him. —The serjeant then preceded to examine the witnesses.

James Russel deposed, that he was Clerk the Rope-house in Portsmouth Dock-yard, and that a fire burst out in the Rope-house on saturday the 7th of December last, soon after four in the afternoon. He described the situation of the Rope-house, the position of the stores it contained, and the quantity consumed by the fire; and further deposed, that on the 15th of January, in searching the hemp store-house, he found a tin cannister of a singular construction, and at a small distance a wooden bottom, which fitted the cannister, and which contained a candle stuck in the centre, and a quantity of pitch, tar, and turpentine, in a receptacle or hollow in the middle it; this machine, he said, appeared to have been flung over the hemp, and by striking against something the parts had separated. [The instrument was produced, and the witness, after carefully viewing it, swore it was the same which he found the Rope-house, and delivered to Commissioner Gambier.]

William Tench deposed, that was apprentice to a tin-man at Canterbury; that the prisoner, whose person he recognized, came to his master's ship about a month or six weeks before Christmas, and bespoke a tin machine; that he made it, the prisoner standing by him, and explaining as he went on, what manner he meant it to be formed.—-[The machine was handed to him and he swore that it was the instrument made by him for the prisoner.]

The prisoner cross-examined him, and pushed him hard to fix the time of his being at Canterbury more exactly. The witness declared he could not to a day. The prisoner then questioned him as to the identity of the cannister, and asked if one piece of tin did not resemble another, and how he could swear that the instrument produced was the identical instrument he made; the witness replied, he knew it by the seam and the solder, that the solder was remarkably bad, and he could very safely swear to it.

Elizabeth Boxell deposed, that the prisoner came and lodged at her house in Portsmouth on the 6th of December, the day preceding the fire; that he had not been long there before she was assailed by a violent sulphureous smell; that she went up into his room, and opening his door, saw him at work with gunpowder and other combustibles; that she immediately asked him if he was going to set her house on fire; that he put her off with some excuse, and enquired if she had ever suffered by fire; that he went out, and she seeing his bundle, opened it, and there perceiving the tin cannister, was much surprized; that she took down a candle out of his room, and perceived it was not the candle she had given him up; that on his return she insisted on his quitting her house; that he did quit it in the morning, first expresslng his anger at her having presumed to open his bundle, and demanding the candle she had carried down from his garret.
  
James Gambier Esq., Commissioner of Portsmouth Dock-yard, produced a bundle, tied in a bluish handkerchief, which he deposed was delivered to him by his Clerk, Mr. John Jeffery, in consequence of his having ordered a search to he made throughout Common for such a bundle.

John Jeffery swore that he found the bundle produced, on the 15th of January, in the house of Mrs. Cole, North street, Common.

Mary Cole deposed, that the bundle produced was the identical bundle left by the prisoner at her house, when he engaged her lodgings on the 7th of December last, (the morning that the fire happened) and which she delivered into the hand of Mr. Jeffery.

William Abram, a blacksmith, deposed, that he lodged at the house of Elizabeth Boxell; that on Friday, the 6th of December last, the prisoner was there, and entered into a conversation with him; that the prisoner asked him if the press was not hot Portsmouth; and on hearing that they took all persons who could not give a good account of themselves, he said, what then must he do if they took him, as he had nothing to shew who he was, but some writings in his pocket? The witness further deposed, that the prisoner particularly enquired what chance there was for an escape, if he was taken, and what sort of a prison there was in the town? and on being told by the witness, that it had very high walls, he asked if those walls could not be climed over?

John Baldwin `[On this witness appearing in Court, the prisoner said, "He could not embrace then as cordially as he  did some time since."]` deposed, that he was a painter, and having been in America, he was sent by Lord Temple to the office in Bow-street, to hear the examination of the prisoner, and see if he recognized his person; that sir John Fielding asked him the question, and he replied in the negative; that the prisoner instantly bowed to him from the bar; that he followed the prisoner after the examination into another room, when the latter returned him thanks for his behaviour, and he could make him satisfaction; [Here the prisoner hastily said, *satisfaction!— for what?* but the Court desiring him not to interrupt the witness, but that as soon as he had finished his evidence, he should ask any question he chose, he accorded, and the witness pursued the thread of his testimony, declaring that the prisoner told him] that he was a gentleman, but that there had been other persons questioned about him, who had spoke what they were entirely ignorant of, and had even gone so far as to say, he could change the colour of his hair if he chose, just as if he was a cameleon; that in the course of conversation, the prisoner asked him come and see him in New-prison; that he took the advice of Lord Temple on the subject, and went at four in the afternoon to New-prison, where he and the prisoner, between the two gates, talked together; that America was the subject, and that he mentioned the names of several persons there, and had much conversation about his family, having married his wife at Perth Amboy, and having worked at New York and Philadelphia; that a kind of intimacy subsisted between them, insomuch that he visited the prisoner daily, and frequently twice a day, till the 15th of February; that in the course of that time their conversation often turned upon America, of which country, and its concerns, the prisoner spoke in general terms, and appeared to be very urgent to know if General Cornwallis had keen worsted; that he asked him if he knew Deane, and upon his replying in the negative, the prisoner replied,"Not know Deane, silas Deane@ Oh, he's a fine fellow, he's employed by the Congress at Paris: I believe Benjamin Franklin is also employed there on the same account." `[At the mention of Deane's name, the prisoner checked the witness, and said, "Beware of perjury; take care what you say of Mr. Deane; there's a righteous God above, who deals out righteous judgements, and in whose presence we are at this moment."]` That the prisoner asked him what countryman he was; that he replied, a Welchman; that the prisoner said he saw clearly he was nevertheless in the interest of America, and was an American by principle; that he therefore talked to him very freely, saying, that he knew General Washington; that he was much abler than General Howe; that the former would perplex and harrass the latter during the winter, but the grand campaign was to be in the summer; that America would certainly be victorious; that she had plenty of pitch, tar, and turpentine, and that the back country would furnish stores; and that all her army wanted was a few officers, and that France would supply them. On the 15th of February the witness declared that the prisoner fully revealed his criminality, telling him that he had been to Paris to silas Deane, and had carried him an account of the several garrisons in this kingdom, their prefect syate, the number of guns and men at each, and also an account of the quantity of shipping in the service of the navy, their tonnage, guns, &c. That silas Deane much applauded his zeal; that he then proposed to him the important scheme of setting fire to the Dock-yards, and offered to return and execute it; that Deane was amazed, and thought it too great matter to be carried into execution one man; that he said he could execute more than either he or any person on the face of the earth, could imagine; that Deane asked him what money he'd have; that he replied, not much, he only desired to be rewarded according to his merit. That Deane gave him a letter on the great man in the city, a merchant, with bills drawn on the same merchant to the amount of 300*l.*. That he in consequence came over to England, and at Canterbury applied to a tinman to make him a machine of his own contriving, somewhat like a cannister, and stood by him whilst he finished what he wanted; that he put it under the breast of his coat, and went to an alehouse, where he was interrupted by two dragoons, and had an affray with them; that he got the wooden part of the cannister also made at Canterbury, and that it fitted so close that no person could see a light was in it, after it was shut in; that he ordered two more of the same kind of cannisters to be made at another tinman's, but that he left them behind him, they not being finished in time; that he made the best of his way to Portsmouth, and there hired a lodging at the house of Mrs. Boxell; that he instantly set about his preparations; that his mode of making matches was to fold paper double, and cut it into slips; that after grinding charcoal on painter's colour-stone, quite fine, and breaking gunpowder with a knife, as painters do vermillion, to mix the two in clear water till it came to the consistency of new milk, and then to cover the matches with it; that when so prepared, they would last, according to their length, any given time after they were alight. That Mrs. Boxell was an imprudent woman, for that she had opened his bundle in his absence, and that she had come and seen him at work, and being alarmed, had obliged him to quit her lodgings. That Friday he had got into the hemp-house, and found the hemp so closely packed, that it took him a considerable time to loosen it; that he pulled off his coat to do it, and sprinkled a quantity of turpentine all about the hemp, laying also trains of gunpowder upon the floor, and lightly throwing hemp over them. That he had some difficulty to find his coat, and after he had found it, he perceived a good deal of hemp upon it, which he took off; that when he attempted to go out, he found the door fastened; that he pulled off his shoes, and got up in the loft, hoping to get out that way, but that he found it impracticable; that he then returned below, and hearing a person at one of the doors, he cried halloa! and was asked what he did there; That he replied, that he went in from motives of curiosity, and was locked in; that the person at first said he must stay there all night, but at length he was let out; that he found his matches would not do, that he bought a halfpennyworth of others, of a woman who lived on Common; that on saturday morning he took two lodgings on Common, and picked such houses as had most wood in them, intending to set them on fire, that the engines might be employed in extinguiihing them while the Dock-yard was burning. That on saturday got into the Rope-house again, and renewed his labour there, cutting his matches into short pieces; that he wasted a whole box of tinder in trying to make his matches light, and almost burnt his lips in blowing the sparks; that he was so vexed at the last matches not succeeding, that he was almost ready to fire in at the windows of the woman he bought them of; that after firing the Rope-House, and burning the letter to the merchant in London, and the bills for 300l. for fear Mrs. Boxell's having opened his bundle should lead to a discovery of him, he set off to escape, and, as he was running along the road, overtook a market-woman's cart; that got up in it, and begged the woman to drive fast, wanting to get by the centinels, who are posted four miles round Portsmouth; that the woman drove pretty briskly, but had occasion to stop to purchase something; that he begged she would not, but that she said she must, and would not stay; that when she stopped, what she bought came to a shilling, that he got out of the cart, threw down 6d and made the best of his way towards London; that after going some way, he turned round and saw the flames of the rope-house, and that it appeared as if the element itself was on fire. That he walked all night, and two dogs barking at him, fired a pistol at one of them, that he believes he either killed or wounded him; that he reached Kingston about ten in the morning, staid there till evening, when he went to town in the stage, and on his arrival called on the merchant for whom the letter had been directed; that he informed that he came from Paris, and what had passed between him and silas Deane, and mentioned the bills; that the merchant received him very coldly, and said he had no advices from Paris which adverted to the matter; that he then told him, he had fired the Dock-yard at Portsmouth, as he would see by the Monday's newspapers; that after this he accompanied the merchant to a coffee-house, and observing a person there eye him in a very particular manner, he went away, and walked to Hamersmith; that he was exceedingly vexed at the merchant's reception of him, and wrote him a letter that night, in which he told him he was going Bristol, where he would soon hear of his *handy works*; that he went accordingly; [Here, upon a volunteer motion of a Counsel who sat at the table, the Counsel objected to the witness being examined as to the circumstance which happened at Bristol, the facts there not being in question before the Court. It was agreed by the Counsel for the Crown to go[?] no further into the matter, than just as far as was necessary to confirm the truth of Baldwin's testimony by the assistance of collateral proofs; he was therefore suffered to go on, and he further said] that the prisoner told him, that on his arrival there he applied to a painter in or nead Bristol, and borrowed his colour-stone to ground some charcoal upon. The witness added, that the prisoner lamented much having left his bundle [at?] Portsmouth, and said it contained and English Justin, Ovid's Metamorphoses, and the Art of War and of making Fireworks, according the manner practiced last war by the military of the King of France, with a French passport, a pistol, a pair of buckles, a piece of an old shirt, &c. But what grieved him most was the passport's being there, as it contained his real name; it was some comfort it was in French, and probably those who found it would not be able to read it. The witness concluded with declaring, that he had parted to Lord Temple and Lord George G[??]maine all that the prisoner had told him.

The Prisoner having several times offered to object to particular parts of Baldwin's testimony, the Judge, as soon as it was ended, told him it was then his time to offer his cross examine. He declared he could not tell what passages to object, unless he heard the [?] again. The Judge, therefore, very distinctly [?] recited the whole from his notes, which were exceedingly accurate; the prisoner, instead of objecting, barely remarked on the little de[??] of credit due to Baldwin; he was therefore [?] the Court, that had better reserve his observations till he made his defence. The [?] then went on, and

Evans and Wilson, two dragoons, deposed that they were at Canterbury on or about the 20th of November, and that they recollcted that one of them had an affray at an alehouse with a person, whom they verily believed to be the prisoner, and that on his coat flying back, one of them (Wilson) perceived something tucked [in?] his breast, which glistened like tin.

John Fisher, apprentice to Mr. Tuck, a [?] man, deposed, that the prisoner came to his master's shop, and ordered two tin cannisters to be made after the fashion of one which he produced; that they made them accordingly, but not finishing them early enough, they were [left?] on their hands. [This witness produced two cannisters, and they closely resembled those found by Russel in the Rope-house.]

William Baldy deposed, that he worked in the Dock-yard, that he saw the prisoner in or by the east end of the Rope-house on the 6th of December, and that he also saw him there on the 7th, a few hours before the fire broke out, when he picked up a smooth stone, and came and asked him if they used that in making ropes; that he answered in the negative; and that presently afterwards William Weston coming down from the loft, the prisoner went up and shook hands with him, and thinking they were in acquaintance, he left them.

William Weston confirmed this, and added, that he had seen the prisoner in Portsmouth some considerable time before the fire happened.

——— Cary deposed, that on the 6th of December he heard somebody cry halloa in the Ropehouse, and that he let the prisoner out.

Ann Hopkins deposed, that as she was driving her cart from market on the 7th of December, the prisoner overtook her on the road, was quite out of breath by running, and got up to ride, that he begged her drive fast and not to stop, but that being obliged to buy something, he threw down sixpence and ran away.

Elizabeth Gentel deposed, that she sold the prisoner a halfpennyworth of matches at the Common, on the 7th of December.

John Illenden, apprentice to Mr. Williamson[?], surgeon and apothecary at Canterbury, deposed that within a month, or thereabouts, of Christmas, he sold the prisoner some nitre and vitriol.

Mary Bishop deposed, that she kept and alehouse at Canterbury; that some time between the 20th of November and the first week in December, the prisoner came to her house; that he complained of having been interrupted at another public-house by two dragoons; that to her knowledge he got the wooden part of his machine now produced, made by the apprentice to Mr. Hommersham, but that the apprentice was since dead.

——— Dalby, a peace-officer, deposed, that he apprehended the prisoner, and read a lost of what he found upon him.

William Mason deposed, that he lived in and near Bristol, and that just previous to the fire at Bristol, the prisoner came there and borrowed his colour stone to grind some charcoal, and that he lent it accordingly.

The passport `[The prisoner objected to the reading of it and appealed to the Court upon the propriety of it.]` found in the bundle left by the prisoner at Mrs. Cole's, was next produced, and being faithfully translated, was read to the Jury. It was a common passport for a month, dated the 13th of November.

The books, &c. in the bundle were exactly the same as described by Baldwin in his evidence.

This over, the Judge told the prisoner it was then time to make his defence.

He began with observing, that the passport had been lately obtained and made evidence against him; and said, that the news-papers had published so much about him, and there had been such a number of reports circulated concerning him, that he appealed to the Court whether it was not an easy matter for such man as Badlwin to feign the story he had told, and for a number of witnesses to be collected to give it support. He further declared, that God alone knew whether he was or was not the person who set fire to the Dock-yard of his Britannick Majesty, at Portsmouth; but he begged it might be attended to, how far Mr. Baldwin ought to be credited; that if he had art enough by lies to *insinuate* any thing *out* of him, his giving it to the knowledge of others was a breach of confidence, and if would speak falsely to deceive him, he might also impose on the Jury. This he dwelt upon for some time, but ended with begging the judge to say it in proper terms to the Jury, declaring that he was not endowed with the gift of oratory, as the Court might have perceived.

The prisoner called no witnesses.

Baron Hotham went through the evidence with the utmost precision, and was above hour in reciting it. He made a variety of observations as they occurred to him, some for, and some against the prisoner, and in particular remarked, that the prisoner's objections to Baldwin's evidence were not legal objections. The law knew nothing of that high point of honour on which the prisoner rested his defence; if indeed the confession had been obtained under the promise or bargain of safety, or in any delusive manner, tending to injure the prisoner, Courts of Justice always gave such a circumstance due weight in favour of the party accused; but here the case was widely different; there was not a pretence set up that Baldwin had made any offer, or proposed any conditions. It appeared clearly, that the prisoner had, of his own accord, and altogether unsolicited, acknowledged what Baldwin had given in evidence; he could not therefore consider Baldwin as a confessional evidence so produced was not admissible, a door would be opened for the escape of the most atrocious offenders, who would in many cases be enabled to set the law at defieance. The Judge, after having with rigid impartiality given each circumstance that arose in favour of the prisoner its full force, made a kind of general appeal to the jury, and told them that it was their duty in the present case to consider the fact only, and how far the circumstances given in evidence went towards a proof of it. That the horrid consequences which might have followed were not to be dverted to, but the single question with them was,— Is the prisoner *Guilty* or *Not Guilty*? The great number of circumstances, he remarked, which they had heard from the witnesses. formed a strong body of evidence, and he had frequently found that a long chain of circumstances, supported by the concurring testimony of  many witnesses, and closely connected, was more satisfactory than the positive evidence of two or three witnesses as to fact. That however was a matter for their consideration, and he did not doubt but that they would properly discharge their consciences.

The Jury just asked each other's opinion, and instantly pronounced the prisoner GUILTY.

The Clerk of the Arraigns then asked the prisoner what he had to say why sentence of death should not be pronounced against him, when he said alod, *Nothing*.

Baron Hotham immediately put on his cap, and told the priosoner that he had had a long and a fair trial; that he had been found guilty of the crime alledged against him, on the fullest and clearest evidence; that he could not have any thing to complain of in the candour of the Court; and that his Crime was of a nature so enormous, that it was not in the power of words to aggravate it; that he did not mean, in his present moments, to heighten his distress, but he was sorry to say that he felt, he feared, much less than he felt for him. He begged him, therefore, properly to consider his case, and prepare to meet his God, for that he was bound, and it was by much the most disagreeable part of his duty, to pass the sentence of the law upon him, and he did accordingly judge him to be hung by the neck until he was dead; the Judge further told him, that he thought it right to advise him, that as his offence might not only have been fatal to every person present, but might have involved the whole British nation in immediate ruin, there was not any probability of his receiving mercy, he therefore earnestly intreated him to spend the few hours he had to live in preparing himself for eternity, and by a due repentance endeavour to obtain that pardon in the next world which could not be given here.

The Counsel for the Crown were serjeant Davy, Mr. Mansfield, Mr, Missing, Mr. Buller and Mr. Fielding.

The prisoner had no Counsel.

The trial lasted near seven hours, and during the whole time the prisoner seemed little, if at all, affected with his situation. While one of the Counsel was examining an evidence, he stopped him short, and asked "if he was Counsel for his Britannick Majesty?"— He also once controverted serjeant Davy, and appealed to the Court whether a question put by Mr. Mansfield ought to be put?— Upon the whole, his behaviour was not insolent, though confident, and apparently careless of danger; he shewed some signs of a clear head, but more of a fixed enthusiasm; and before sentence was passed, declared, "He was totally indifferent with regard to his fate, and was willing to live or die, as the laws and justice required."

The regular and exact manner in which the witnesses were called upon, and the compact form in which the evidence was adduced, did Mr. Dyson, the solicitor to the Admiralty, and sir John Fielding (by the industry of the first of whom, and by the advice of the second, the whole business of this important national prosecution was conducted) infinite credit.

Hampshire Chronicle - Monday 24 March 1777

The following is the GENUINE CONFESSION OF JOHN the PAINTER.

As published by Authority.

City of Winchester. The voluntary confession of James Aitkin, commonly called John the Painter, now a prisoner in the county gaol of southampton, and under sentence of death for burning the Dock-Yard at Portsmouth, taken this 7th of March, 1777.

SAITH,— That he was born at Edinburgh, the 28th of sept. 1752, his mother now living as he believes, curiosity led him to Virginia in America at the age of 21, as an adventurer to seek his fortune, left America March 1775.

In October, 1775, the name of James Boswell, enlisted as a private soldier in 32d reg. at Gravesend, marched to Chatham next day from whence he soon deserted; was not concerned in the fire in Temple-street, Bristol, nor privy to it.— Broke into Mr. Morgan's warehouse at Bristol alone, no person concerned with him in that or any other accident that ensued in that city.—He intended to set fire to two houses at Portsmouth in order employ the engines, while the fire might spread in the rope-yard.—Broke into Mr. Morgan's warehouse at Bristol in order to burn it, that the engines might be there employed whilst the shipping were burning and the quay, for which purpose he left a lighted candle burning in the said warehouse, and because that fire did not take effect, he afterwards set fire to the warehouses, Quay-lane, by getting over the top of the door.— Mr. Deane told him when the work was done (meaning the burning dock-yards at Portsmouth and Woolwich and Bristol harbour) he should make his escape and come if possible to him at Paris and he should be rewarded.—As a reward his own expectations prompted him to hope that he should be preferred to a Commission in the American army.

When after setting fire to the dock-yard he left Portsmouth (to wit) the next night being Sunday, he reached London and went to Dr. Bancroft, in Downing-street, Westminster, to whom he had a verbal recommendation from Mr. Deane, who gave him at Paris the Doctor's name in writing and place of abode, but the Doctor would give him no countenance, and therefore did not relate the particulars of the mischief he had done, to him, but hinted to him, that he would soon see or hear by the papers of an extraordinory accident that had happened, and he afterwards wrote such an account in a letter to him which he himself at the Doctor's house with a person who came to the door, which for the truth he relates and without intention of casting any slur on the character of an innocent man. That he saw the Doctor the following day in the Salopian Coffee-house and told him that he would do all the prejudice he could to this kingdom, to which the Doctor replied, he could not be of opinion with him in that respect for that he got his bread in this kingdom and therefore would not be concerned with him—and seeing that the Doctor did not approve of his conduct he hoped he would not inform against him, to which the Doctor said, he did not like to inform against any man.

When at Paris he was assisted by Mr. Deane with 12 six livre pieces, he asked for more, neither did he receive from him any bank bill, draft or note whatever.

After leaving London (to wit) at High Wycombe, he broke into a house and took away a few linens, consisting of caps, handkerchiefs, but nothing of value; he then went to Oxford, from thence to Abingdon where he attempted to break into two houses, silversmith or watchmakers, but without effect; from thence he went to  Fairford, where he broke into a house and took from thence a number of stockings and handkerchiefs, and metal watch and near 50s, in silver and halfpence.—The watch he pledged in the name of James Hill, as a pawnbroker's in Castle-street, Bristol.— After this, without attempting any thing, but having prepared some of his ingredients, he went from Bristol to Plymouth with intent to set fire to the dock-yard there, twice he reached the top of the wall but the watchmen being near, he could hear them talk together, especially the last night, therefore he desisted; he never committed attempted to commit any robbery but when he was like to be drove short of money.

After leaving Plymouth he returned once more to Bristol with a determined resolution then to set fire to the shipping in that harbour, and in his way to Bristol, at Taunton, he attempted to break into the house of a silversmith or watch maker without effect.

He attempted the shipping a second time, but on account of the vigilance and strictness of the watch then kept upon the quay and in the ships his attempt proved abortive, he likewise attempted on the Saturday morning, but in vain, to get into a stable or coach-house on the quay in order to set fire to it, but seeing a man lying in a cart near the place he desisted.

On Sunday morning he set fire to the warehouse in Bristol, in Quay-lane, which he effected in the following manner (to wit) he bought some coarse flax on the quay and some turpentine at another place, but where he cannot remember, and with those and charcoal, matches and gunpowder, and striking a spark of light on tinder to which he set a piper match, he effected his purpose—the match was made of touch paper, and as that consumed to the end, the powder being laid and wrapt up likelwise in touch paper it of course took fire, and so he presumes it instantly mounted in a blaze. — Then he left the town, but seeing no fire behind he returned back part of the way, till at last hearing the city was on fire, he then went on to Sodbury and so crossing the country to Marshfield and to Chippenham and Calne; but the first night after the fire he slept at Sodbury, the second night he broke open the door of an outhouse near it where he slept, and left behind him in the morning a dark lanthorn—on the Wednesday night went to Calne, and being near short of money broke open Mr. Lowe's house, which robbery as is known, he has no occasion to enlarge upon it. He left a parcel in the church porch of Calne.

At Bristol he first broke into Mr. Morgan's warehouse and there prepared the combustibles for setting fire to the shipping.

He never was in the 45th regiment neither did he go to America in any regiment.

He never said that one Brooks or any other prisoner in Newgate would be hanged as was sworn against him upon his trial, neither does he know any man the name of Brooks.

His father was a blacksmith at Edinburgh and he was apprenticed to a painter there, served his time out, and had his indentures delivered up which he usually carried about in his pocket and afterwards burnt them, which gave rise to the story of his destroying papers to the value of three hundred pounds.—those were the things of value which he meant to express by what he had burnt.

As to any merchant in London or any other person except Dr. Bancroft he had no recommendation to, or conversation with, respecting the many unhappy accidents before related.

That he stopt a port chaise between Portsmouth and Petersfield with a gentleman and lady in it some considerable time before the fire, and robbed them of nine shillings and six-pence, of which he returned two shillings.
 
The latter end of December, 1775, he enlisted at Chard into the 13th regiment with a recruiting serjeant, and a few days after deserted.

At Tichfield as has been publicly mentioned he followed the trade of a painter, also at Birmingham, with Mr. Robinson, at Warrington, and many other places.

That he had committed and attempted to commit several other robberies and burglaries, but of no material account to mention.

Declares that all the acts herein mentioned of a public as well as of a private nature were of his own notion, and that he was not advised or instigated thereto by any person whatever, except what is before related, and that he had no accomplice.

One other circumstance strikes his present recollection which he is desirous to mention, and which happened in the city of Norwich at the house of Mr. Mark, where he stole two silver table spoons and a pair of silver buckles in the spring of 1776.

JAMES AITKIN.

Signed James Aitkin and protested by him to contain the truth only, in the presence of us, this 7th day March, 1777.

GEORGE DURNFORD,  N. P. SMITH,  Two of his Majesty's Justices of the peace in and for the city of *Winchester*.  
T. LAWRENCE, of the Bear inn, Devizes.

Mr. Lawrence of Devizes, who attended the unhappy criminal at Winchester, in consequence of a letter received from him, and who was present at, and attested his above confession, has favoured us with the following letter which he received from him since by post. 'Tis in his own hand writing, dated from Winchester immediately after receiving the sacrament Sunday the 9th inst. and witnessed by George Durnford, Esq.

Dear Mr. Lawrence,  
I HAVE you inclosed a further confession of some particulars, which with the other I humbly desire you will regulate into a proper stile and publish them, for the satisfaction of the world and the clearing of the innocent.

I humbly beg for the compassion you have for me as a dying man, that you will write to my sorrowful mother concerning my unhappy fate; but in the softest terms possible, as her grief I know will be very great on hearing of it. — Dear sir, may the peace of God abide with you always. — Amen.

I James Aitkin, was born in the city of Edinburgh, was brought up from the 9th to the 15th year of my age in Heriot's hospital, then was put apprentice to a painter for seven years, which time I served out, after that I came to London, and from thence to America as an indented servant with Captain John Robertson, but when there, I made a verbal agreement with him, to pay him the 28l. Virginia money for my liberty, but after paying some of it to him, and a little more of it to a Mr. Graham, I left that province without paying the rest of it, and went to North Carolina, from whence I sailed to England, landed at Liverpool, May the 5th or 6th, 1775, where I have committed many enormous crimes since, many of which I have told you. Amongst others, I stopt a chaise or litter near Cambridge, and took from the man a bad shilling, I think sometime about the month of August, 1776.— Sometime after I broke into a house a few miles from Warrington, viz. between that and Holmes chapel, and took from thence handkerchiefs and other things of money something less than 20 shillings I think. After that I broke into a house in a town a few miles from Coventry, and there took away a great quantity of handkerchiefs, six-pence in silver, and some halfpence, I believe this was in the beginning of October, 1776. After that in a few days and a few miles from Basingstoke I committed a rape upon a girl that was keeping of sheep, to my shame be it said.

I likewise committed a burglary the house of Mr. Newman, glazier in Romsey, and stole a few things out of it, among which were two diamonds such as glaziers use.

Besides these I have committed great number of crimes of a more petty nature (that may less concern the general world both now and in my unhappy life) but I beg forgiveness of all the world as they would wish to be forgiven of God. And I for my part freely forgive all mankind, none excepted, even as I wish myself to be forgiven of God.

Derby Mercury - Friday 14 March 1777

*Extract of a Letter from Portsmouth, March 10.*

"This Day, at eight Minutes before One o'Clock, John the Painter, as he is called, who was tried at Winchester last Thursday, and convicted of having set Fire to his Majesty's Rope-House in this Dock-Yard, was hanged near the Hardway on the Common, on a Gallows near 60 Feet high, which I believe is the highest ever erected in England, being the mizen Mast of the Arethusa Man of War; and after hanging the usual Time, was lowered down, and put into Irons, and afterwards carried over to Blockhouse Point, where he was hung up on a new Gibbet, created for this Purpose, pursuant to his sentence, amidst a vast Concourse of People, who assembled on the Occasion.

"He was brought in a Coach from Winchester to the common Gaol, and from thence to the Dock, drawn in a Cart round the Buildings which he set on Fire, and from thence to the Place of Execution. He made a long speech, but what he said I have not as yet heard."

We have just received from another Correspondent at Portsmouth the following Intelligence: Before the Execution of John the Painter, he was drawn in a Cart, pinioned, round the Dock-Yard; on his passing the House of Mr. Gambier, he desired to speak with him; on the Commissioner's coming to him, he expressed a Penitence for his Crime, acknowledged the Justness of his sentence, and advised him to be particularly cautious who was admitted into the Docks, as he had Reason to think other Attempts would be made. "I intended (added he) to have given a stab in the side, but it has only been a slight scratch in the Hand." He also remarked, of all the Docks, Plymouth was the most easy to carry such attempts into Execution. He desired this Intelligence might be given to the Lords of the Admiralty, and concluded, "I have been a very wicked Fellow, but hope, through the Merits of Christ to be forgiven." He was executed on a Gibbet fifty Feet high, in view of all the shipping. — The Gaoler says he has given a more ample Account to him.

ANECDOTE of JOHN THE PAINTER.

About half a year ago, John the Painter worked with Mr. smith, glazier and painter, at Hungerford, where, having a set of chairs to paint, he did his work so slowly,that Mr. smith reproved him for his indolence, which so irritated him, that the same night he broke open a bureau of his master's and took out four guineas, with which he made off. Mr. smith suspected he was the same person who worked for him when he heard of his being at Winchester for trial, went thither, just in time enough to see him brought back to prison after his condemnation. Mr. smith stepped from the croud, and touching the prisoner on the shoulder, asked him if he knew him? He seemed surprized, and said, he knew him very well, and begged him to come into the prison with him, where he asked his pardon for robbing him, and told him he did it more out of revenge for the affair of the chairs than for want, but hoped that God and he would forgive him. He seemed not all affected with his fate or with the guilt of the fact for which he was condemned; but he complained of unfair treatment in having treacherous fellows sent to visit him, to sift him before his trial; and said, they could not have convicted him, had not such *inquisitorial* proceedings been made use of. He was calm in his mind, that he recollected owing a young man sixpence at Hungerford, which he requested Mr. smith to take and pay for him; and seemed exceedingly happy being seen and forgiven by his old master.

PREFACE

The scotch hang their heads, and endeavour to blush for the disgrace which John the Painter hath brought upon. them; and tho' the man was born in Edinboro', and educated in Herriot's Hospital, yet they say—it might be—but he went so young to America, that he imbibed new tenets and sentiments, by the transmarine expedition. This subterfuge is evaded, by proving, that he was bound apprentice to a Painter at fifteen, served seven years, and two years after the expiration of his apprenticeship, he went to James Town, in Virginia, at the full age of twenty-five. — Now, the scotch blush for the conduct of their countryman; yet, I think, they blush without occasion, when we reflect, that the natural disposition. of a scotsman, is, cunning — duplicity— rapine— and rebellion. The earliest times of these kingdoms have proved these assertions; the civil war in America confirms it; and the deposing of Lord Pigot, in India, puts it beyond a doubt. But where the scotch condemn, I acquit: and I rather look on James Aitken to have been an honour to his race, than a disgrace.— He was a fellow of penetration, sense, and observation— prone to commit every violent deed to aggrandize his wealth, or sate his passions, a strong republican in principle, an Enthusiast in religion, and a Quixote in romance. His robberies were committed on the antient plan of Clanism, which formerly taught every Scot to strip his neighbour for his convenience, if he was the strongest.— I must contradict one circumstance relative to this daring robber, and *inflammitist*, who wished to be made immortal, like him that burnt the Temple of Ephesus. Mr. James Gambier, the Commissioner of Portsmouth Yard, gives you more new dying speeches of John the Painter, — tho' these were his last nervous, and pathetick expressions. — "*lI left England with a desire of seeing foreign countries. I fixed on America, and I liked its people; but when England, the Parent state, grew unnatural in her persecutions, I resolved to atchieve some great mischief in revenge to her & barbarity; and as she had brought fire, sword, rapine, murder, rapes, and ruin among her Colonies, I determined, individually, to burn the Docks of Plymouth and Portsmouth, for by crippling the fleet, I should prevent a further progress against America, — such were my determinations. In principle, I am a Republican. I hate all Kings of all nations and denominations." — These were the concluding words in the life of James Aitken; and when the man and his motives are considered, people may determine those opinions as strike their senses; for my part, I think he acted like a Scot, and with more reputation, than many who have appeared with fair characters. But he is hanged, and his Ghost is unappeased; but why, I leave the *Cardinal* Prelate, the A---b---- of C, to determine.
