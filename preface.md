# Preface

This living collection gathers together story notes and research relating to various tales and legends relating to the Isle of Wight.

The source material is compiled, wherever possible, from archived, out of print works.

Many of the texts can be found on the Internet Archive. Whilst text versions of the works are available there, the quality of them varies significantly. In collating the notes for this work, the orginal scanned text versions have been corrected wherever possible. *Any errors remaining will be corrected as and when I discover them!*

--Tony Hirst, Isle of Wight.

*Collection initiated: March, 2022.*
