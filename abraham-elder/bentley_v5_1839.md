TALES AND LEGENDS OF THE ISLE OF WIGHT.

WITH THE ADVENTURES OF THE AUTHOR IN SEARCH OF THEM. BY ABRAHAM ELDER, ESQ.

I MET my friend Mr. Winterblossom, by appointment, at Southampton to commence a visit to the Isle of Wight together. He had a visit to pay in the town, which delayed us some time; however, we got on board the steamer about two o'clock.

As we walked down to the water he remarked to me. "It was here that Canute the Great reproved his courtiers when they assured him that even the waves of the sea would obey him."

I observed to the antiquary that I had hoped to have left Southampton in the forenoon.

"There was a time," he replied, "when two o'clock was in the forenoon."

"How can that be possible ?" said I.

"Noon," he replied, "was anciently the *hora nona*, or ninth hour of the Romans, which corresponded with our three o'clock. But the *hora nona*, or noon, was graduallv changed, till at length it got put back to mid-day. The reason of this change is rather singular : the monks by their rules could not eat their dinner until they had chaunted their noon-song, which was a service regularly said at three o'clock; but they, after a while, anticipated their devotions and their dinner, by chaunting their noon-song immediately after their midday song; by which means they got their dinners three hours earlier. Look ! what a number of jelly-fish there are swimming about, looking like large bubbles in the water."

"They are what we call Portuguese men of war," said a man in a sailor's jacket, who was standing near us. "There are always a vast number of them in Southampton water, though I do not know that they are common anywhere else."

"I have lived in this neighbourhood for upwards of thirty years," said another, "but I never remember any year when there were not thousands and thousands of them swimming about. When I was a little boy we used to call them "chopped ham :" and you know, that when you take them up, they give a kind of stinging feel to the hand; we used to call that the mustard that was put upon it."

"That is exceedingly curious, — very remarkable — very," said the antiquary, speaking to himself half aloud; "chopped ham — chop Hamo."

"I must confess," I observed, "that I cannot see anything at all remarkable or curious about it. It seems to have been just a common childish nickname, probably suggested to them in this way :— The stinging reminded them of mustard, and mustard is eaten with the fat of ham, which a child might easily think like these animals; just as there was once a time when I used to call a walnut-shell in a basin a man of war, and my grandfather's walking-stick a horse."

"Well — well — well," said the antiquary, "now you have finished what you had to say, I will just inform you, that the childish appellation of chopped ham, or rather, as it should be called, "chopped Hamo," is derived from a very ancient and curious tradition, — from which both the town of Southampton, and the county in which it is situated, have derived their name; but it would be as well here to observe, that many things that appear at first trivial, or, as in the present instance, childish, may be derived from an origin both important and curious."

Here the captain of the steamer got upon the paddle-box, and said to the man on deck, "go a-head." The man on deck said to the engineer below, "Go a-'ead ;" and away we steamed down Southampton Water. I left the antiquary a little time to himself; for his temples had evidently been slightly ruffled by my last observation : and then I hinted to him how much I wished to hear

THE STORY OF CHOPPED HAMO.

"The account of the death of Hamo," replied the antiquary, "as I have read it in ancient chronicles, is as follows : — Guiderius, the eldest son of Cimbelinus, king of England, began his reign in the year of our Lord 17; and, having great confidence in his riches and power, refused to pay tribute to the Romans, as had been tendered annually since the time of Julius Cassar. In consequence, Claudius, Emperor of Rome, came over with a strong force to recover it.

"In the Roman army was a great captain, of the name of Hamo, who in the battle put on the armour and dress of a Briton; by which means he obtained access to where the British king fought in person. He slew the king, and escaped.

"The king's brother, Arviragus, being told what had happened, armed himself with the cognizance of the dead king, and continued the battle with such valour that in the end he put the Romans to flight. Arviragus succeeded him in the throne, continued to make war upon the Romans, and afterwards, in a battle, slew Hamo, near to a haven, or port of the sea, and afterwards caused his body to be cut into small pieces, and thrown into the haven, from which circumstance it was called Hamo's haven, afterwards Hamton, and Southampton.

"It is very evident that this story must originally have given to these curious animals the appellation of chopped ham."

As we passed down the river, Mr. Winterblossom pointed out to us Netley Abbey `[TH: eg https://www.british-history.ac.uk/vch/hants/vol2/pp146-149 ]`, embosomed among lofty trees on the left of the Southampton Water.

Here the old man, who was before eloquent upon the subject of chopped ham, stepped forward. "It is called Netley Abbey, or the Abbey of Nettles, from the vast quantity of nettles that grow all about the ruins."

"Abbey of Nettles ! — Abbey of Fiddlesticks !" said the antiquary. "The word Netley is a corruption of the word Natanleod. Natanleod was the name of a celebrated British chief, who was defeated and slain, together with five thousand of his men, somewhere in the New Forest, by Cerdic, the Saxon. After this was the land called Natanleod from him as far as Charford.`[Vide Saxon Chronicles, p. 21.]` Here was the first abbey of Natanleod, or Netley, built. It was first endowed by Peter de Rupibus; and, in 1239, Henry the Third removed the monks to where the ruins now stand, and built that beautiful abbey for them."

The man of chopped ham now again put in his word. "They tell very curious stories about the abbey — Sir Bartlet Lacy, to whom it formerly belonged, sold it once to a tailor of Southampton, who bought it with a view of making a profit of the materials. His descendants, who are still resident in that place, relate the following story :—

"The tailor lay awake one night, thinking how he could turn his purchase to the best advantage; gradually he fell into a doze. At length he fancied he was walking about the ruins; the moon had lighted up the walls of the old abbey, and the trees spread a dark shadow all round it.

"After a little time he saw a number of twinkling lights approaching him. As they came nearer, there appeared a long procession of the ancient inhabitants of the abbey. He could plainly distinguish the abbot by his crozier and splendid robes. The lights which he saw were wax-torches, which lighted them on their way. They came nearer; at length the abbot walked straight up to him, and looked him full in the face. His countenance was pale and sad; he shook his head solemnly three times, pausing between each shake, he then said, 'Mr. Tailor, beware! Mr. Tailor, beware! Mr. Tailor, beware!'

"The procession then retired, and he thought that a mournful chaunting of psalms fell upon his ear.

"Well, he got up in the morning, and said to himself, 'It's only a dream, and it's of no consequence at all.'

"The next night again he was thinking how he might best dispose of his materials, when he fell asleep, and his dream again took him to the ruins of the old abbey. He was wandering through its roofless aisles, calculating the value of his purchase. He was looking up to take a guess at the height of the building, when he caught sight of a ridiculous caricature head carved in stone, poking out from the wall. The face suddenly relaxed from the fixed grin that had marked its countenance for the last six centuries. It shook its head three times, and then opened its mouth, and said, 'Master Tailor, beware! beware! beware!'

"Well, the tailor awoke in the morning, and said to himself, 'What does it signify, it was only a dream ?'

"He went to bed the third night. He thought of his purchase again, and fell asleep. He was walking round the ruins again. Suddenly an old man stepped from behind a wall: his legs were bare; but a cloak lined with foxes' fur covered his shoulders. His beard was long and grey, reaching to his waist, and his lanky white hair floated round his head like a mist. He was very tall, and his countenance was deadly pale. In a melancholy rumbling voice, he said, 'My name is Ambrosius. I am the guardian spirit of Netley. In a fine clear night I love to see the pale beams of the moon light up its mouldering walls; and, when the storm comes up from the sea, I listen to hear it rustling among the ivy, and moaning through the empty walls and ruined windows. While these thing remain they remind me of the past, and I hover round them — I am a thing of days long gone by, and the past is my present; and shall a tailor come and destroy the illusion? HA! HA! HA!' and with a loud shriek it disappeared.

"Well, he awoke in the morning, and said to himself, 'Never mind, it is only a dream.'

"His wife afterwards said to him, 'It is very odd, John, but the last three nights I dreamt every night, that the moment you tried to pull out a single stone, the whole abbey would fall upon you.'

"'Never mind, my dear, it is only a dream. What can it signify?'

"So, disdaining to attend to warnings that came in so questionable a shape, he set to work to pull the building down; but, no sooner had he got out the first stone, than the whole window and the top of a wall fell, part of which struck his head, and he died a few days afterwards. — There is another dreaming story they tell about the old abbey."

"Ah! the money-digger, I suppose? " said the antiquary. "The same," said the other, hurrying on, for fear the antiquary should take the story out of his mouth and tell it for him :— Not a great many years ago, a labouring-man dreamed that he saw a very old man in a threadbare great coat or cloak, creeping about the ruins, leaning upon a stick. When he came to a particular spot, he stooped down, and began removing the stones and rubbish that covered the place. He then set to work, scratching with his hands, and digging the earth with a huge knife that he brought out of his pocket, till at length he had made a considerable hole. The next thing he did was to lift out of the hole an earthenware vessel with a lid to it, which seemed to be very heavy. He placed this between his knees as he sat upon the ground, took off the lid, and counted one by one into his lap a vast number of gold coins, so many that the dreamer almost thought that he would never get to the end of them. In the course of time, however, the pot was empty, and he then began carefully putting them back into the pot. When he had finished, he put it all into the hole again, filled up the hole, and placed the stones and rubbish as nearly as possible in the same situation as that in which he had found them. He then walked away.

"This dream was repeated in exactly the same form for three successive nights; so the labourer thought that he might as well take a walk round the ruins, and see if he could make out where the corner was that the old man came to every night to scratch up his pot of gold. He soon pitched upon the exact spot. It was so like what he had seen in his dream, that there could be no mistake. It was, nevertheless, odd, he thought, that there was not the smallest trace of the rubbish and stones having been removed for ages; nettles and weeds were growing and flourishing all round the place. Notwithstanding this, he determined to dig there, and see what he could find. At first he thought of going there at night with a lantern, so as to be sure of not being interrupted : but he could not bring his courage up to this point; everybody knew that the abbey was haunted — besides, the old man that he had seen in his dreams would certainly meet him there when he came to pay his nightly visit; so he settled to go there at daybreak, and set to work with a pickaxe and spade. At daybreak he was there. The rubbish was soon removed, and a hole dug, about the size of the one made by the old man in the dream. He now began to use his spade with more caution. Presently it tapped upon something that sounded hollow. It was evidently the top of an earthenware vessel. He loosened the earth round about it carefully, and lifted it out. It was very heavy; and when he opened the lid he saw it was quite full of gold coins — very curious old-fashioned looking money, broader, and thinner, and quite different from either guineas or sovereigns. He carried them home, and thought that his fortune was made.

"He was in the act of disputing with his wife whether they should drive black horses or grey horses in their carriage, when his master called upon him, and insisted upon the poor dreamer delivering up his whole treasure to him: and, at length, the fear of being utterly ruined by the lawsuit with which he was threatened induced him reluctantly to comply."

"Ah!" said the antiquary, "I remember when I was in the neighbourhood some five-and-thirty years ago, I met a man, who actually declared to me, that he had himself seen the earthenware vessel with all the gold in it."

"There are many dark mysterious things connected with that old abbey," continued the story-teller, addressing his numerous audience; for the passengers of the steamer had been all this while crowding round, to hear the stories that Mr. Brown of Cowes was telling. Even some of the deck-passengers passed the rubicon of the funnel, and thus made themselves liable to the higher price, to hear what it was that excited so much interest abaft.

Mr. Brown, then singling out the antiquary, observed, "You are doubtless well aware that, anciently, in most of the old monasteries of any magnitude, there were underground passages and chambers, the entrance to which, and in many cases their very existence, was known only to the prior or abbot, and two or three monks in his confidence. It was death to reveal what passed in these underground chambers, or even to show the entrance to them.

"The other inmates of the convent knew little more than this, that sometimes strangers suspected of sacrilege or heresy were brought into the convent in the evening, and were never seen to leave it again — were never heard of afterwards. All they knew more was, that at midnight the passing-bell was tolled, betokening that some human soul was casting off its mortal coil. Sometimes, but more rarely, one of the convent would be suddenly sent for, and never appeared again to his companions, and the monks would be startled at their prayers by the solemn booming of the bell of death.

"It is very generally supposed that one of the entrances to the subterraneous passages of Netley, leads out of the chamber that is now known by the name of the kitchen. It is nearly a century ago that a gentleman of the name of Slown determined to explore these underground passages to their innermost recess; he went accordingly with several labourers to clear away the opening. After some hours' hard labour, they came to the entrance of the passage; it was very narrow, so that there was but just room for a man to pass through, and about seven feet high.

"The only fear that Mr. Slown had, for he was a man of great personal courage, was of meeting with foul air. In order to guard against this, he fixed a lighted candle at the end of a longish stick, which he pushed on before him, in order that if the flame burned dimly, it might warn him of the air being unfit to breathe. With this precaution, and carrying a lantern in his other hand, he entered the aperture, and appeared to descend some steps. The workmen, however, soon lost sight of both him and his lights. He remained underground so long that they began to fear that he had met with some misfortune. At length he appeared again, looking dreadfully pale and haggard. The lantern fell from his hands, and he dropped senseless on the ground. When he began to recover a little, he said, 'Block up the entrance! — block up the entrance! — for God's sake block up the entrance!' He was carried home, for he was unable to walk. He told his family that his nerves had received such a shock from what he had seen, that he felt he should never get over it. Between his fainting-fits, which were frequent, he made some arrangements for the disposal of his property. When he had settled all this to his satisfaction, he said, 'I will now endeavour to relate to you what I saw;' but, before he had completed his first sentence, he fell into another fainting-fit, from which he never recovered."

"Is that all?" said a fat lady, who had been stopped midway in the eating of a sandwich, by the intense interest she felt in the story obliging her to keep her mouth open.

"It is all," said Mr. Brown offering a pinch of snuff to the antiquary.

Here another character introduced himself to the notice of the company. He was about five-and-thirty years of age, and was dressed in a snuff-coloured single-breasted coat, rounded off into a kind of sporting cut, with rose-buds embossed upon the buttons. He bore the appearance of a London tradesman trying to pass himself off for a country squire, or a commercial traveller affecting the airs of a fine gentleman, — a character very commonly to be met with in all kinds of public conveyance. He addressed himself to the fat lady, who had now resumed her sandwich. "Indeed, madam," said he, "we ought to be prepared for these sort of disappointments in this part of the country. The fact is, there is very little of the supernatural to be met with now in the south of England; but there is plenty of it to be found still in the Highlands of Scotland, and, I am told, in some parts of Ireland; but, of Scotland I can speak from my own experience."

There was an immediate crowding of all the passengers round the snuff-coloured coat.

"Did you ever see anything yourself, sir?" said a romantic young lady, who was evidently come touring and sketching to the Isle of Wight.

"I saw something of the sort once, madam," was the reply.

"Pray, sir, what was it? What did you see? " came from many voices at once.

The gentleman then placed himself in an elegant attitude, and paused for a considerable time, to allow curiosity to rise to its highest pitch, and before it subsided, he began, —

"I was once visiting a friend in the neighbourhood of Cromarty, in the Highlands of Scotland. After having partaken of a most hospitable supper I retired to my room. That night I washed my feet, and left the foot-tub standing in the corner of the room. I had nearly got to sleep when I was startled by a sort of splashing sound, as if somebody was dabbling about the water in the foot-tub. I raised my head gradually up to see what was going on. I saw three wizen old women, so thin and shrivelled, that they appeared to have shrivelled and shrivelled away till there was scarcely anything left of them. They were bathing by turns in the foot-tub, and, so wasted were their forms, that the foot-tub was big enough to hold them, petticoats and all."

"Pray, sir, did they wear bathing-dresses, or their common clothes?" asked the romantic young lady.

"A mere bundle of rags as far as I could see. Perhaps they wear their worst clothes when they go on bathing expeditions. — At length I sat upright in bed to take a good look at them; but the moment they observed me watching them, their forms faded gradually away, till at length they only appeared like thin mists waving about. When I laid my head down again, they appeared to be more at their ease, dipping, and splashing, and throwing the water about at one another. After amusing themselves in this manner for about an hour, one of them took hold of the hearth-broom, and sat herself astraddle on it; the two others got on behind her, and they all three flew up the chimney together, broom and all. I could hear the thick end of the broom knocking against the sides of the chimney all the way up to the top, first on one side, and then on the other."

"Pray, sir, did not the fire burn blue all this time?" asked an old woman in a plaid cloak, who had been listening with breathless interest.

"Very blue," was the reply.

"When I went down to breakfast in the morning, I told my host that something very extraordinary had happened to me in the night, and I related to him all that I had seen."

"There is nothing at all extraordinary in that," was his reply. "If you leave your foot-tub in your room, the witches always do come and bathe in it. Nobody in the Highlands ever leaves a foottub that he has washed his feet in, in the room. I do not know that I can remember an instance of it of late years, except, indeed, one, and that was a man in. Inverness gaol, who was sentenced to solitary confinement — and he did it for society."

The story being concluded, its hero passed through his cluster of listeners, lounged up and down the deck, affecting a kind of aristocratic superiority. He felt conscious that his story had told well, and that he was for the moment the lion of the party; he flattered himself that he had thrown both Mr. Winterblossom and Mr. Brown altogether into the shade. His triumph, however, was but shortlived; for soon afterwards, as we were looking towards the island, I observed to the antiquary,

"That high peak that we see is St. Katherine's, the highest point of the island, is it not?"

"Yes," he replied, "St. Katherine's *is at present* the highest point of the island."

"Is at present! Why, you do not mean to say that there ever was a time when its elevation was different?"

"That I know nothing about," he replied; "but it appears very probable that Shanklin Down will soon overtake it in height."

"Why, you don't mean to say that Shanklin Down is growing higher?"

"That, indeed, appears to be the case, or, at any rate, relatively to other heights in the island. The inhabitants of Chale will tell vou that formerly Shanklin Down, from the interference of Week Down, could only be seen from the top of St. Katherine's, whereas it is now visible from Chale Down, which is much lower; consequently, unless Week Down has sunk lower than it was, Shanklin Down must have risen considerably. Now, if Week Down is sinking, it is very probable that St. Katherine's is slipping down too; so that, whether Shanklin Down is growing higher or not, it seems very probable that it will in the course of time overlook all the rest of the Isle of Wight."

"Very curious," said the hero of the foot-tub, with a kind of supercilious air. "I suppose the two hills playing at see-saw. — Now we go up, up, up; and now we go down, down, clown. Very curious,—-very," picking his teeth incredulously between the two last words.

"There is no animal," thought I to myself, "so jealous of another of the same species as your regular story-teller."

TALES AND LEGENDS OF THE ISLE OF WIGHT.

WITH THE ADVENTURES OF THE AUTHOR IN SEARCH OF THEM, BY ABRAHAM ELDER, ESQ.

UPON our arrival at Ryde, we took up our quarters at Yelf's hotel. A mutton-chop, and a glass of hot brandy-and-water each after dinner.— At length the antiquary remarked,

"I know you are a great admirer of Shakspeare. It is very odd that the Puck, or Robin Goodfellow, of his Midsummer Night's Dream, who appears to have been a very popular spirit at that time, should now be scarcely known to the world, except through the medium of that play. The Isle of Wight, indeed, is the only spot that I am aware of where there remain any traces of his existence. There are two places here that are still called after him, Puckpool and Puckaster."

"Any traditions relating to them?"

"There are," was the reply. "The evening is delightful," continued he, "and Puckpool is close at hand, — what say you to a walk there before tea, and I will tell you a story about it as we go along."

After a walk of about a mile and a quarter, we got to Puckpool. It was a low marshy flat, close to the sea. The antiquary began as follows:—

"At the date of the following story, this spot is described as having been a kind of salt marsh, entirely overflowed by the sea at high spring-tides. In ordinary tides, there was left bare a green meadow, covered by the peculiar race of plants that will bear contact with salt water. The sea, however, had eaten its way through it in numerous directions, forming narrow channels, deep holes, and here and there wide spaces were scooped out, which were filled by the tide at high water, leaving numerous islands and promontories around. It was the largest of these pools, with a round green island in the middle, that gave the name to the place.

"People used to come from far and near to visit this spot; not, however, on account of any particular beauty it possessed, but from the number of wonderful tales that had been told about it. Robin Goodfellow, or Puck, with a troop of mischievous and frolicsome fairies, made it their favourite place of nocturnal meeting. Numerous were the pranks that they played. A tidy housemaid sometimes, upon getting up in the morning to her work, would find everything swept, and brushed, and scoured, and the floor nicely sanded, upon which the prints of little feet could be faintly traced, and the brooms and brushes and dusters carefully put back into their places. If she was particularly industrious, it is said that she actually sometimes found a piece of money in her shoe. But the slovenly girl was punished with cramps, teased with chilblains, and was occasionally frightened to death by the rats running across her nose when she was in bed. The consequence was, that the neighbourhood of Puckpool used to be celebrated for tidy housemaids and steady servants.

"Those who were in favour with the fairies were continually meeting with good luck, and those they took a dislike to were as constantly getting into scrapes in one way or another. Sometimes the swine-herd, driving his grunting flock home in the evening, would see his fattest or his favourite pig separate from the herd, and trot down to the salt marshes of Puckpool; and there he would follow it about, sometimes upon the sound greensward, sometimes across the channels that the tide had left, in some places over tolerably firm sand, in others both driver and swine would be floundering in soft mud. At length the poor man would tumble headlong into the deepest and dirtiest hole, while his grunting dependant was making his escape, capering away upon the firm grass beyond. After his fruitless chase, he would return home and find with surprise that none of his herd were missing.

"But the people they delighted the most in teasing were hypocritical and luxurious monks. Those who were sincere in their devotions, and strict in their observance of the rules of their several orders, they did not appear to trouble themselves much about. As, however, the convents became wealthy, they in a great measure ceased to be the refuge of devoted ascetics; and many younger brothers, of small prospects in life, enticed by the abundance and the idleness that the monastic establishments presented to their view, professed themselves monks. The enjoyment of as much luxury and pleasure as they could cover with their religious habit was, of course, their sole aim. These were the devoted victims of the practical jokes of Robin Goodfellow and his merry companions.

"Brother Martin was a monk of the Cluniac order, belonging to the Priory of St. Helen's. Originally, the very severe rules of that order were there followed with the strictest accuracy. Constant silence was observed during the day, and it was almost death to violate it before prime; `[Morning service in the chapel.]` and various other contrivances were adopted to mortify the flesh. ' Their manual labour,' says Udalricus, 'was to shell unripe beans, or weed the garden, and sometimes make bread in the bakehouse.' `[Fabas novas et nondum bene maturas de folliculis suis egere, vel, &c. &c. — See Udalricus Antiquiores Cousuetudines Cluniacensis Monosterii in D'Acherii Spicilegium, iv. 39.]` `[TH: we can also find this in Thomas Fosbroke, 1843, British Monachism: Or, Manners and Customs of the Monks and Nuns of England https://archive.org/details/britishmonachis00fosbgoog/page/n107/mode/2up as well as earlier works in latin on the Benedictine order.]` But the precise rules of the order would not be very interesting to the reader, particularly as the Priory of St. Helen's soon grew wealthy, and its monks, in consequence, negligent and luxurious.

"Brother Martin entered the Priory of St. Helen's during the later period of its existence. The absence of labour and the plenty of provisions were the chief inducements that led him to choose a religious life. He was generally absent from the convent upon some excuse or another, visiting the poor, and giving good advice to those whom he considered to be the most likely to be led into temptation. He was the father confessor to most of the ladies of the neighbouring village of La Rye, as Ryde was then called. He generally visited the most comely first, as he said these were the most likely to be led astray.

"In the course of time a little orphan niece of his was brought to the village of La Rye, and was supported entirely by his charity; but many of the neighbours were much surprised to observe, that whenever any very particular inquiries were made about this niece, the monk appeared to take it almost as a personal offence. But then it was well known that religious men were always instructed not to be ostentatious in their charities, and to shrink from the applauses of the profane world. However, let this pass.

"One night Brother Martin was returning from La Rye to his convent. By some strange accident, that never has been satisfactorily accounted for, he missed the beaten track, and wandered through the footways that traversed the copsewood in various directions; for there was at that time very little open country between La Rye and the Priory of St. Helen's.

"After various windings, the track he had followed led him down to the salt marshes of Puckpool. Here he stood for some time pondering in his mind how he should get across it; for there was a stream of water that ran through the middle of it, the fording of which, without getting very wet, was rather a nice business by daylight, when the tide was out; but now he had only the light of the moon, and the tide was rising fast.

"As he stood on the brink of the firm ground, considering which was the safest point to make for, he thought he heard the cries and screams of a child. He walked up and down the firm turf, trying to make out whence the screams came. The cries continued.

"'Where are you?' said the monk.

"'Oh! Father Martin! — dear Father Martin, is it you?'

"'And who are you?' he asked.

"'Oh! it 's little Fanny — your own little Fanny — your own dear little Fanny.'

"'And where are you? — for I cannot see you?'

"'Here, on the pretty green island in the middle of the marsh. I can't get out — I can't get out. The tide is rising, and the water is coming all round. There are some stepping-stones just up above—pray come and save me, pray!'

"The monk walked up a little higher, and soon thought that he had made out the stepping-stones. He rushed to go across, putting his foot upon what looked in the moonlight like a fine broad stone. It was, however, unfortunately for the monk, nothing but a floating tuft of sea-weed that had come up with the tide. This untoward step threw the monk head foremost into a deep muddy inlet, about three feet deep Brother Martin soon emerged again in woful plight; the full sleeves of his black cowl were heavy with the weight of the soft brown mud and half-rotten sea-weed with which they were filled; his rochet, or tabard, which reached from his chin to his feet, was torn in two by his trampling upon it in his efforts to extricate himself. By dint of spitting and spluttering, he soon cleared his mouth of water and dirt; and, after taking one or two good blows to recover his breath, he waded, or rather floundered, through the water and mud till he came to the little green island. Here he scrambled up, and, after shaking a little of the water and mud out of his gown, he began looking about for the child, and was much surprised to find that it was nowhere on the little plot of firm ground upon which he had landed. He soon, however, heard again the screams of the child, and, upon turning round, he observed it standing and screaming on another little turf island, still farther off. It cried out again —

"'Save me! — save me, Father Martin! — My dear father, save me, my own dear father! — for the tide is coming in, and the water is getting deep all round me!'

"The monk, before he took to the water again, turned the matter over in his own mind. In the first place, he did not wish to see the little child drowned; and, in the second place, as he had got half way across the marsh, it would be as easy to get out on that side as on the other. Indeed, the probability was that he had come across the worst part.

"He determined, however, to proceed with more caution this time; so he looked about for a shoal part, till he thought he had come to a place that was quite shallow: here he sat himself down upon the edge of the turf, and tried with his feet whether the bottom was hard. To his delight, his foot rested upon a firm sound sand, so he started forward on his journey; but when he put his other foot before him, it sank in up to his knees, and again he fell prostrate. To be sure, there was very little water this time; but such a bed of mud as that in which he rolled about, he had never met with before. He rolled, and he floundered, and he scrambled; and when at length he reached the firm ground with his extended arms, he was quite exhausted, and he remained for a few seconds in this attitude, his head and face scarcely emerging from the muddy water. Here he was greatly alarmed; for a large green crab, either disturbed in its slumbers, or coming in with the flowing tide, crawled over his face; and two or three bats, apparently surprised at the sight of so unusual an object, fluttered by him so close, that he could distinctly feel the wind from their wings.

"He turned his eyes upwards, and saw a large bird hovering over him: — he thought of the Eastern tales that he had heard of, — eagles and vultures tearing the flesh from the bones of their victims before they were dead. At length it uttered a loud hooting sound, which he recognised as that of the yellow owl. He then heard with dismay the whirring prolonged note of the goatsucker, which sounds so melancholy and unearthly. The monk gave another plunge to extricate himself from his slimy bed, but was again startled by another sound, totally unlike anything he had ever heard before — *Wha, whee, wha, whee, wha whee,* — repeated many times in rapid succession. He tried to discover whence it came, but could see nothing but a number of oysters lying along the edge of the water, opening their shells and shutting them one after the other. The sounds he thought evidently came from them. 'Horrible! horrible!' thought he; 'they must be possessed by demons, and that is their note of laughter.' He plunged again to extricate himself, and, as he plunged, he began 'Exorcise te,' &c. But his exorcism was suddenly arrested by a lump of mud and sand flying into his mouth, and almost going down his throat.

"A violent effort at length freed him from his unpleasant situation, and once more he stood upon firm ground; but he was now so completely frightened, and so entirely did he lose his presence of mind, if he ever possessed it, that he thought of nothing but escaping from his present horrors. The danger of the unfortunate child in his fear he forgot altogether, or concluded that it was a mere trick of evil spirits; so he ran away in the direction of the Priory of St. Helen's as fast as he could. But his career did not continue long without disaster; for in his haste he did not proceed with his accustomed caution. His foot dropped into a hole, and again he was doomed to fall; but this time, luckily for him, with the exception of one leg, he fell upon dry ground.

"Whether it was his fears that conjured up forms, or whether it was reality, he thought that the green crabs were again running over him, the bats flapping their wings in his face, and the owl hooting over head; but, at any rate, he felt quite sure that he heard distinctly in the distance behind him the oysters laughing at him in their former peculiar note, *Wha, whee, wha, whee*. He soon jumped upon his legs again, nor did he stop until he reached the gates of the convent. As he ran, he heard a sound like that of wind whistling by his ears, and then he felt something cold laid upon his cheek, — cold and clammy like a dead man's hand: he trembled and shook, and ran on the faster.

"The porter was astonished at his appearance; and well he might be: his black monastic dress had been changed to a rich brown, and little streamers of sea-weed fluttered in various directions. One side of his face was plastered with brown and black mud, while the other showed its accustomed rosy shining fatness. He ran directly to the prior, and told him that Brother Martin had returned in woful plight, and appeared to be deprived of his reason. He was ordered into the presence of his superior. The prior received him in his parlour. He was sitting in his sculptured easy arm-chair, with his clasped hands resting upon his portly paunch, while his eyes staring wide open, showed the astonishment with which he viewed the strange alterations that had taken place in the monastic habit and countenance of Brother Martin.

"Brother Martin was directed to change his dress and to purify himself; an operation which was soon accomplished, for monks were never celebrated for cleanliness. Indeed, this was one of the particulars in which they used to cheat the world; for the uninitiated ignorantly imagined that the filth in which they lived was a kind of penance, and they were taught to revere it under the name of the 'odour of sanctity,' — whereas the fact was that the monks delighted in dirt, — it was one of their luxuries.

"When the unfortunate brother reappeared, he commenced his story. He told how he had been led astray from the beaten path by some unknown and mysterious influence, and how at length he found himself by the waters of Puckpool. He then began to generalise a little. The screams of his own dear little Fanny were simply described as the cries of a fellow-creature in distress. He went on to tell how he plunged into the swelling ocean, regardless of all personal risk, in the hopes of being able to save this fellow-creature from a watery grave, — how he was nearly drowned in the deep water, — how he was nearly smothered in the mud, — how he was haunted by demons in every shape, — how the owl hooted over him, — how the bats flapped their wings in his face, and the green crabs crawled over his cheek, — how hideous sounds were heard on every side, — how the oysters, by the power of some strange enchantment, opened their shells and laughed at him.

"'Why did you not repeat the "Exorciso te"?' asked the prior.

"'I did attempt it; but no sooner had I opened my mouth than one of the demons threw a piece of mud down my throat that nearly choked me. At length I extricated myself, and ran away; and, though I was again thrown down by violence, and once more surrounded by my tormentors, I got up, and, as I ran away again, I felt the cold hand of a dead man placed upon my cheek.'

"'Might it not have been the end of your wet hood that blew up?' asked the prior.

"'Impossible. — As I came on, I thought to myself —'

"'Stop!' said the prior, with pompous gravity; 'you know the rules of our order, — you ought to have continued singing psalms inwardly to yourself, to prevent vain thoughts and idle imaginings from entering into your mind. `[The monks of this order, whatever their occupation was, were directed constantly to sing psalms to themselves, with the exception of the master baker. The reason of this exception, was to prevent the saliva from dropping into the dough. — See Fosbroke's Monasticon.]` The story you relate is wonderful, and your sufferings have been great: I will order you some mixtus, `[A composition of which wine was a principal ingredient.]` and direct a second supper to be served up for you in the misericorde." `[The misirecorde, or hall of indulgence, was placed just outside of the other building, so that the monks could declare that it was not within the walls of their convent. Here, consequently, they were not subjected to the same strict rules as in the refectory, such as silence during meals, &c.]`

From Ryde we proceeded to Newport on the top of the coach. The first object that met our view as we drove into the town was our friend, Ragged Jack, lounging up and down the street, with his hands in his pockets, waiting the arrival of the coach, to which he acted as cad. When he descried his old patron, Mr. Winterblossom, he pulled his hands out of his pocket, lugged off his hat, and ran to assist the antiquary to descend, taking one of his feet in his hand, and placing it here, and another there, and then offering his arm to land him on the ground.

"Anything else besides the pockmanty, sir?"

"Only a small bag."

As soon as Jack had secured to himself the job of getting the luggage, he returned with them to the antiquary.

"Lor' ! sir; I am so glad to see your honour again. I have often thought of you while you was away. I never expected that you would have come back to the Isle of Wight again. And, how well your honour's looking, and I am right glad to see it."

"I understand," said the antiquary, slipping a shilling into his hand.

"No, sir; 'tisn't the shilling that I was fishing for then," said Jack, looking at the coin that he held in his open hand, and then up in the antiquary's face. "I should be heartily glad to see your honour again, if I never hoped to get another shilling from you. There's many a gentleman chucks me a shilling, but they seldom speaks a kind word to me, as your honour does. And there's Mr. Elder, too, and God bless him!" said he, pocketing the antiquary's shilling, and came to see whether he could do anything for me.

We were soon comfortably settled again in our old quarters; and Jack, as soon as he had deposited our luggage, sauntered up and down the street, whistling "Cherry Ripe!" but taking care not to lose sight of our door.

At length we sallied forth to visit Carisbrook Castle, which the antiquary's sudden departure from the island had prevented us from exploring last year. The moment we got into the street. Jack (I never could make out how) immediately guessed our intention.

"If you are going to Carisbrook, sir, I know the history of every stone in the castle."

"You may come with us, then."

As we walked along I most unexpectedly fell in with an old Oxford friend of mine. He was now performing the part of a private tutor, and had come down to the Isle of Wight with two pupils, to cram them (as the Oxford slang goes) for their degree. I introduced him immediately to Mr. Winterblossom, whom he said he had known well by reputation before, though he never had had the pleasure of meeting him. They were walking up to the castle too, so we joined parties. As we passed under the portcullis, the antiquary drew himself up with a proud feeling of patriotism. "Now we are indeed on classic ground. Here Vespasian fixed his fortified camp to overawe the island, after his bloody victory on Arreton Down. Here was King Witgar buried, from whom it anciently received its name, — for the Saxons called it Witgaresburg. He formed it into a Saxon fortress. Here afterwards reigned King Stuff, sole monarch of the island. It was somewhere here, probably, that he caused, his six prisoners to be burnt alive, to deter other adventurers from invading his beautiful island.

"Upon these Roman and Saxon foundations, soon after the Conquest, William Fitz-Osborne, Earl of Hereford, built his Norman fortress, and extended the area of the fortifications. Through these is the tilt-yard, where the tournaments and trials by combat were held, — where Isabella de Fortibus, the lady of the Isle of Wight, so celebrated in its local history, graced the splendid tournaments with her presence. The towers between which we passed are of the time of Edward the Fourth. See, the very wooden gate itself remains. The terror of the Spanish armada caused the castle to be surrounded with more effective fortifications in the reign of Elizabeth. And, look! — look at the ruins here on the left: there was the unfortunate Charles confined. That is said to be the very window through which he vainly attempted to escape. And here, young man," said he patting one of the Oxonians on the back, "on the right is the Castle Chapel; it is dedicated to the Popish idol or saint that presided over youth and scholars."
