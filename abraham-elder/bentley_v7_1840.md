THE WISHING WELL,

ISLE OF WIGHT. BY ABRAHAM ELDER, ESQ.

IN answer to our inquiry respecting the Wishing Well, Captain Nosered gave us the following account of it.

"The Wishing Well is a small spring of water that runs on the edge of the brow of the very steep hill that looks over the Undercliff, a little to the eastward of Ventnor. The superstition respecting it is, that if a person walks quite straight up to it from the low ground beneath without once looking behind him, and then drinks of the water, he will have any three wishes that he makes granted to him.

"It is, however, a feat not often performed. In the first place, the ascent is extremely steep, and the grass very slippery; and, although falling down does not forfeit the privileges of the water-drinker, yet should he fall, it would be very difficult to avoid looking behind. For, even if the person should not happen to turn partly round in his fall, he will be very apt to forget himself for a moment, and look at the sea and the country beneath. I do not know why it is; but while resting during an ascent of a steep road we have always a natural, and as it were, instinctive inclination to turn round; which, as I before observed, is in the present instance destructive of future prospects. Supposing all these accidents and inclinations surmounted, and the brow of the hill reached, ascending in a straight line, without inclining to the right or left, or looking round, the chances are greatly against coming exactly upon the little spring; and, if you find yourself upon one side of it, it is clear that you cannot get to it without turning, which, as I observed before, forfeits the right you would otherwise possess of having your three wishes accomplished.

"Since I have been an inhabitant of Violet Cottage," continued Captain Nosered, "I have not heard that any one has gone through the ceremony so exactly as to have obtained his three wishes."

"But, then, you should bear in mind, sir," observed the Antiquary, "that the spot is so frequented by strangers visiting the island, who are here to-day and gone to-morrow, that the thing might have happened over and over again without its having of necessity come to your knowledge."

"Your observation, Mr. Winterblossom, is a very correct one. For instance, when I was first married to my dear Florilla," (here Mrs. Nosered gave a smile of approbation,) "we took a honeymooning tour round the Isle of Wight. Did not we, love?" (here another smile and a nod.) "Well, when we got to Ventnor, where we drank tea and slept, we determined to visit the Wishing Well the next day after breakfast, and to wish for a boy," (here Mrs. Nosered put her hand before her face, and turned a little on one side, to look as if she was blushing.) "Well, after breakfast we started, and soon arrived at the bottom of the Wishing Hill; but, alas! it was far too steep for Florilla's delicate limbs, (she was a large, fat, red-faced woman, at the time the Captain related to us this story,) "so I was obliged to leave her at the bottom of the hill, and see what I could do for the family by going up to the spring, and drinking and wishing by myself. I was wonderfully successful in the ascent. I never looked once behind me; though Florilla in all her charms was seated at the bottom of the hill, smiling probably, and looking up towards me. Well, sir, I came straight upon tlie well at the top of the hill; I took some of the water up in the hollow of my hand; drank it; I then sat down, and wished for a boy. No boy came, however, — as the saying goes — in the due course of time. About two years afterwards, indeed, we had a little girl. —Jane, my dear, give Mr. Winterblossom a little more sugar in his tea. That's her, sir. Why it did not turn out right I cannot tell. Perhaps there is no real virtue in the well. Perhaps I failed in some small particular. But, somehow or other, it often strikes me, that if Florilla could have managed to have got to the top of the hill, and we had there drunk and wished together, it might have been otherwise."

Here Jane presented the Antiquary with a cup of tea, and Mrs. Nosered carried one to her husband, and, under pretence of whispering something into his ear, she gave him a little small kiss upon his left cheek; I suppose to thank him for calling her "dear," and talking of her charms before company, — which is more than any wife has strictly a right to expect. I was not, however, forgotten in this amiable distribution of tea; for the younger daughter, Charlotte, brought me my cup. Charlotte was, indeed, really beautiful. She had a small elegant nose — not looking downwards — which I admire above all things. Her light brown curls hanging down in long ringlets, and the ends of these silken tendrils resting upon her delicate and white bust — for she wore a low gown, being dressed for the evening. Heaven and earth! what would I have given for her to have whispered something into my ear after the manner of her mother. But, to return to my story. We sipped our tea, and stirred it, and then sipped again, Florilla looking complacently upon her husband; the Antiquary watching Jane as she spread and sliced the bread and butter; while I was feasting my eyes upon the beauty of the sweet, dear, Charlotte Nosered.

After the Antiquary had finished his tea, he continued knocking his spoon backwards and forwards in his empty cup — in deep meditation, doubtless, for he was deaf to frequent invitations to another cup. At length he turned to Captain Nosered, and said,

"I think you observed, that when you got to the top of the hill you tasted the water, — and then sat down, — and then wished for a boy?"

"Just so."

"Pray did you turn yourself round when you sat down?"

"Undoubtedly I did. The hill is so steep that if I had sat down the other way, I should probably have rolled head over heels down to the bottom of the hill."

The Antiquary made no answer, but gave a significant nod, and then changed the conversation by requesting Mrs. Nosered to supply him with another cup of tea.

At length I ventured to put in my word, and I said to the Captain,

"Then, sir, if I understand you rightly, you have tried the well yourself, and it has failed; and you have never heard of anybody else who has been more successful; although, of course, as Mr. Winterblossom well observed, the thing might have happened without its having of necessity come to your knowledge."

"You have quite misunderstood me, Mr. Elder," said he; "what I stated was, that I was not aware that anybody had obtained his three wishes since I had been a resident in Violet Cottage. There is, however, a man living close by, who a few years before I came to reside here drank of the wonderful well without making any fatal mistake, and had his three wishes all granted to him in due form. Shall I go out with you in search of the man, or shall I tell you the story my own way. I am quite at your service, whichever you choose."

Here the Antiquary and myself put our heads together in consultation.

"The Captain tells a story well," said the Antiquary.

"That he does," said I. "Besides the man may be a blockhead; which would destroy the romance of the thing. Besides, he will require about half-a-crown for his story; and, besides, I think it is going to rain."

The fact was, that I thought the society of Captain Nosered's family would be more agreeable than that of the man of the Wishing Well. So the Antiquary acquainted Captain Nosered that we should much prefer hearing the story in his own words.

Captain Nosered began as follows:—

THE STORY OF THE WISHING WELL

"John Chaw, the hero of my tale, at the time of his celebrated visit to the Wishing Well, was about twenty-two years of age. He was a labourer in the employ of Joseph Bull, a farmer, who lived not very distant from this place. John looked after his cows, and occasionally drove his waggon: but, having heard a number of curious stories about the Wishing Well, he determined to visit it, and see whether he could not, by wishing, better his condition. It was a smart walk from Farmer Bull's, and he had very little time to spare from his business; so he started a little before his breakfast-time, carrying his breakfast with him in his pocket. When he got to the Undercliff below the hill, he looked out for the tuft of grass that marks where the little spring oozes out from the brow above. He marked well the direction in which it lay, and walked straight for it. He never looked back; and he never turned at all to the right or the left all the way up. He then took some of the water up in the hollow of his hand, and said, "I wish as I was richer than any man in the Isle of Wight, and so here goes." He then drank some water. He then repeated his wish. After which he laid himself down upon the grass to rest himself a little, for the weather was very hot. Presently the hill, the Undercliff, the sea, and the sky, faded gradually from his sight, and he seemed to be shrouded in a kind of grey mist. At length he thought that he could trace the figure of an old woman in a loose grey cloak, standing with her arms extended over him. In her right hand she held a long, thin, straight, white stick. The figure got plainer and plainer, till her form had become quite distinct, when she said to him,

"'What's your wish, sir?'

"'Why,' said John Chaw, 'I wish as I was richer than any man in the Isle of Wight — that's what I wish.'

"The old woman answered, 'Very well,' and then touched his forehead with the end of her stick. 'Any other wish?' said she.

"'Nothing else at present,' said John Chaw. 'I should like that wish to soak in a little first.'

"'As you please, sir,' said the old woman, and her form gradually got fainter and fainter, till at length it disappeared altogether. The mist began to clear away, and John Chaw saw again the Wishing Well beside which he had laid down, the Undercliff, the sea, and the sky. So he got up, and walked down the hill, wondering all the while whether the old woman meant really to give him any money or not. However he did not go straight down, but took an easier way, which led him into the path that leads from Ventnor to the rock that is called the Pulpit Stone. Here he met with an elderly gentleman, who had apparently been taking a stroll to the Pulpit Stone, and was returning to Ventnor. He followed the old gentleman for about a hundred yards or so, when the latter suddenly appeared to be taken very ill, for he tottered a little, and then sat down on the grass by the side of the hill. John Chaw went up to him, and asked him 'whether he found himself unwell?' John Chaw offered to assist him home; which offer was accepted, and they went home to the old gentleman's lodging at Ventnor. Mr. Ballicalli was the old gentleman's name, and he took a great fancy to our hero, John, and he asked him to stay with him, and take care of him. The next day he said to him, 'Mr. Chaw, I feel that I have not many days more to live. I have spent the greater part of my life in India, and I have got no friends and few relations in England, and those few I do not like. I have taken rather a fancy to you, and, for want of a better, I intend to make you my heir.'

"'I hope you will live many a long day, yet,' said John Chaw, wishing to appear civil.

"So Mr. Ballicalli wrote to his lawyer in London, saying that he felt himself but poorly, and that Mr. Chaw was to be his heir; and, for fear of accidents in the mean time, he sent for a lawyer from Newport to make his will. The will was made, and Mr. Ballicalli died. And John Chaw, in compliance with the old gentleman's request, became Mr. Ballicalli Chaw. A day or two afterwards down came the lawyer from London, an elderly man in a brown wig, with black short gaiters, and acquainted Mr. Ballicalli Chaw that he was now the proprietor of a large house and fine park in Northumberland.

"Off goes John Chaw to Northumberland, and arrives safely at his great house. Lots of footmen to wait upon him, in blue coats and red small-clothes. John Chaw was as happy as the day was long. He had porter and purl, and beans and bacon for breakfast; got drunk regularly after dinner, and smoked his pipe in the evening. Many jolly companions visited him, and partook of his good cheer. Many of the squires in the neighbourhood called upon him, and almost everybody called him 'sir.' But, what pleased him most was, that Lord Thingummy, and his sister, Lady Kitty Thingummy, called upon him, and told him that they had the greatest pleasure imaginable in making his acquaintance. His Lordship told him that there was only one thing wanting to make Mr. Ballicalli Chaw completely genteel, — that was, marrying a lady of rank: and after a little while he went so far as to hint that Lady Kitty was very much prepossessed with his personal appearance and amiable manner. The upshot of all this was, that shortly after Mr. Ballicalli Chaw was married to Lady Kitty Thingummy, on condition, however, of his dropping the name of Chaw, which she did not consider sufficiently genteel.

"Here commenced our hero's misfortunes. In the first place, Lady Kitty, although of a high family, was extremely ugly, squinted, was very proud, and had the temper of a devil.

"John was obliged to cut all his merry companions, because they were vulgar. He was obliged to give up his porter and purl, and beans and bacon for breakfast, because they were vulgar. Getting drunk upon ale at dinner was vulgar, and John did not like wine. Smoking of an evening was the vulgarist thing that ever was heard of. John's great delight in former days used to be playing at skittles for a pot of beer: but skittles, he was told were, if possible, still more vulgar than clay pipes. Besides, he had the greatest difficulty in finding people to play with. Lady Kitty would not hear of his playing with the footman. This he thought the hardest thing of any; for, 'what are footmen for?' he would argue, 'if it is not to please their master?' However, the thing was pronounced to be vulgar, and so there was an end of it. He might, however, have a billiard table, if he pleased, and so he immediately ordered one. But this did not help him a bit; for, who was there to play with him? Unfortunately for John also, Lady Kitty's relations were even more proud than she was herself. She cut all John's friends and relations, because they were vulgar; and her relations cut Lady Kitty Ballicalli, because Mr. Ballicalli was so vulgar. Thus, between the pride of Lady Kitty and Lady Kitty's relations, John hardly could find anybody to speak to.

"Day after day he used to walk about his great park by himself, staring at the old oak trees and the deer, without knowing what to do with himself. Even in this, however, he was sometimes interfered with; for walking (or, at any rate, walking much) was vulgar. Two or three days a-week he used to drive with his wife, in their coach-and-four, along the turnpike-road, to the market-town and back; more for the purpose of showing off their grandeur, than for anything that they had to do there.

"This rumbling along in a carriage, instead of taking his natural and wholesome exercise on foot, as he used to do, went sorely against the grain with the unfortunate Mr. Ballicalli.

"Once or twice he seriously thought of rebelling, and throwing his gentility overboard altogether, and living comfortably and merrily with his merry vulgar companions again. But notwithstanding that he had what he called a successful scrimmage now and then, the influence of the wife in the end always prevailed. For instance, once he swore he *would*, and he actually *did*, go down to the village pot-house, and have a game at skittles: and he made all the folks that he found there as drunk as fiddlers, into the bargain. Such a life, however, he led for a fortnight afterwards, that he never showed fight upon that subject again. John Ballicalli began to think that a person may be very rich, and very genteel, and yet not be very happy, after all. In short, three months had hardly elapsed before he had made up his mind that he had not gained anything by his change of circumstances.

"One night he was lying tossing about in bed, bewailing his unfortunate condition. 'I just wish,' said he to himself, as he turned over to the other side, 'that I was back at the Wishing Well again, plain John Chaw, servant to Farmer Bull.' You will observe that he turned over as he wished this. Well, instead of resting his other side comfortably upon the feather bed, he turned over, and over, and over, very quickly, upon something very hard. This awoke him. When he opened his eyes he found himself rolling over and over down the very steep pitch below the Wishing Well. He was very much frightened, for he thought that he should be knocked to pieces long before he got to the bottom of the hill. He said to himself, 'I only wish that I may get safely to the bottom of the hill.' While he was wishing this he gradually got his legs before him, and, in consequence, he did not roll over any more, but slid gradually down the steeper part of the hill, and arrived safe and sound at the bottom of it.

"John was now more puzzled than ever he was in his life before. How in the world did he get from Ballicalli Park, in Northumberland, to the Wishing Well at Ventnor, without his recollecting anything about the journey?' But, then, to be sure, the rolling over and over had, as he expressed himself, 'put his head in such a whirr that he was so giddy he could hardly stand, and that probably put the recollection of the journey out of his head. He thought, however, that probably he should find both his carriage and his wife waiting for him at the hotel.'

"He walked down to the hotel, and inquired of the waiter whether Lady Kitty Ballicalli was within? The waiter had never heard of the name.

"'Is Mr. Ballicalli's carriage here?'

"'Whose carriage? asked the hostler, who was standing by.

"'My carriage,' said John, drawing himself up, for he was rather offended at the hostler's familiar tone.

"'Your carriage, Jack Chaw!' shouted the hostler in a loud fit of laughter. 'So you have been a-losing Farmer Bull's waggon and team; I would not be in your shoes for summut!'

"John now walked down to the cottage, where he used to live with his mother and sister before he grew rich; in short, he was so puzzled that he did not know where else to go to. At first he thought to himself, 'perhaps they will be a little huffy at first, and think that I have not used them well in not asking them to Ballicalli Park, and making fine ladies of them. But, when I explain it all to them, and how particular Lady Kitty is, they must at once see that this would have been altogether out of the question. Then I did send them a twenty pound note now and then, which Lady Kitty said was all that persons in their rank of life could possibly require.'

"John then went on to think that they would not canvass his conduct so closely, but would be overpowered by the honour of a visit from the rich Mr. Ballicalli, of Ballicalli Park, in the County of Northumberland. When he came to the cottage his mother was standing looking out of the door.

"'Ods boddykins!' said she, 'John, where in the name of goodness have you been all this blessed day? Farmer Bull has been kicking up such a rumpus about you. Horses and cows not tended to, and the pigs not fed. Farmer Bull actually fed the pigs himself, as Billy was not in the way either. It's a pretty go, indeed, to put your breakfast in your pocket and walk off nobody knows where, instead of coming comfortably home at meal-times.' Here she stopped to take breath, and John had a capital opportunity of putting in a word for himself; but he was quite taken aback by this unexpected attack. In short, it altogether bothered him. However, before his mother started again with the second part of her lecture, he observed that he did not understand what she meant by saying that he had been away the whole day, when she must have known as well as he did that he had not been in the Isle of Wight for at least three months before.

"'What do you mean, John?' said mother and sister both together.

"'Why, I just mean this,' he said, 'that I have been spending my time for the last three months at Ballicalli Park, in the county of Northumberland, living like a gentleman; and I will tell you what, mother, riding in a carriage ain't such very great fun, after all, when one begins to be a little accustomed to it. I dare say, now, you are angry at my not having taken you to Ballicalli Park, or sent you more money; but I should think,' added he, in a kind of patronising tone, 'a twenty pound note every now and then, is not altogether to be sneezed at? And, how are you all at home? Sister Sally, I see, is looking just as blooming as when I left her three months ago. And, how are the rheumatics, mother? — better, I hope.'

"His mother, however, instead of answering his kind inquiries about her rheumatics, shrugged up her shoulders and looked at Sally, and then exclaimed, 'The boy is gone stark mad! I fear he has not got wit enough left him to look after the team, or see to the cows, or even, I dare say, feed the pigs.' She then, like a thoughtful, careful mother, trotted off to Farmer Bull, to try to make her son's peace with him. 'Her son,' she said, had been taken very ill, in a sort of a fit like, and though he was better, she did not think that he was quite right in his head again. She hoped, however, that he would be able to get to his work again in the morning.

"John did get to his work again the next day, and went on as steadily as ever. He talked, to be sure, a good deal about Ballicalli Park, and Lady Kitty, for the first ten days; but he got so laughed at and quizzed that he soon let the subject drop altogether. And so it remained untalked of, and almost forgotten by everybody but himself, till these last few years, since the number of visitors coming to Ventnor has so greatly increased.

"It struck John one day, observing what numbers of people walked up the hill to see the Wishing Well, that his story occasionally told to a gaping stranger, might turn to some account; and many a shilling, I believe, it has brought him. Stories, my dear sir, as I suppose you must be aware, like wine and friends, improve by keeping. Not that I mean to say that there is one single particle of this tale, in its latest and most improved version, that John Chaw does not himself most implicitly believe to have happened.

"What appears to John to be the most extraordinary part of the history is the way in which the fairy accomplished his second wish, of making him plain John Chaw again, Farmer Bull's servant, and the wonderful manner in which she contrived to snip off three whole months out of his past life, so that not a trace of their existence remained. For nobody could ever persuade him that he had not been for three months Mr. Ballicalli Chaw, of Ballicalli Park, in the county of Northumberland, and he never would marry for fear of those three months of his life being rediscovered, and Lady Kitty Ballicalli prosecuting him for bigamy.

KING JOHN.

A LEGEND OF THE ISLE OF WIGHT.

IN the year A.D. 1215, the inhabitants of the few cottages that were at that time scattered along the banks of Whippingham Creek, were thrown into a state of great alarm by the arrival of four large vessels. Most of them fled away, and those that were unable to escape were still more dismayed to hear the chiefs of these intruders and their armed followers conversing together in a foreign language. They made no doubt but that it was another invasion of the Danes, for which they knew the island to be altogether unprepared, as they had been free from their inroads ever since the Conquest.

The Danes, whenever they came, burnt and destroyed whatever they found. The present visitors, however, acted differently. Instead of destroying anything, after turning the inhabitants out, they took possession of the cottages, and set to work to make them as comfortable as they could for their own residence; keeping, however, a few of the natives to slave for them in fetching wood and water, under the threat of the utter destruction of their property when they went away.

The strangers, however, did not appear to have the slightest intentions of leaving their present quarters again, but seemed to be preparing to make it their permanent abode; for all that evening men were employed disembarking deer's hides and costly furs, broad pieces of woollen cloth, cooking vessels of all kinds, huge piles of dried venison and hams, together with a number of casks of wine. They were also surprised to see disembark a quantity of most costly armour, such as only the nobility or the most wealthy knights were able to afford.

One of the poor fishermen, who had been thus unceremoniously dispossessed of his dwelling, ventured to hint to the person who seemed the chief of the strangers, and was almost the only one that appeared to be English, that if they intended to make a long stay in the island, there were many fairer and more convenient houses to which he would be happy to conduct them.

"Ha!" said the chief, with an air of offended dignity. "Let me give you this advice, — keep your prattling tongue quiet, and take no notice of what you see or hear, or —" finishing his sentence by signs, putting his forefinger and thumb round his neck, and then pointing up to a large bough of an oak tree that was spreading over their heads. "And now it strikes me," he continued, "that it would not be amiss just to hang one churl at starting; it would make the remainder more respectful and attentive. Here, De Mark, send Gigo here with half a dozen of his men and a halter."

When they had come, he made a sign with his finger, and in an instant one end of the rope was thrown over the bough of the tree, and the other tied in a running noose round the poor fisherman's neck.

"Shall we lift him?" said Gigo, turning to his master to see whether he had changed his mind.

"Lift away," said the chief, looking on with listless indifference.

Gigo's assistants quickly hauled upon the loose end of the rope, and the unfortunate man was soon swinging in the air. He struggled hard, clasping the rope above his head with both his hands, which they had not thought worth the trouble of tying behind him.

"He is a long time dying, my lord. Shall I lower him a little, and take a pull at his legs?"

"No, no; let him enjoy the liberty of kicking as long as he likes." His struggles presently got less strong, and he turned black in the face. "You may lower him down now, Gigo, and throw the carcass away."

"He is hardly dead yet, my Lord. Your Grace must not blame me if he should recover."

"Oh, for the matter of that, I do not care if he does. I only did it for a joke. But here comes the Templar. Well, Anner, what news from Hugh de Boves?"

"May it please your Grace, I had letters from him five days since; but I had some difficulty in tracing your Grace's movements. I sought you at the castle; but old De Vernon said that he had received no tidings of you. I think, nevertheless, that he is aware of your arrival here; for, upon being questioned, he acknowledged that he had heard of the arrival of certain strangers in the island."

"It was De Malleone's advice," replied the chief, "that we should not trust our royal self within the walls of Carrisbrook. De Vernon is ill affected towards us. His castle is strong, and rebellion walks abroad in the noonday."

Thus spoke King John, for the chief was none other; and De Malleone added,

"Although De Vernon's grandson is a hostage at Windsor, still, as the welfare of the realm hangs upon our Sovereign's life, we would not that anything should be unnecessarily risked."

Not all the hypocrisy of the Templar and respect for the royal presence could prevent a slight curl of contempt from being visible on his upper lip.

The King, however, marked it not, but asked, "What were the tidings from Hugh de Boves?"

"He writes, that when he showed your signet, vast numbers flocked to his standard from Poictou, Gascony, Lou vain, Brabant, and Flanders, and that in a week or two at the latest he will sail for Dover with a powerful host. The time will shortly come when the Barons will be able no longer to boast that they made their King a cipher, the sovereign of no dominions, and a slave to his subjects. But your Grace is ill accommodated here. Shall I summon De Vernon into the royal presence, and tax the Isle of Wight to support its royal guest in a befitting manner?"

"That would be rash, Sir Templar," said de Malleone. "Should our presence here make much stir, we might draw the Runnemede Barons upon us before our scheme is ripe. If De Vernon suspects who the strangers are that have sought refuge in his island, he must be kept silent by threats of vengeance."

"Ah," said the King's jester, who stood by, "tell him the joke we played off upon one of his retainers for unnecessarily putting in his word."

"Peace, fool!" said the King, perhaps a little ashamed of what he had done. "Sir Templar, I will intrust you with an embassy to De Vernon. Go and hint to him about the advantages of secrecy in all affairs connected with the King. Speak of those here as friends of the King. The King himself, mind you, is still at Windsor. On no account give him the slightest cause to suspect that he is any nearer him than that."

"I will execute your Grace's order," said the Templar; "and if it is your pleasure to let me take twenty of your men with me, I will surprise his castle, and put it out of his power to tell tales to any one."

"Act as I direct you, Sir Anner. It is absolutely necessary to the success of our future expedition that our residence here should not be noised abroad. Our sojourn here must be quiet, and perfectly peaceful."

"May it please your Grace," replied the Templar, "I am sorely puzzled to guess where we are to raise our supplies from, if the royal authority is altogether to be hidden in its scabbard. You would hardly like to hear of your caterers paying toll to the Earl of the Isle of Wight for leave to purchase bacon and long-cail in his market of Carisbrook."

"No, no," said a number of voices together; "that cannot be."

"It will never do," said Philip de Mark, "for the King of England, like a greasy burgher, to send his servants to market to buy salt beef and greens. I see a way to raise our supplies by the King's authority, without betraying his presence in the island. Let us not prey close round home like a mangy wolf; but get into our ships occasionally, and go out to sea and rummage the cargoes of the wealthy merchants, as they sail backwards and forewards to Southampton."

"Well contrived, De Mark. You are our best counsellor when we get into difficulties," said the King.

Day after day the King and his attendants spent their time in feasting and drinking deep. Their only other occupation was walking along the sea shore, throwing stones into the water, or practising with their cross-bows at the gulls. Day after day passed, and still no farther intelligence from Hugh de Boves. They did not dare to go much inland, or move far from the secluded spot in which they had established themselves, for fear of exciting attention, and making their residence known; for should the English Barons discover the villainous scheme of their King, who was preparing to invade and lay waste his own kingdom of England with an army of foreign mercenaries, his life would not have been safe.

The King himself would probably have submitted to the conditions of the Magna Charta, had it not been expressly stipulated in it that he should dismiss his Flemish knights, with whom he constantly surrounded his person. One of the clauses went so far as to banish by name several knights, most of them Flemings, who were his chief favourites and counsellors. These were the persons with whom we find him attended in the Isle of Wight. They urged him on to stir up a war against the Barons, by constantly holding up before his eyes the degradation that he had undergone at Runnemede.

"Do not suffer yourself," said they, "to be trampled under foot by your own subjects, and to be made a thing of nought, and a jest in your own kingdom."

Urged on by these taunts, he had intrusted Hugh de Boves and others to collect an .army on the Continent for the invasion of England. They were directed not only to bring with them an army, but any number of women and children, to people the counties of Norfolk and Suffolk, which he intended to lay waste. He had sent also to the Pope, offering to deliver up his kingdom to him, and hold it under him as his vassal, if his Holiness would give him the assistance and sanction of his name. This was the posture of affairs at the time of which this story treats; hence the strict seclusion in which the King thought it necessary to keep, until he obtained assistance from abroad.

In the course of time, the supplies that they had brought with them began to run short, notwithstanding that every now and then one of the knights or archers shot a deer in the surrounding wood, and that some supplies were daily sent in from the manor of Kerne, which at that time belonged to the Knights Templar.

"May it please your Grace," said De Mark one day, "our time hangs heavy upon our hands. Our provisions are running short, and our wine will be quite out to-night. A pretty bevy of merchantmen left Southampton this morning; the wind has quite fallen, so that they will make but little way. We should soon work up to them with our long oars."

"I wonder how they are manned and armed?" said the King.

"I know them well," answered De Mark; "they carry few arms, and scarcely men enough to tend the sails. In fact, they have little room for either, staggering as they are under a load of tin, salt beef, and hides. There was one of them seemed to be piled half way up the mast with wool-packs; and it's not at all improbable that we may trip up some foreign ship hither bound laden with wine."

"Well, then, you may give orders to prepare," said the King; "but mark, every knight and man at arms must be in disguise, and nothing but Flemish must be spoken whilst we are boarding them."

"Long live King John!" said those around, flourishing their caps in the air. "Long live the King, and success to our fishing!"

The news that the King had given orders to prepare for a marauding expedition spread like wild-fire through the royal colony. All was now activity; the ships launching, men at arms embarking, and pages running to and fro in search of spears, bucklers, and cross-bows.

They were soon at sea; but no royal pennon fluttered from the mast of King John's vessel. The only thing that distinguished that ship from the rest was the court-jester, who had got up to the top of the mast, as he said, to have the first sniff at the salt beef.

"Uncle John," said the fool, reaching his head down, "shall I tell you what joint of beef you would like to eat up best?"

"What is that?"

"A baron of beef," replied the jester; "but you do not know how to carve it when you have got it. The Saxons were the fellows for carving — those Saxons were clever fellows."

"Explain yourself, most mighty Wisdom," said the King.

"Why, look you, uncle, don't you remember how the Saxons invited all the British nobles to dinner at Stonehenge, and then sliced them up with their crooked knives, `[Seaxes, short slightly-curved swords used by the Saxons, from which it is supposed that the name of Saxon is derived.]` as if they had been ribs of beef? That was a rare go, uncle. Only think what a feast you might have made at Runnemede, if you had only had a little of my wit, uncle! But perhaps barons are not so easily caught now-a-days: they are getting up to trap. But it may be we will surprise them a little in a few days' time, hey, nuncle? And may be we'll surprise yon skipper, who appears to be sitting on a wool-pack eating his dinner."

"Peace, fool!" said the King.

"Ah, nuncle, it's all very well to talk of peace; but that is a very warlike man we are going to attack. Look at him. There he is cutting his bread and cheese with a knife as long as my arm! And what an irascible temperament he has! I can read it in the colour of his beard — his hair is as red as brick-dust. Those red men are terribly savage. Let's go and attack one of the other ships, and leave Master Rufus to finish his dinner."

They were now fast approaching the merchant ship that they were in chase of; and King John began to give his directions for boarding her. The men-at-arms lay concealed at the bottom of the King's vessel until the ships actually struck one another. They then sprang up, and leaped on board the red-whiskered man's ship.

The jester had been quite right in his estimate of the courage of the Captain; for, the moment he saw their intention of attacking him, he seized a short spear; and the rest of his crew appeared in arms at the same moment. It was not until the men at arms had sprung out of their concealment, and he saw the utter uselessness of defence, that he threw his weapon down again. While they were rummaging his vessel, however, he showed no signs of fear, but kept boldly demanding of them by what right and what authority they dared to pillage him? and threatening them with the vengeance of the King of England, whose subject he was.

King John's temper could ill brook this language. "Ha! seekest thou my authority?" said he. "Grigo, chop him down with an axe."

This cruel order was obeyed with alacrity, and the ship of the honest merchant was stained with its owner's life-blood. Gigo's assistants threw the carcase overboard, and the ship was allowed to proceed on her voyage.

King John's other two ships were equally successful, and they returned to their master laden with spoil.

The chiefs assembled in the royal vessel to hold a council what was to be done next. If they returned immediately to their old haunts they might be traced by some of those they had plundered. And, should that be the case, the barons with all their host might soon be upon them.

"Now if we sail round the outside of the island," said the Templar, "and return to our old quarters by the narrow strait to the west, it will then appear to these burghers that we are foreigners, and are going to cross the open sea."

"Does any one know the coast well?" asked the King, whose cruelty was alone equalled by his cowardice.

Upon inquiry it appeared that no one on board any of the ships had ever been round the outside of the island. But some of the sailors had heard reports that the voyage round that coast was full of perils. There was one place on the south-east of the island where, they had been told, that sometimes out of a smooth sea a long wave raises itself up like a wall, and, after rising to a great height, curls over upon the luckless mariner, and falls with the noise of thunder. Round the south coast there were said to be many other spots, where, while the wind was lulled, and the sea smooth everywhere else, a violent storm would be raging within its contracted limits. The waves rising up to a great height, and falling over in all directions, to the imminent danger of such vessels as were drawn within its limits by the strength of the tide, or by the magical influence of the water-demons who were the cause of all this hubbub in the sea. Water-kelpies had, indeed, occasionally been seen riding a-straddle on the white foaming crests of the waves, combing their long hair, or singing melancholy ballads in the pale moonlight,— for they were rarely or never seen in the daytime.

Although these magical storms generally occurred near the same spots, some of these places were farther out at sea, while others were close to the shore. In short, the sailing round the island appeared to be a perilous adventure, which it would be folly to attempt without the strongest necessity.

"Ah!" said the jester, "we should be like gudgeons, who, after catching a nice prey for themselves, get eaten up by the larger fishes. Just think now, uncle, of being boiled down into soup to make a dinner for the water-kelpies."

"But, if we go straight back," said De Maleone, "our retreat will be known to the burghers, and we shall be attacked in the morning by superior numbers, and your Grace will run imminent risk of being discovered, if a worse chance does not befal you; for the rebel Barons are in high favour at this moment with all classes, and your Grace's death would be a sure road to preferment."

"What think you, Sir Templar," asked the King, "of the voyage round the island? Is there any credit to be given to these strange stories of enchanted waves and water-kelpies."

"I should be deceiving your Grace if I was to say that I doubt them altogether. I have myself seen mariners, who have told me of the sights and sounds that they have witnessed as they sailed by night round the south coast of the Isle of Wight. Different coloured lights would be seen hovering along the shore, sometimes over the land, and sometimes over the sea. At one time a dismal moaning would be heard; at another the sound of beautiful music. Among the high cliffs I have also heard that there are deep caverns in which the sea enters, in one of which was once seen coiled up a sea-serpent of enormous length. For my own part, however, I think little of these things. I have seen much of life, and been in perils by land and sea; and I have ever found that supernatural terrors shrink into little or nothing upon a close inspection. My opinion is, that we should sail round the island, and so return to our former quarters. I think I might safely stake my honour as a knight that we shall meet with neither magical storms, Kelpies, nor sea-serpents."

"It's all very well, Sir Knight Priest," said the jester, who saw how the land lay with his royal master, — "it's all very well for you to talk in this manner, who can exorcise a kelpy with one hand, and cut his throat with another. Yet methinks your counsel is rather of the rashest; like the advice that the fish gave to his companions in the fryingpan, that they should all jump out of it into the fire."

"What thinks your Grace," said De Maleone, "of standing out to sea for a few hours, as if we were sailing to a foreign country, and slip back again to our old quarters in the dusk of the evening?"

"We have nothing else to choose," said the King, "that gives us any hope of safety."

The three ships, in consequence, stood out to sea, as if for the purpose of crossing the channel. There was very little wind, but a long rolling swell came from the eastward, which in the course of a little

ime began to produce unpleasant effects upon those on board, who had not been accustomed to the sea.

"Look at Sir Gigo there," said the jester; "his face is becoming the colour of parchment. How he opens and shuts his mouth like a dying oyster! It strikes me, uncle, that he must be a man of infinite wit."

"Why so?"

"I mean, judging from the good things that come out of his mouth."

"Foh!" said the King, "you have quite given my stomach a turn. I didn't feel unwell before."

"In that case," replied the jester, "I will take myself off to the farthest end of the ship. I would sooner pull a lion by the whiskers than jest with a King who feels sea-sick; and, as for holding my tongue, it is a thing that I have never been accustomed to."

After rolling about upon the long swell of the sea, with a hot sun over their heads, for the rest of the day, as evening began to close in they turned their vessels' heads towards the shore again; and about midnight they found themselves again in their old quarters. Here they found a messenger, who had been sent to the King from the Bishop of Worcester, the Lord Chancellor, and Hugh de Boves, who were still abroad, collecting troops for the invasion of England. Their letters stated that these foreign allies of King John were on the point of sailing for England: and the King was recommended to come to Dover without delay, to put himself at their head. The next day there was a strong east wind, which rendered the King's sailing from the Isle of Wight impracticable; and the King, to while away the time, was sauntering through the glades of the forest that fringes the creek of Whippingham, attended by his jester, the Templar, De Maleone, and Gigo, habited as usual in the dress of common sailors.

On turning a corner they came unawares upon a lady, who was sitting upon a fallen tree, caressing a large deer greyhound. She was tall, and delicately formed, and her dark tresses hung down in long ringlets upon her bosom. The King was much struck with her beauty and noble bearing; and, emboldened by the success that usually attends royal gallantries, at once familiarly placed himself by her side, and began a long string of idle and courtly compliments.

"Fairest lady, what a felicity it is for my admiring eyes to discover such a beautiful form inhabiting so savage a forest. How would all the beauties of the court shrink into comparative ugliness by the side of this lily of the island!"

The lady shrunk back, and tried to separate herself from him, but in vain; for the King still continued to intrude himself upon her.

"Who are you?" she said, "that thus unmannerly force yourself upon my society. If you are what your dress represents you to be, you will, perhaps, show some respect to my rank, although you do not to my sex. Know that I am the daughter of a knight, and I seek not companions among those that are servile born."

"Gentle lady," he replied, "you would do me wrong were you to judge me by the dress that I now wear. I am not what I appear to be. My rank is as superior to that of a simple knight, as your station is to that of the meanest serf. Lady, I am the King." He watched her eye to see the effect that this sudden announcement of his royal station would have upon the mind of a country-bred girl. Great was his surprise to find that, instead of his disclosure working a change in his favour, she shrunk from him more than before, and uttered an exclamation of horror.

"No, no, no," she exclaimed, "I will never believe that. The King I know to be profligate, wicked, and cruel; but he never, never would have hung a poor, innocent, honest, industrious man, for a mere jest. Thank Heaven, however, he still lives. He was brought like a dead man to our house. I was his physician; and he lives to bless me. Oh, what an unfortunate being I am; after all this to fall myself into the power of such a———"

"Speak the word out, lady, fear not."

"Villain was the word, then," she replied, the colour mounting to her cheeks. "Isabel de Bosco fears you not. Let me pass on my way."

"Not so, sweet lady," said the King, taking hold of her gently by the arm. No sooner, however, had he touched her than the deerhound by her side gave a loud bark, and flew straight at the King's throat. The King let go her arm, and started back. The dog also checked his spring, and contented himself by warning the King of danger with a low threatening growl.

Presently a number of armed persons were seen advancing through the openings between the high oaks. The maiden clapped her hands to draw their attention, and then turning to the King, she added, "Now I am beyond your power; and, know further, it only rests with me to hang you on yon tree, as you hung poor honest Gurton. But, go your ways now, and mend your manners."

The King, who by no means liked the look of the tree that she pointed to, was not slack in following her advice. But, as he turned away with his companions, he muttered between his teeth, "By God's feet she shall not escape me thus. Am I to be made a laughing-stock of by a country maiden? Before we hoist our sails this night, she shall be my prize."

The supper was over in the old hall of Wotton. Sir Reginald de Bosco, its venerable proprietor, with his fair daughter, Isabel, had just received the lamp from their page, and were retiring to their private apartments. The retainers and visiters that crowded the lower part of the hall rose out of respect to the knight; but, before they had time to leave the hall a loud knocking was heard at the outer door. The seneschal went down with the porter to the entrance, and questioned the strangers through the wicket.

"Who knocks so loud, and disturbs the knight's family at so late an hour?"

"Messengers to Sir Reginald de Bosco from the Earl of the Isle of Wight," was the reply.

The bolts were immediately withdrawn, and the door thrown open. The old seneschal was thrown down, and trampled on by the crowd that rushed in, and the hall was filled with armed men.

Isabel gave a loud shriek. "That is he that called himself the King." She ran out by a side-door, and drew the bolts behind her.

"Give chase!" cried the chief of the intruders.

A number of men instantly ran up the hall, oversetting the stools and forms, passed the dais, and burst open with an axe the side-door by which Isabelle had retired.

The lady was presently dragged out again into the hall by Gigo and the Templar, and forced by them away from her father's house, followed by the remainder of the King's attendants. They had not, however, gone far from the building, when, as they passed through the wood, Gigo, who was holding one of the lady's arms, fell, pierced through by an arrow.

"That was a bold marksman," said the Templar, "who ventured to send his shaft so near the lady."

"I only did it for a joke," shouted a voice from behind a tree not many yards off; and, before this sentence was concluded another ar»row had scored the skin from off one of the ribs of the King. An inch difference in the aim, and it had reached his heart.

"Treason!" shouted the King. "Let go the maiden, and scour the wood. A purse of gold to whoever secures the villain."

The maiden was released, and made her escape; and the archer turned his knowledge of the ground to such advantage that they heard no more of him.

The next morning saw King John and his followers depart to attempt a scheme of higher import, and deeper villainy, in the prosecution of which he perished, and the curses of his subjects were heaped upon his grave.
