ISLAND LITERATURE: A GUIDE BOOK OF 1778.

Guide books of variable quality and numerous in quantity have been written on the Isle of Wight, and increasing popularity has been attended with a proportional increase of these useful companions. Among the first, and perhaps the earliest now existing, is the "View of the Isle of Wight," by John Sturch, published in 1778. Literature relating to the Island, whether historical, descriptive, or poetical, must always be of interest to many of its inhabitants. As far as the writer has been able to ascertain, no attempt has yet been made to form a complete list of books relating directly to the Island, and there can be no doubt that such a list, however imperfect, would of interest to many collectors as a nucleus for a fuller and more complete catalogue. At the end of this paper will be found a chronological list of books published before the beginning of this century, a copy of each of which may found in the Bodleian Library. It is hoped that any one who can add or amend the catalogue will give much assistance as he is able, for it would be well to make this list of earlier publications as complete as possible before dealing with the present century.

In 1778, then, John Sturch published at Goldsmith's, 24, Paternoster-row, a small book (12mo) entitled a "View of the Isle of Wight in four letters to a friend." This book seems to have attained some popularity, for a second edition was celled for, and in 1787 a third edition was published and sold by the author in Newport. Two more editions were issued, and the fifth was an octave, also published at Newport in 1794. Perhaps a slight account of the contents would be of interest, as the book is in epistolary form, and is not so much a historical sketch of the Island as an account of the state of the Wight at the end of the last century. In the preface to the third edition (1787), the author mentions with approbation the appearance of Worsley's History (1781), which was, he said, the first history of the Island he had ever seen. Fourteen years after this was written John Albin's "New, correct and much improveed History of the Isle of Wight," published at Newport, and in the same year (1795) the Rev. Richard Warner's "Military, Eccliesiastical, Civil, and Natural History" also first saw the light at Southampton. In 1796 the "Tour of the Isle of Wight," by Charles Tomkins, was publiahed. It is to be noticed that in his preface he mentions the existence of "several histories of the Island, some of which had become scarce." But before 1796 we know of only three histories and the poetical and guide books mentioned at the end of this paper. This sentence seems rather to infer that there were other histories prior to Warner, Albin, Worsley, of which we have no knowledge. Returning, however, to Sturch, we learn that Shanklin Chine and Steephill were even then much frequented by visitors, who often brought with them their luncheon. Communication with the mainland was fairly good, for besides vessels belonging to private owners there were three boats in the Government pay, called packet boats, which carried the mails every day (except Saturday and Monday) from the Island, and from the mainland every day Tuesday. As now, these packet-boats plied between Cowes and Southampton, Yarmouth and Lymington, Ryde, Cowes, and Portsmouth. Starch reckoned the number of houses at Newport at 550, most of them modern and well built. The Quakers had a chapel erected for their worship in Newport, but at this time it was disused aa none that community lived there. Cowes was in a flourishing condition and possessed a considerable trade. Carolina rice ships to the number of "30 or 50 annually" discharged from 22 to 35 thousand barrels of rice, which was "usually skreened, repacked, and shipped for Holland, Germany," (a) and other countries. Unfortunately at this time Cowes had to bear her share in the disastorus results of England's rupture with America, and from 1777 this trade was almost entirely lost. The princips productions of the Island were corn and wool, which "hardly one tenth was consumed by the inhabitants." The pasture for sheep was excellent; in connection with this Sturch refers to a tradition which acoounto for the number of hares then existing in the Island. "Any one," he says, "bringing over a hare got a sheep or lamb in exchange" (b). Foxes were unknown in the Island, which can hardly be said to be the case nowadays. There were no less than nine water mills within a mile of Newport, from whence the flour was exported to Irelimd and the west countries of England. Scarcely any of the wool grown was manufactured here, but was packed up and sent off to the north. Copperas stone was occasionally collected from the south shores and sent to London, where it was employed for the production of vitriol. White sand also was "dug out of the quarries near Yarmouth," and conveyed to London and Bristol for the use of glass manufacturers. Some of the inhabitants of Freshwater made a small living by catching birds and taking the eggs from over the cliff, which were procured by the usual method of running a stake firmly into the ground, attaching a rope, and then lowering a man gently over the cliff. After explaining this method. Sturch drily adds, "You will hardly suppose they stand in need of a royal patent to keep the trade to themselves." This little book throws an intaresting side light on the condition of the Island between 1778-94, and the simple and easy style in which it is written no doubt contributed in some degree to its evident popularity.

ISLAND LITERATURE. [Continued from the County Press of Dec. 17]

Before proceeding to deal with the books of this century, mention may be made of two or three earlier ones unnoticed in the last paper. The British Museum possesses an unpublished msnneeript of a short survey by a lieutenant of the military company at Norwich, written in August, 1635. At this time Jerome, Earl of Portland, was the Captain of the Wight. He had succeeded his father, Lord Weston, in 1634, and was shortly after himself deposed from his office by the Parliament on account of his allegiance to Charles I., though nominally on Popish grounds. This account of the Wight is written from a military standpoint, and Sir E. Dennis and Sir J. Oglander are mentioned as the lieutenants of a force of 2000 foot, with arms for 2000 more should occasion require. About the same time the "Antiquitatea Insulum Vectae," by Richard James, nephew of Dr. Thomas Jamas, of Newport, the first librarian of tbs Bodleian Library, was written, thougb this also has never been published, but has a place in the Bodleian Manuscripts. Richard James died in 1638. A short account of his remarkable life may be aaen in Nelson's Handbook to the Isle of Wight, by W. H. D. Adams, published in 1862.

In 1640 (?) Thomas Johnson, a native of Hull and honorary M.D. of Oxford, published his "Mercurius Botanicus" (unfortuaately omitted in the last paper), which was an account of a tour through Bristol, Southampton, the Isle of Wight, and Guildford. (I am unable to give the exact date or publisher of this work, I have not yet seen it, but perhaps this information can be supplied by some reader of thie paper.) The author of this work was killed on September 12th, 1644, at the siege of Basing House. Another unpublished MS., written by William Pavey in 1719, entitled "Church Notre in Hampshire and the Isle of Wight," is possessed by the British Museum. This writer has recorded many inscriptions on tombs, some of which are quoted by Adams in "The Garden Isle."

Before turning to the nineteenth century, it may be noticed that 1799 was the year in which the Rev. E. Kell, who was destined to throw so much light on Island history and antiquities, was born.

John Albin followed up his larger history of 1795 with a "Companion to the Isle of Wight," which immediately attained popularity, for a third edition was issued in 1802, and the ninth edition in 1823. It is interesting to note that both of Albin's works are published at Newport. Sharp, in 1736, published his book on the Isle of Wight (the earliest I know; probably in Newport), as did Sturch from the third edition, and the author of the description of a sail from Newport to Lymington, &c., 1794.

In 1816 Sir H. Englefield published his "Description of the Isle of Wight," perhaps the most important work sinces Worsley's in 1781. By no means the least valuable part of the book are the plates by W. and G. Cooke.

Respecting George Brannon's publications a few words must be said. His first edition of "Vectis Scenery" was publiwbed in 1820. For about the next 40 years from that date an edition was issued yearly, occasionally a new set of plates being introduced throughout, though more often a few new plates only were added to each edition. In 1859 George Brannon died, and after 1861 no new plates were issued. During his lifetime he published a considerable number of books, and it is unfortunate that no complete list of the dates of their various editions has been preserved. No one has more ably and fully depicted the beauties of our Island scenery.

Richmond, who has recorded the pathetic end of Little Jane, the Young Cottager, was born at Liverpool in 1772. In 1789 he went to Trinity College, Cambridge, and in 1797 he became rector of Brading and Yaverland and Bembridge. To the latter place he used to for the benefit of those who were unable to come to Brading, for Bembridge possessed no church. "The Young Cottager" was first published separately in 1818, and also embodied in the "Annals of the Poor." "The Dairyman's Daughter" (her real name was Wallbridge, and she lived at Arreton) exercised considerable influence, and was translated into several different languages. Legh Richmond afterwards accepted the living of Turvey, Bedfordshire. He died in 1827. Several of his works have been illustrated by George Brannon's plates.

I hope in my next paper to bring this imperfect list up to 1860, and then from that date up to the present time.

ISLAND LITERATURE.

Continued from *County Press*, February 11.

TO DO

We are well in the period when guide books were poured forth in ever increasing numbers; when every other visitor to the Island seemed to think it his or her duty to record their impressions either in prose or in verse. And the popularity of the Island is evidenced by the aueesas of many of thair records. ordinary raadsr they potsara little or attraction in their letterpress. A reoesusing feature however, of this class of book is that aaeii hat, nda, steal engravings or wood-cuts, which may make sa otherwise book of sores to the collector. A assail wood-cut eseoated with any degree a< noonracy often indicates witfcsileut some better then page of word-painting, the growth and rhangm in oar towns and even scenery, brought sboot during the last fifty T< Among»hs books published between 1840 and Hadis's History of the Island (incorporated his history of Hampshire) most rank high. The letter pram interesting, and the plates good. An engraving of Ryde shows perhaps better than any other how completely the old arafroumg* has been ohoagod by the modern Srelsanda. The "Wanderings in the Isle of Wight "(1446), written by the author of the Old Bee OapSnin," and published by the BeKgions Tract Homely, is carious little book, evidently intreded for children. Island beauties sradeeeribed to two children, plaatifoUy seasoned with moral lemons, and illustrated with small wood-cuts. In book 'whkh met wttfa during stay in the Wight. H. B.

The folk-lore of the Isle of Wight comprises many legends. An island story which somewhat resembles that of the pied piper of Hamelin who decoyed the rats and children away is sometimes told.

TO DO


THE PIED PIPER OF NEWTOWN

*To the Editor of the Isle of Wight County Press.*

Sir, —I think I can assure Mr. W. a Weeks that there is no foundation, legendary or otherwise, for Abraham Elder’s story of the Newtown Piper. To judge by its situation, Newtown would be no doubt a happy hunting ground for rats, both English and Hanoverian, though, unfortunately, I have found but few traces anywhere in the Isle of Wight of the English rat. The whole legend, including its adaptation, localisation, and publication, may be put down to the fertile brain of Abraham Elder. Mr. Weeks speaks of the "Tales and Legends of the Isle of Wight" by Abraham Elder, London, 1839. Abraham Elder produced in that year two issues of his "Tale and Legends." The first issue was a small book of 198 pages with only four illustrations, drawn, I conjecture, by Abraham Elder himself. The illustration for page 4 has the curious blunder of the number 116 being substituted for 4. This smaller issue is called on the title page "Part the first." This issue has a value of its own, as it contains as a frontispiece a view of the Needles, showing the original needle rock. This frontispiece may have been meant by Abraham Elder to be included amongst the legends of the Isle of Wight. In the same year came out the second issue of the "Tales and Legends." This issue is much larger volume, it contains 336 pages, with 14 large and 11 small woodcuts by Robert Cruikshank. The illustration of page 4 of the first issue is reproduced as a vignette on page 8 of this second issue, otherwise the 25 illustrations are entirely different from the illustrations of the first issue. Of this second issue a second edition appeared in 1843, but in no way differing from the first edition. I have tried to find out the real name of Abraham Elder. I have learned that he either was native of, or lived in, Shanklin and that to his parents he owed the name of Clayton, but I have not yet been able to find out what name was given him by his godfather and godmother. I should be much obliged to any of your readers who would give me this information. —Yours obediently, R.G. D. To the Editor of the Id* of Wiakt County Frees. Sir,—Seeing in your paper of the 9th inat. letter by Hr, W. Saif weeks, who wants to know if ever the Pied Piper was in existence at Newtown, I, as one of the oldest inbabitanta of the pjace, eon only say that the first I ever heard of his existence was in paper read by Mr. Oolenutt, of the Hampshire Field Club, on the occasion of the Club’s visit to Newtown tome time back. The address was recorded in the Cbunty Prctt. The part concerning the Pied Pier was follows: Newtown we have an example of the Pied Piper legend, and in the Island town of Francheville this itinerant musician seems to have created quits much dismay and root ion among its peaceable but money-loving inhabitants did on the occasion of his visit to Haaoelin. At this place the children are said to have bam lad down into the Solent, detail which I believe usually takes local turn in examples of this legend." It appears by this record that be did visit Newtown or Francheville, which will take you back to 1377, whan Newtown was known Francbeville. As to what became of him I cannot say. Probably, if got s;aking noise in the place at that period, the French most likely would take him as a spy in tbs garb of minstrel. There are but three families besides my own in modern Newtown who were in the place SO years ago, I have made inquiriea of them concerning the Fled Piper, and they know nothing of the legend. I have in my possession octagonal metal button, about the sine of penoy-p eoe, which was dug at Newtown, but whether it belonged the Pied Piper’s coat I cannot my. If this information, which I nave extracted from little work Historical 'rltsnings of Newtown," is of any use to your correspondent, be is welcome to it with my compliments.—lam. Sir, your obedient servant, J. H. Wooloab. Newtown, Dee. XL 1883. A NEWPORT CHEMISTS PROTEST. To (he Editor of tkt Idt of Wight County Prom. Sir.—On reading the report of the prooeedings of the Newport Town Council in yonr last week’s uaoe, I found to my gnat aurpnae that it has recently had samples of water analysed by Meaan. Allan and Banbury, of London. Now, Sir, rarely it is the duty our municipal authorities, especially in them days depression of trade, to get all nieimary work done locally tar possible. There are I believe four chemists in Newport possessing qualifications qU,J poMMsed by the proprietors of the firm "Allen and Hsabnry.’’ and I have no doubt that any one them would have been only too pleased to have done the work, had bran given the opportunity. Ae for m I can beer, local chemist was even approached on the matter; I know for certain that oaa was not, ha would certainly taen pleated to have undertaken it.

ABRAHAM ELDER.

To the Editor, Isle of Wight County Press. Sir,

In reply to the inquiry of your correspondent R.G.D., I can state that author of the "Tales and Legends of the Isle of Wight" was the late Hon. Augustus Moreton, M.P. for Gloucestershire, who wrote the book under the name of Abraham Elder when living with his uncle, Col. Moreton, about that time at Bembridge. —Yours truly. W.W.

ABRAHAM ELDER

*To the Editor of the Isle of Wight County Press.*

Sir,— Abraham Elder's "Tales and Legends of the Isle of Wight" contains a great deal of matter which has but little relation to, and which is by no means the natural product of, the Island, but which originated only in the fertile imagination of A. E., whose *real* name is shrouded in mystery, like the name of the builder of the pyramids. For years I have vainly endeavoured to discover it and still like Junius, *stat nominis umbra*. I do not think he was a native of the Island, but probably a visitor, or some one who had been resident for some time. I have heard the names of Clayton, Moreton, and others mentioned in connection with the tales, but nothing of satisfactory nature giving any real clue to the writer's identity. The second part of the "Tales and Legends" first appeared in the pages of *Bentley's Miscellany* in 1839 and 1840. I knew one of the earliest contributors to *Bentley*, and the last survivor of that brilliant circle of writers, a gentleman who was well acquainted with most of the contributors to the earlier volumes of the *Miscellany*, and through him I made inquiries few years ago of Bentley and Son to the real designation of A. Elder, but could obtain no reply, after much research. His identity was forgotten and remained unknown to his publishers. The first part of the tales, as your correspondent "R.G.D." observes, was published in 1839, with four plates in lithograph. Another issue was published in 1841, with plates by R. Cruickshank, engraved by the "gypsographic" process. In this volume the second part of the tales was first published as a book, and with the first part makes a volume in 12mo of 336 pages. A second edition appeared in 1843, and is simply reprint of the volume published in 1841. All the editions are now become scarce, the first especially.— I am, yours truly,

W. H. Long. 120, High-street, Portsmouth, December 22, 1893.

[Mr. Long's letter reached us too late for insertion in our last issue, in which, it will be remembered, it was asserted on the authority of Mr. W. W. Osborne that the author of the book in question was the Hon. A. Moreton.—ED. *I.W.C.P.*]

RANDOM JOTTINGS.

It may be of dome use to those of my readers who are making a list of notable Island books if I call their attention to a somewhat rare work, for the loan of which I am indebted to Mr. Roach Pittis, whose interest in local historical and antiquarian matters is well known. It is entitled "Tales and Legends of the Isle of Wight; with the adventures of the author in search of them." The name of the author is given as "Abraham Elder, Esq.", and the work (second edition) is dated 1843. In an introductory chapter the writer says: "Some apology is due to the public for presenting another book about the Isle of Wight to them. Its hills, its chines, and its underclitfs, the Needls Rocks and Alnm Bay, its hanging woods, and purling streams, and all its other ineffable beauties have again and again been described by pens far more romantic and sentimental than mine. Yet still there remains a path as yet untrodden. No one has hitherto attempted to collect into a volume the ancient tales and traditions of the Island." This is the task to which the author applies himself, and the result is a highly entertaining volume.

I should like to sketch the contents of this book, but regard for your space restrains me. Perhaps, if I am here, you will let me return to the diverting/ theme in your Christmas number! It must now suffice to say that, amongst many wonderful stories, here we have the tale of "The Pied Piper of Newtown," who freed the ancient town from a plague of rats, which had worked worse havoc even than the French. With much picturesque detail the history told of the ancient "borough of Woolverton," compared with which Bradiog is but a modern town, the "hermit's cave" and the "haunted wood" furnishing material for wondrons legends. The reader is let into the secrets of "Puck-pool" and "Puckaster," with their traditions of the tricksy sprite immortalised in "A Midsummer Night’s Dream." Here we learn a great deal never knew before about "King Stuff" and "Wulphere," sole monarchs of the Wight in days which are well-nigh lost in the mists of antiquity. Fully recounted is the legend relating to the miraculous manner in which Godshill church was built on the commanding elevation where it is now such a feature in the landscape, giving its name to the village, "though it is no nearer heaven than rest of the country!" We are taken in imagination to "The Queen’s Bower," in the neighbourhood of Shanklin, deriving its name from the circumstance that Isabella de Fortibus, the Lady of the Wight in the reign of Edward I, erected her hunting pavilion in that romantic spot. The commotion caused along the banks of "Whippingham Creek" by the arrival there of "four large vessels," in one of which was King John, is described, though the veracioosnees of this bit of history cannot be vouched for in every detail, as there was no *County Press* then to trustworthily record the wonderful goiogs-on in the Wight! Of course, Carisbrooke figures in the volume, as do St. Nicholas, and Quarr, and the "Wishing well," and the famous "Pillar of Mottiston," and the "Logan Stone" and "the giant of Chale," and many other places and things traditionally famous in the olden time. Bat 1 mast stop! It may be added that the letterpress is illustrated by some characteristic pictures by Robert Cruickshauk.

By the way, may I beg space just to say that reflections of a more serioas character sometimes occur to the mind of the author to whose work I have been referring. When at Brading he is impressed by the changes wrought by the conflict that is eternally going on between sea and land. "The spot where we now stand," he remarks to a companion, was at one time a deep sea, at another time it was land again, and then a freshwater lake; again, the sea, with its salt-water tribes, regained possession; again, here a high beach of shingle fought for ascendance, inch by inch, against the rolling waves; and then the land rose slowly and gradually above the level of the surrounding water, and became a residence for mushroom man. Fashion, and folly, and the love of money now reign where long ago fishes swam." Let us hope, Mr. Moraliaer, that some good and wise things reign also! "But," he goes on to observe, there is another thing, much more wonderful, relating to the Isle of Wight, which is, that the whole Island is gradually, though slowly and imperceptibly, sinking bodily again beneath the waves." This considerably amazed his friend, and lest the prospect should prove startling to some of my readers also, I would refer them for comfort to our distinguished Island geologist. Mr. G. W. Colenutt, who will assure them most positively that the Isle of Wight will last *their* time.

FROM THE CONTEMPORARY PRESS. CHRONICLE.—

APPOINTMENT OF MAGISTRATES.

THE DUKE OF WELLINGTON.—A good deal of surprise is expressed by several of our contemporaries at the intemperate language of the Duke of Wellington in characterising the late appointments of magistrates by the Lord Chancellor. There are so many good points in the Duke of Wellington, that it is always painful to us to speak of him in terms of reprehension. On the occasion in question he certainly forgot what was due to the Lord Chancellor, and betrayed a most suspicious soreness. Every man loves justice in the abstract, but there are not many persons who are fond of it when the sentence is against themselves. The Duke of Wellington might have admired the conduct of the Lord Chancellor, had it not unfortunately happened that it amounted to a reproof of his Grace, in his capacity of Lord-Lieutenant of Hampshire.

A Sunday paper (the Observer) remarks—" The illustrious duke put hypothetically some cases, in which the Lord Chancellor might wish, for political purposes, to include improper persons in the commission of the peace; but we have a strong suspicion that the cause of the noble duke's soreness is to be found in the consciousness that lie himself, as Lord Lieutenant of Hampshire, had objected to the insertion in the commission for that county of the name of such a gentleman as Mr. Augustus Moreton, Lord Ducie's son, and resident in the Isle of Wight, simply because Mr. Augustus Moreton was the Liberal member for Gloucestershire. Are we mistaken in adding that the illustrious duke did also object to the appointment of Mr. Oglander as a magistrate for that same county, because he too had upon him a taint of Reform principles ?"
