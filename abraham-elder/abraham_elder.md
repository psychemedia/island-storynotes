TALES AND LEGENDS OF THE ISLE OF WIGHT.

To the Editor of the Isle of Wight County Press. Sir,— In your last number you mention "The Tales and Legends of the Isle of Wight," written by my father under the name of Abraham Elder. As I am thinking of revising and republishing, I would be very pleased to get any legends or true smuggling stories connected with the Island that would add to the interest of the new edition.—Yours, &c. A. H. Macdonald Moreton. Bembridge, I.W.

FROM THE CONTEMPORARY PRESS. CHRONICLE.—

APPOINTMENT OF MAGISTRATES.

THE DUKE OF WELLINGTON.—A good deal of surprise is expressed by several of our contemporaries at the intemperate language of the Duke of Wellington in characterising the late appointments of magistrates by the Lord Chancellor. There are so many good points in the Duke of Wellington, that it is always painful to us to speak of him in terms of reprehension. On the occasion in question he certainly forgot what was due to the Lord Chancellor, and betrayed a most suspicious soreness. Every man loves justice in the abstract, but there are not many persons who are fond of it when the sentence is against themselves. The Duke of Wellington might have admired the conduct of the Lord Chancellor, had it not unfortunately happened that it amounted to a reproof of his Grace, in his capacity of Lord-Lieutenant of Hampshire.

A Sunday paper (the Observer) remarks—" The illustrious duke put hypothetically some cases, in which the Lord Chancellor might wish, for political purposes, to include improper persons in the commission of the peace; but we have a strong suspicion that the cause of the noble duke's soreness is to be found in the consciousness that lie himself, as Lord Lieutenant of Hampshire, had objected to the insertion in the commission for that county of the name of such a gentleman as Mr. Augustus Moreton, Lord Ducie's son, and resident in the Isle of Wight, simply because Mr. Augustus Moreton was the Liberal member for Gloucestershire. Are we mistaken in adding that the illustrious duke did also object to the appointment of Mr. Oglander as a magistrate for that same county, because he too had upon him a taint of Reform principles ?"
