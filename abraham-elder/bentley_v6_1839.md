TALES AND LEGENDS OF THE ISLE OF WIGHT.

WITH THE ADVENTURES OF THE AUTHOR IN SEARCH OF THEM. BY ABRAHAM ELDER, ESQ.

ST. NICHOLAS.

"ST. NICHOLAS, Bishop of Myra in the fourth century, was a saint of great virtue, and disposed so early in life to conform to ecclesiastical rule, that when an infant at the breast he fasted on Wednesday and Friday, and sucked but once on each of those days, and that towards night. `[Ribandineira, vol. ii. p. 503.]` An Asiatic gentleman sending his two sons to Athens for education, ordered them to wait on the bishop for his benediction. On arriving at Myra with their baggage, they took up their lodging at an inn, purposing, as it was late in the day, to defer their visit till the morrow; but in the mean time the innkeeper, to secure their effects to himself, killed the young gentlemen, cut them into pieces, salted them, and intended to sell them for pickled pork. St. Nicholas, being favoured with a sight of these proceedings in a vision, went to the inn and reproached the cruel landlord for his crime, who immediately confessing it, entreated the saint to pray to Heaven for his pardon. The bishop, moved by his confession and contrition, besought forgiveness for him, and supplicated restoration of life to the children. He had scarcely finished when the pieces reunited, and the animated youths threw themselves from the brinetub at the bishop's feet. He raised them up, exhorted them to return thanks to God alone, gave them good advice for the future, bestowed his blessing upon them, and sent them to Athens with great joy to prosecute their studies.

"St. Nicholas was the patron of scholars and of youth, of sailors, and of the company of parish clerks of London. He was called the Child Bishop, on account of the strictness with which he fasted when an infant at the breast. Formerly, in all our cathedrals, his anniversary, the 6th of December, was thus celebrated: A boy to represent the boy bishop was elected from among the choristers. He was invested with great authority, and had the state of a diocesan bishop from the time of his election until Innocents' Day (the 28th of the same month). He was to bear the name and maintain the state of a bishop, habited with a crosier or pastoral-staff in his hand, and a mitre on his head. His fellows, the rest of the children of the choir, were to take upon them the style and office of prebendaries, and yield the bishop canonical obedience; and further, the same service as the very bishop himself, with his dean and prebendaries, had thus been used to officiate, were to have performed, the very same, mass excepted, was done by the chorister and his canons upon the eve and holiday. It further appears that this infant bishop did, to a certain limit, receive to his own use rents, capons, and other emoluments of the church. In case the little bishop died within the month, his exequies were solemnized with great pomp, and he was interred, like other bishops, with all his ornaments. There is still to be seen in the cathedral at Salisbury a monument erected to one of these boy bishops. On the stone is sculptured the figure of a child clad in the episcopal habits. It has sorely puzzled many respectable antiquaries.

"St. Nicholas was also considered to be the patron of maidens, In many convents it is said that he used to come in the night of the eve of his feast-day and fill the nuns' stockings with sugar-plums whilst they were asleep."

"Pray what is the latest date at which these boy bishops made their appearance?" asked the tutor; "for the ceremony seems very extraordinary."

"Queen Elizabeth finally put an end to it. But it is not near so extraordinary as the Feast of Fools, that was annually celebrated in the neighbouring abbey of Quarr, or Quarraria. Upon New-year's day they elected a Fool Abbot, who was dressed out in imitation of the real abbot. He was attended by his proper officers, ridiculously habited. One of the ceremonies was to shave the precentor of fools upon a stage erected before the chapel, in the presence of the people, who were amused during the operation by his loose and vulgar discourses, accompanied by actions equally reprehensible.

"They afterwards entered the chapel, and performed the service, attended by every species of buffoonery; some wearing masks representing monsters, or with their faces smutted or chalked; some personated females, and conducted themselves indecorously. During divine service they sang indecent songs in the choir, ate rich puddings upon the altar, and burnt old shoes for incense, and ran jumping all over the chapel. The Abbot of Fools performed the service habited in pontifical garments, and gave his benediction. The mass, however, was composed for the occasion, and was called the Fool's Prose.

"These abominable and impious ceremonies were probably originally instituted with a view to Christianise the *Bacchanalia* and *Saturnalia*. They were called the December Liberties." `[TH: see also eg https://github.com/psychemedia/winter-tales/blob/main/src/lord-of-misrule.md ]`

"Pray, sir, who was this King Stuff, sole monarch of the Isle of Wight, that you spoke of just now?" asked the tutor.

"Never heard of King Stuff?" said the antiquary. "Why, Mr. Elder informed me that you were a Master of Arts, and had taken first-class honours at Oxford. You must at least have read of Stuff and Witgar in the Saxon Chronicles?"

"I never heard of the Saxon Chronicles," was the reply. "Never heard of the Saxon Chronicles!" said the antiquary, lifting up his hands in astonishment. "Perhaps you never heard of King Alfred?"

"I read about him at school; but I never troubled myself about the history of England after I got to the University. A man may take every degree that Oxford confers without even having heard of William the Conqueror. But I can tell you all about Jupiter, and Mars, and Venus; and I could give you a very correct account of the lives and the amours of the heathen gods and goddesses, all which it was absolutely necessary for me to learn; besides which —"

TO DO

"But am I to understand, then, that the study of the language and the history of England is totally neglected?"

"Oh no, — not the language certainly. We study diligently the Greek and Latin languages, from which our English tongue is derived."

The antiquary puffed out both his cheeks, and gave a very long peculiar whistle, to the utter astonishment of all of us, of me not the least, for I had never heard the old gentleman whistle before. I had no idea that he knew how to whistle. The two undergraduates, convulsed with laughter, dropped behind to enjoy their laugh more at their ease. The tutor and myself looked at one another, and contrived to keep our countenance. After a long pause, the antiquary said,

"And so you think that the English tongue is derived from the Greek and Latin! Pray young man," said he, addressing one of the Oxonians, "what do you consider the Latin word homo to be derived from?"

"Quasi ex hnmo" was the reply. . "Right," said the tutor.

"Quasi ex fiddlestick!" said the antiquary. "Homo is derived from the English word man, or at least from the Gothic, which is only an old form of the English." The tutor smiled, and arched up his eyebrows. The antiquary continued — "Homo, like most of the common words in every language, has been much corrupted and, as it were, worn by use. We meet with the root, however, in the genitive case ho?>«/m. The adjective humanus is, however, quite clear. Hu-man signifies the good man."

"Eu, certainly does mean good," said the tutor.

"In Greek," added one of the younger ones.

"Signifies good! — to be sure it does," said the antiquary; "what is more, it is derived from the word good." The tutor's eyebrows went up again. The antiquary went on — "G and y were formerly pronounced alike; so that good is that which yoo'd, or made good. It is a regular participle-past, though the rest of tshe verb is obsolete."

"I do not quite follow your meaning," said the tutor.

"Well, then," said the antiquary, "what is the meaning of the word humanus? It means — like the action of a good man. Inhumanus means — unlike the action of a good man. Now let us leave out the hu, and see what becomes of it. Immanis means monstrous, or unlike the action of a man at all."

"This is very curious, it must be confessed," replied the tutor, who was completely puzzled by this display of learning. But you forgot to tell me who this King Stuff was."

"King Stuff," replied the antiquary, "was the nephew of Cerdic, King of the West Saxons, who was the son of Elesa, who was the son of Esla, who was the son of Gewis, the son of Wye, the son of Frewin, the son of Frithgar, the son of Brand, the son of Baldav, the son of Woden."

Thank you, thank you, thank you," said the tutor, fearing that the antiquary was only stopping to take breath before he carried the pedigree up to Adam.

Here ragged Jack impudently put in his word in support of his patron — "I can assure you, sir, that he came of a very respectable family."

But the antiquary reproved him with dignity, saying, "Jack, you can know nothing about it."

"And pray, Mr. Winterblossom, who succeeded King Stuff in his island kingdom?"

"There is very little known of the history of the island after that time till the invasion of Wulfhere, about which there is a very pleasant history still remaining."

"We should consider ourselves under great obligations to you, if you would favour us with it."

"I shall have great pleasure in doing so."

WULFHERE THE KINU-HEAKTED.

"In the year 661, Wulfhere, the son of Penda, invaded the Isle of Wight. He penetrated with his ships up the lake of Brerding (now called Brading Haven), and sei/ed upon the town of Woolverton, to which he did no injury; for he came to free the inhabitants from the cruelties of Sebert, who reigned over them, and to cause the Christian truths to be preached to the Jutes,* who then dwelt in the Isle of Wight. But the Jutes, when they saw the Angles under Wulfhere land and take possession of their town by force of arms, would not trust to their offers of friendship; but they assembled on the hills around, under the banners of Sebert, and descending like a storm from the mountain, fell upon the army of Wulfhere; and Redwald, surnamed the Bold, with twenty followers penetrated to where the chief of the Angles fought in person. But as they lifted their spears to throw them, Wulfhere said, 'Before our blood flows, let me speak one word. I come not here for conquest, or to destroy the lives of the Jutes, but to free them from the cruelties of Sebert.' Then Redwald the Bold answered, 'The Jutes trust not to the Angles when they come in arms and wet their spears in our blood.' Balday threw his spear, but Wulfhere avoided it; and the spear of Wulfhere struck the shield of Redwald, but did him no injury. But the Angles were in great power, and the Jutes were driven back to their hills. Many, indeed, fled early in the day, for they loved not their leader Sebert.

"Wulf here crossed the river Yar, and rested at Brerding.t Here he built a Christian church, and Eoppa.a mass-priest who came with him, consecrated it, and stood ready to baptize the Pagan Jutes.

"After which Wulfhere pursued Sebert, and burned his castle of Witgarisberig.+ Afterwards they met in battle, and Sebert was slain; but Redwald still held them at bay. He was left almost alone,

* Jutis, — Bede, Hist. Ecdes.vol. i. p. IT), — not Vitis, as Gibson quotes him. The Goths, Jutes, and GetiE were the same people; whence the peninsula of Jutland, as well as the isle of Gothland, is called Gotland hy King Alfred in the periplus of Oht-here. From Jutna-cynn, Jeatna-kyn, come Jenkyn, Jenkyns, Jenkins, &c. facts highly interesting to a number of persons at present inhabiting the principality of Wales.

and the spears of several were lifted to strike him, when a maiden rushed in and threw herself at the feet of Wulf here.

"'Save him! save him! oh Wulfhere, surnamed the Kindhearted! '

"Her arms were clasped round his knees, and her long yellow hair poured in flowing ringlets on the ground; her face, as it looked up for pity, was the fairest he had ever beheld. Wulfhere's voice was heard, and the points of his warriors' spears were turned upward.

"'Maiden, thy prayer is granted.' He raised her from the ground. 'And who art thou?' he said.

"'I am Edith of Stenbury,' she replied.

"Kedwald threw down his weapon, and crossed his arms upon his breast,

"'King of the Angles, I am your prisoner.'

"'Chieftain/ Wulf here replied, 'I take no prisoners. You are free to come and to go as the winds of heaven, — free to walk in peaceful garb or wear the arms of a warrior. The cruelties of Sebert are no more; — let those who have suffered injuries come to me, and I will right them.'

"'Wulfhere,' answered Redwald, 'you are justly surnamed the Kind-hearted. We doubted the word of a stranger; but now we know you. You have brought freedom and happiness to ouv island.'

"After which Wulfhere and Redwald became as brothers, and for a time they ruled the island together.

"Wulfhere loved the chase, and he said one day to Redwald,

"'Where shall we chase the boar? '

"Redwald replied, 'The stag is on all our hills, but the finest boars harbour in the forest of Bordwood.'

"Foresters were sent to track the boars to their lairs, and in the evening the two chieftains took up their abode in the neighbourhood of Bordwood, with their dogs and foresters. The fire was lighted in the middle of the floor, and the smoke rolled up through the opening in the roof. While the venison for their evening meal was being roasted, Wulfhere and Redwald related to one another the traditions of other days, and the deeds of arms that their fathers had done. At length the meat is placed upon the board, and the winecup passes round; the foresters and henchmen share the feast, and the dogs sit watching for their portion by their master's knee. The time wore on— at length the straw is spread upon the ground. The two chieftains sleep side by side — chiefs, foresters, and hounds are soon wrapped in sleep. But Cuthin, the henchman of Wulfhere, lies with his body across the wicker door, and his two rough boarhounds sleep beside him. Long before the dawn of day the morning meal was broiling on the fire, and the wine-cup again passed round; and before the sun had risen from the sea they were threading the tangled copsewood of Bordwood.

"Wulfhere and Redwald at length stop, and Cuthin, the henchman of Wulfhere, holding a single boar-hound in a leash, stands a little behind them. The forester has gone round with his two hounds to rouse the boar, and drive him towards the hunters. The forester's horn is heard— the boar is up. Wulfhere motions to Redwald to take

the first. Presently the boar is heard crashing through the copsewood; Redwald stands beside the open pathway, and raises his spear on high. As the boar rushed past, the spear struck him behind the shoulder, and he fell dead.

"'Well struck, Prince of the Island!' shouted Wulf here. 'The next is mine.'

"They went to another spot. The forester's horn is heard again. Wulfhere takes his place; but the huge monster saw the hunter in his track, and would have turned off' on one side, but one of the hounds that followed saw him swerve, and sprung forward and drove him back again towards the hunter. But the boar's course was unsteady, and Wulfhere's spear gave no mortal wound, but glanced down the side of his rib, and stuck into the ground. The boar passed by, and then turning round with blood-shot eye and foaming mouth, he rushes full upon Wulfhere. Wulfhere drew his sword, and holding his cloak before him with his left hand, he dropt upon his knee, and awaited the attack. The boar's tusk had already stirred the folds of the cloak before Wulfhere moved; he then sprang from behind the cloak, and plunged his sword into the side of the boar.

"'Well struck, King of the Angles!" shouted Redwald.

"'It's a fine beast! The next is yours, Redwald.'

"'I'll try if I can spit him on the spear's point, as the Britons do,' was the reply.

"When they came to where the next boar was harboured, Redwald threw off his short cloak, and gave it to his henchman, unbelted his sword, and laid the naked blade upon the ground by his feet; he placed the spear under his arm, shortening it so that his arm was about the middle of the shaft; he held the point firmly before him with both his hands; and as the boar approached, he dropped upon one knee. The boar, which was very large and fierce, ran straight at him, and pierced himself dead upon the spear.

"'That boar was right well slain, Redwald. If the forester has another harboured, I will try my luck with the spear's point.'

"Another boar was found, — the forester's horn sounded. Wulfhere had prepared himself as Redwald had done: there came, however, only two half-grown swine. Wulfhere stood aside, and let them pass; but as he was turning away, he heard the brushwood crackling, and the dogs barking behind. He had hardly time to drop upon his knee and bring his spear up before the boar was upon him. The spear's point did not strike the animal truly; and before Wulfhere could leap aside, the beast's tusk was fixed in his thigh, and, had not Redwald quickly spitted the animal with his spear, Wulfhei'e's body would have been ripped up by the tusk. As it was, though it had not time to tear the flesh, the tusk had made a fearful hole.

"The foresters made a litter of boughs, and carried Wulfhere home, and melancholy were the countenances of all, both Saxons and Jutes. The fair Edith of Stenbury attended his bedside, and bound up his wound. Night and day she sat by his couch watching the changes of the fever, or altering the bindings, or putting ointments to his wound. At length the fever left him, and strength was returning to his limb. He walked about leaning on his staff. One evening that he was alone with Edith, he said to her,

"'Edith, I enjoy everything that wealth, and power, and honour can give; yet one thing is wanting to make me truly happy.' He paused — Edith also remained silent. 'Before I landed on this island, my mind was free as the air, I had no care beyond that of the passing moment; but now my mind is full of anxious thoughts, and hopes, and fears. Since I first beheld you, my fairest Edith, my bosom burns with love: be mine, and I shall be the happiest of men. Say that you love me not, and I shall be the most unhappy.'

"Edith coloured deeply, and her looks were bent upon the ground. At length she said,

"O generous Prince of the Angles! my hand and my life are at your disposal. Edith of Stenbury is an orphan, and you are her only chieftain; it is for you to bestow her hand and her lands upon whom it may please you. She knows the duty of a Saxon maiden too well to question your authority, or to speak of her own wishes. But as you have thought to honour me above all the maidens that you have ever seen, to bestow upon me the pri/e that the fairest of my sex are sighing for, it is but right that I should tell you, that though I would serve you in all humility and duty; yet that love which is already possessed by another it is not in my power to bestow. Wulfhere, I am not worthy of you — I could not render you happy."

"Wulfhere and the maiden long looked upon the ground in silence — they were both very sorrowful. At length Wulfhere asked,

"'Does he who holds your affection love you in return.'

"'That I know not.'

"'Now it flashes across my mind. The tone of voice — the devoted energy with which you prayed for Eedwald's life — Have I guessed right? '

"The maiden gave no answer, but her cheek was tinged with a deeper crimson. Wulfhere called his henchman.

"'Bring Redwald here. — Kedwald, speak truly. Do you love this maiden? '

4f Redwald replied, 'I do from the bottom of my heart; but I fear she returns not my love.'

"Wulfhere said, 'You are both believers in the Christian truth: let Eoppa pronounce his blessing on you, that God may prosper the union.'

"It was done so.

"Then said Wulfhere, 'The south wind which now blows will to-morrow fill my sail. J shall leave you, my dear friends, and this beautiful island, never to return again. Govern the islanders in justice, as I have done. Ethel ward,' the king of the South Saxons, will protect you with his powerful arms, for I was his sponsor in baptism.'

"The next day Wulfhere entered his ship; and as he took his leave of Redwald and Edith he passed his rough hand across his eyes. 'Farewell! Farewell for ever!'"

LEGENDS OF THE ISLE OF WIGHT.

WITH THE ADVENTURES OF THE AUTHOR IN SEARCH OF THEM. BY ABRAHAM ELDER, ESQ.

BORTHWOOD forest was an extensive tract of wild and well-wooded country, lying on this side of Shanklin. You will see,, when you pass that way, a singularly-pointed conical hill, with a peasant's cottage perched upon the top of it, rising out of a comparatively level country. It is known to this day by the name of "The Queen's Bower." Its use, and the origin of its name, are as follow:—

It was the custom of our Norman ancestors, when they gave a grand hunting entertainment, to select an open space, as near as might be in the centre of their hunting-ground; and choosing some natural mount, or forming an artificial one, they erected upon it a pavilion, in which were placed the ladies, and such of their company as did not intend personally to take a part in the chase. A large portion of the forest was then surrounded by as many of the chief retainers as could be got together. These advanced in a circle, making a great noise, gradually contracting the area of the circle, until at length all the beasts that they had disturbed were driven into the appointed hunting-ground. Here the knights who had assembled for the chase, lay in wait for them near the openings through which it was probable that the game would issue from the forest. The knights were generally on horseback, armed with bows and arrows, and attended with their squires holding their dogs in leash. As the deer passed, they shot their arrows, and let their dogs loose upon the game, and generally with fatal effect; for skill in every branch of the art of hunting appears to have been the great test of a man's being a gentleman.

The hill still called the Queen's Bower derives its name from the circumstance of Isabella de Fortibus, the lady of the Isle of Wight in the reign of Edward the First, having there erected her huntingpavilion. This lady, so celebrated in the local history of the island, was sometimes styled the Queen of the Isle of Wight; and, indeed, though feudally subject to the Crown of England, her authority within her own dominions was quite despotic, and she lived in her castle of Carisbrook in a magnificence and state worthy of royalty.

A very curious account of a hunting of this lady, or Queen of the Isle of Wight, in Borthwood forest, is preserved in an ancient manuscript* in the British Museum. It appears that a certain knight visited her court in disguise; and Isabella, wishing to satisfy her doubts as to whether he was come of noble blood or not, without committing a breach of ancient hospitality by asking him questions, proposes a grand hunting-match, that he might prove his noble breeding by his skill in the chase. The manuscript is as follows: —

"On the morrow, whan yt was day, To her men she gan to say,

• Ancient MS. Brit. Mus. Harl. MSS. 2252,44. Wart. Eng. Poet. vol. i. p. 198. VOL. VI. T

Lok ye be all redy dight, ,  

With your houndis more and lesse  

In forrest to take my gresse,*  

And tharc I will myself be,

And with hem her houndis ladde,^

Full well he thought to note hem there.  

Whan they came to the lande on hight,  

The queen's pavylyon there was pight,§  

That she might see all the best  

All the game of the forrest;  

And to the ladye brought many a best,  

Herte and hynd, buck and doe,  

And other bestis many mo.  

The houndis that were of gret prise  

Plucked down deer all atryse.  

Ippomedon, he with his houndis throo,||  

Drew down both buck and doo,

Thus this royal lady having ascertained that Sir Ippomedon was a good shot with a bow, that his greyhounds were of the right breed, and that he knew how to cut up his deer when he had brought it down, goes home to dinner satisfied that the stranger knight is a gentleman every inch of him.

GODSHILL.

Having received a letter from Captain Nosered, of Violet Cottage, Ventnor, containing an invitation for Mr. Winterblossom and myself to spend the day with him, stating at the same time that he had a tale for me connected with that neighbourhood, very curious, and well-authenticated, which he wished to show me; as the captain was an old friend of mine, we accepted the invitation, and set out in a car together the next day.

"Pray, sir," said I, as we went along, "what is that church that I see yonder perched up at the top of a hill?"

"Godshill," answered the antiquary.

"Godshill! Pray can you inform me how it got that name? It cannot be because it is nearer to heaven than the country round it."

"I certainly never heard that reason for it before. I always understood that it had been named Godshill in commemoration of a miracle that tradition tells us was performed at the building of the church. The story, as it is now told, and by many still believed, in the Isle of Wight, is as follows: —

"A sum of money having been given by certain pious individuals, whose names unfortunately are now lost, for the erection of a church, the religious authorities of the Island, under whose direction it was to be erected, looked out for a proper site for it. After mature deliberation, they fixed upon a spot at the foot of the steep eminence upon which the present church stands.

"Having arranged this to their own satisfaction, they sent a messenger to the proprietor of the land, informing him that the Bishop of the Isle of Wight, after a solemn consultation with a council composed of ancient and holy men, having at heart the spiritual welfare of his island flock, had at length decided upon conferring upon him the high honour and distinction of allowing the church to be built upon his land; and he begged him moreover not to be puffed up with pride thereat, but to receive the favour thus conferred upon him with all humility and gratitude.

"Now it so happened that the owner of this land was a poor franklin (a freeholder), of very limited means and a very large family, and moreover he was by no means of a religious turn of mind. In his heart he hated all priests and monks; he went to sleep at mass when he did attend it; fast-day and feast were to him alike; and as for confession, he avoided it altogether, — not because he had nothing to confess, but because he was afraid of frightening the priest if he told the truth; and where was the good of confession if he told lies.

"There were, however, occasional exceptions to this rule. There was a certain jolly wandering friar, who used to visit him occasionally and shrive him, without being too particular about trifles; and, besides, he used to hear his confession after supper, which tended to make it pass off very smoothly. Once, indeed, the friar ordered him a slight penance; but then upon that visit he found his landlord's ale a little turned, which might in some degree have soured his temper. The franklin used to say, that a simmering mug of ale, with a roasted crab bobbing about in it, would get him absolution from any sin in the world.

"This being the character of the man who owned the land, it may easily be imagined that, although he avoided the first evil of being conferred upon him with all the humility and gratitude required of him.

"He did not, however, dare to fly in the face of his powerful self-styled benefactors. He hemmed, and hawed, and coughed, and then remarked what a splendid site for the church there was just at the top of the hill.

"He was informed that that situation had been well considered, and it was thought to be too much exposed.

"The franklin then changed his tone, and, looking down to the ground with a well-feigned humility, he said to the monk —

"'Father, the fact is, I am a very great sinner; and if the church is built upon land belonging to me, it will be erected upon unholy ground. I pray you, father, consider this well. My neighbours on both sides are pious persons, and their land contains magnificent sites for building churches. If you build your church upon their land, it will not stand upon unholy ground; and the high honour will be conferred upon a pious person, who is worthy to be distinguished by the favour, of the bishop and his reverend council.'

"The monk replied, 'Your being a sinner is no obstacle, but the reverse; for, when the foundation stone is laid, you will receive absolution for all your sins, be they ever so black; and as for the land being tainted with unholiness, we can consecrate that.'

"The franklin was now sorely puzzled what to say. He mattered something about the largeness of his family and the smallness of his farm, and how the spot fixed upon was the best bit of the whole, and how he might be reduced to poverty.

"The monk, however, turned a deaf ear to all this, affecting either not to hear or not to understand the drift of his argument; and so, without in the least committing himself by any hint about the possibility of compensation, he hied him back to his masters, and told them how, when he had delivered his message, the franklin bent his eyes with all humility towards the ground, and replied, that he was too great a sinner for so high an honour to be conferred upon him.

"In the due course of time the bishop's architect came to survey the spot, and trace out the lines of the foundation, and some stones from the quarry at Binstead were piled in a heap, ready for the commencement of the building. The next morning the architect and the masons made their appearance. How great was their astonishment to find not a single stone remaining where they had placed it, and not a single peg or mark put in by the architect remaining there!

"They stood here for some time, first staring at the bare field, then looking at one another, and then staring at the ground again.

"'Where are all the buildng stones gone to?' said one.

"'Where are all my pegs that marked out the lines of the foundation?' said the architect.

"Where are all the stones and the pegs gone to, Master Franklin? What tricks have you been playing us, Master Franklin?' said one of them to the owner of the field.

"The franklin looked innocence itself, then opened his eyes and his mouth, and raised up his hands in mute astonishment.

"'It strikes me' said one of the labourers, scratching his head, 'that we most just have mistaken our way, and come to the wrong field.'

"That's quite impossible!' said two or three of the others, speaking together.

"While they were thus debating, the owner of the land at the top of the hill made his appearance among them.

"'Is this fair? – is this right? — is this honourable?' said he.

"'What fair?— what right?' rejoined the architect. 'We do not understand you.'

"'I know well,' said the man from the top of the hill, 'that land is oftentimes seized to erect a church upon, without compensation being given to the owner; but I ask you, is it not hard, very hard, that the foundations of a church should be pegged out, and the stones placed ready for the builder, upon my land, without my being told a word about it beforehand? Sir, I honour the priesthood and holy men as a good man ought; but not when they come like a thief in the night to plunder me of my patrimony. Fie! fie! Master Architect. What! — must you come in the night, while I am asleep, to mark out your foundations, and place your building-stones all ready to begin with? Why, if I had overslept myself, I might almost have found when I awoke my best field converted into buildings and churchyards.'

"What can the man mean?' said the architect, when the little man from the top of the hill stopped to take breath.

"Why, it is just what I thought,' said one of the masons; 'there must be two fields somehow or other so exactly alike, that we must have mistaken the one for the other.'

"'I can assure you,' said our friend the franklin, putting in his word, 'that, although he appears a little excited at present, he is a very sensible, respectable, pious man; but what he is talking about I cannot imagine.'

"'Look up there,' said the little man from the top of the hill; 'there they have already brought stones to commence a church with, and have actually begun to mark out the direction of the foundations.'

"In consequence, everybody did look up in the direction he pointed, and certainly they did perceive the tops of two heaps of stones showing themselves above the brow of the hill. The architect and his assistants immediately directed their steps there, and, to their great astonishment, they found the building-stones disposed in much the same order on the top of the hill that they had placed them in the field below.

"What was to be done? The bishop had arranged that he should come that very afternoon to lay the first stone of the church himself. There was, therefore, no time to be lost; so, without speculating further how the stones had contrived to get up to the top of a steep hill without assistance, they set themselves to work in good earnest to bring them down again; and before the appointed time for the bishop's arrival the stones were all heaped up as they were before, the architect had pegged out the shape of the new church, and a little part of the foundation had been dug, ready to receive the first stone.

"Shortly after the hour at which the bishop was expected, a group of monks and other ecclesiastics were seen collectad together in the distance waiting for him. After the lapse of about twenty minutes, the dignitary himself riding on a mule, attended by about six or seven mounted attendants, joined their inferior brethren, who were awaiting him. They now formed themselves into a procession, walking two and two, those on foot marching first, then the bishop; his mounted companions followed two and two, and a few more attendants on foot brought up the rear.

"As they advanced at a slow pace, they chanted a psalm. One half of them chanted the first verse, the other half replied to them in a higher note, while here and there their united voices swelled into a loud chorus.

"The workmen and the peasantry, who were assembled round the destined site of the new church, listened with deep devotion to the solemn notes of the holy song, now swelling loud, now dying away upon the summer wind.

"When the procession arrived at the spot, the monks on foot filed to the right and to the left, still raising their voices, and turning up their eyes towards heaven. The bishop on his mule now arrived in front, and it was expected that he would dismount and offer up a prayer for the success of their undertaking. Had he been on foot, there is no doubt but that he would have done so; but mules are animals proverbially obstinate, delighting in showing that they have a will of their own, independent of their master's. So was it in the present instance; for the animal, instead of stopping short, as he was directed to do, continued to walk leisurely on, till at length he quickened his pace into a trot, and he had actually ascended half way up the steep hill in front before he could be brought to a full stop. At length the bishop returned crestfallen and out of humour, and having taken his appointed place, he commenced his prayer for the success of the undertaking, resting his knee upon an embroidered footstool, while the rest of the congregation knelt upon the ground. After his prayer was concluded, some masonic tools and a small silver coin were given to him. He now, with the assistance of two masons, deposited the coin, and settled down the stone upon it. They chanted a psalm; and when this was concluded, the bishop's attendant deacon called for the franklin by name. When he had come, the bishop said, 'Kneel down.'

"The franklin knelt.

"The bishop then, after praising him for his piety, pronounced a full absolution for all his sins, and all the ecclesiastics responded in a deep 'Amen.' The bishop then gave the whole assembly bis parting benediction, and the ceremony was at an end.

"As the venerable fathers rode home together, they discussed and rediscussed, and commented upon the curious tale of which they had heard several versions that morning; how all the building-stones, together with the architect's markers and pegs, had been mysteriously conveyed away from their allotted spot to the top of a steep hill in the neighbourhood. It could not have been chance. If the stones had rolled from the top of the hill down to the bottom, it would have been another thing; but stones cannot roll up a hill.

"Was it a miracle? Catholic priests in all ages of the world are supposed to be oftener preachers than believers of the miracles that take place under their own eyes; so, though the possibility of its having been a miracle was thrown out once or twice, the majority were decidedly against the opinion that a miracle had been worked in the present instance.

"Then there was a third supposition. It might have been a trick played upon them by some base reprobate. This appeared to them all to be much more unlikely than either of the two foregoing suppositions. Where could a man be found so utterly wicked as to wish to do such an action? Certainly not in the Isle of Wight, so celebrated for its piety. But even suppose such a man was found, how was it possible to imagine for a moment that he would dare to do it? The church can excommuuicate as well as bless; besides, people had been burnt alive for sacrilege before; then what object could any person possibly have in doing so? It certainly could not be merely for the sake of running the chance of being burnt alive, with the addition of the curses of the church, and the execration of all mankind. Then, again, how could he possibly carry his intentions into execution, even if he was mad enough to desire it? It could have been no light labour to have carried all the stones up the hill; and it was evidently quite impossible to have done it without being observed by some of the neighbours; and what neighbour would dare to conceal such an action from the Holy Church?

"At length one of the brothers interrupted this discussion, saying, in a most solemn tone,

"'In the blindness of your hearts, and in the eagerness of your talking, yon have altogether forgotten the most important fact of all.'

"'What is that?' demanded two or three at once.

"'Had it not been for the assistance of two strong men in stopping his mule, the bishop himself would have been carried up to the top of the hill.'

"It would never have done for the other ecclesiastics to have cast any reflections upon the horsemanship of their superior; so it was absolutely necessary for them all to come to the conclusion that there was something very supernatural and wonderful in the whole affiiir. Thus ostensibly, at any rate, the theory of the miracle carried it hollow.

"The bishop, however, between whom and the mule similar differences of opinion, attended with precisely the same results, had frequently occurred before, could not in his heart subscribe to the proof that appeared to have convinced the rest; so he thus addressed his attendants.

"Brethren, however singular may have appeared whhat we have heard and seen this day, we ought not lightly to adopt an opinion that anything has occurred out of the common order of nature, lest other causes, simple and obvious to the unlearned, should by chance be brought to light, sufficient to account for what has happened, and thus the authority of the Church be brought into jeopardy. I will therefore order two men to be placed to watch the spot to-night, and to-morrow we will discuss this matter again, after they should have made their report.'

"One of his attendants was in consequence sent back to direct two of the workmen to remain on the spot all night, and to give them his blessing, which was accordingly done.

"A messenger from the bishop was sent to them again in the morning, to see whether all had remained quiet during the night. The account that he brought beck was, that he found the two men lying upon the ground in a helpless state, like men weary in body
and opprataed with strong drink. He roused them with some trouble, and they then gave a very strange and marvellous account of what they had seen and heard during the night.

"The most extraordinary fact, however, that the messenger had to report was, that the stones had all contrived to get up to the top of this hill again; the foundation-stone had been taken away, and the trench filled up, and the turf laid smooth again.

"Upon ascending the hill, they found the building-stones bestowed in the same form they were the morning before; the lines of the foundation were in the same manner pegged out by the architect's marks; a small portion of the foundation had been dug, and the first stone had been laid, — the identical first stone that had been laid by the bisbop in another place the evening before.

"The bishop, upon hearing this, ordered the two watchers and all the other persons who had been employed the day previous to be brought before him. The account that the two watchers gave was, that about midnight they were startled by a low rumbling noise, which appeared to issue from the heaps of stones. Presently the stones were observed to move, rolling about one against another, just as if there was a large body movine about and kicking in the midst of the heap; then a little stone rolled off the top of the heap, and tumbled on the ground; but it quite made their hair stand on end to see that, instead of stopping there, it kept on rolling and rolling, -where the ground was rough it hopped and skipped, and then went on rolling again in the direction of the hill. Then out came another stone, and rolled, and skipped, and rolled like the first. In a little time, when the stones had contrived to shake themselves out of the heap, where they seemed to be very much in one another's way, they all began rollng away together, — the little ones going faster and more nimbly than the others. The watchers said that they had some difficulty in getting out of the way, there were so many of them on the move together. A large stone, indeed, did come foul of one of them, hit him on the shin, and knocked him out of the way, nearly breaking his leg, and then went bowling on, as if it did not care whether his leg was broken or not.

"When the stones had all gone by, they determined, though they were very much frightened at the time, to follow them, and see what they would do. They overtook them at a steep pitch of the hill, which appeared to offer considerable hindrance to their ascent The little ones, indeed, were seen scrambling up without any great great difficulty; but the large heavy ones coukl hardly get on at all. Some of them rolled half way over, and then rolled back again, but, afler one or two efforts, they generally got a roll in advance; and when they passed the steep pitch, they bowled away again merrily.

"The watchers waited until they had all passed the difficulty except one large stone, with a very awkward angle sticking out of its side, which seemed effectually to prevent its turning over at all. It contrived to turn half way over, and then rolled back again, and this it had repeated so often, that it had actually worked itself into a hole, and all its efforts to extricate iteelf seemed hopeless.

"The watchers consulted with one another whether it would not be an act of charity to lend the poor stone a hand, and then they knelt down and put their shoulders against its under side and gave a heave. The great awkward stone rolled over, and then kept scrambling on as if it had been just as well made as the rest of its companions.

"They followed the stones to the top of the hill to watch their proceedings there. The stones in several places were seen huddling themselves close together, and there were some others rolled up to them, and gave one hop, and jumped on to the top of them, till at leagth there were seen piled up in just such heaps as they lay in before down below. Then the pegs — the architect's pegs were hopping about upon the ground like sparrows; but their wooden heads did not seem to be half so sharp-witted as the stones, for they seemed sorely puzzled where to place themselves, notwithstanding the apparent exertions of a tall wand, with a bit of coloured rag at the top of it, which kept constantly moving backward and forward, now sticking himself in at one corner, and then at another, probably much in dthe same way that it had previously done under the architect's directions. But long before they had made their arrangements to anything like their own satisfaction, up hopped a spade, which banged across the ground they were marking, knocking down two or three pegs in his way without any ceremony, and began sedulously digging and throwing out the earth. It was marvellous to see how it crammed itself into the ground, and then threw out the earth, without any hand or foot to guide it.

"When it had dug a hole sufficiently large, up rolled a large flat stone, and squatted itself down in it. The stone was afterwards found to be the same identical stone that had been laid by the bishop with so much ceremony down below.

"This was the account given by the two men who had been set to watch.

"One of the other men employed now stepped forward, and said, that with regard to the bad hurt that one of the watchers had got upon his shin, he was quite certain that his companion had not received that hurt up to late in the evening before. They always worked with bare legs, and he must therefore have seen it.

"Here the bishop and his council put their heads together, and consulted a little in an under tone. It was evident that the man had received his hurt some time during the night, and not during his work hours; and it was quite incredible that he could purposely have inflicted such an injury upon himself. This was a strong piece of circumstantial evidence, and went far to prove the truth of the story. Then the account given by these two men agreed so exactly in every particular, — they were so accurate in the description of every minute circumstance, — all the different parts of the story fitted so well together, that they considered it unnecessary to hear any farther evidence upon the subject The bishop then dismissed the assembly.

"Two days after this the bishop, attended by the principal ecclesiastics and the chief inhabitants of the Isle of Wight, went in solemn procession to consecrate the new site of the church. The ceremony was very similar to the preceding one, except that the bishop recited at great length, and with some trifling alterations and additions, the wonderful miracle that had taken place upon the spot. After he had concluded his address, they raised the foundation-stone to see whether the piece of money was still lying under it.

"Great was the astonishment of all the assembly to find that it was gone, and exactly in the spot where it should have been was found the paring of a thumb-nail As soon as this was publicly announced, a loud and universal shout arose — 'A relic! a holy relic!' I pass over altogether, for it would be grating to the ear of every religious Protestant, the consultations that were held upon the subject, the processions that followed, the masses that were said, the adorations that were paid to this trumpery and filthy object. It is sufficient to know that the site was consecrated, the church was built, and the ground upon which it was erected has ever since been known by the name of God's-hill.

"The franklin was highly pleased to have had all his sins absolved by the bishop himself, without the necessity of any confession; while his cows still ranged over his favourite field; and the two watchers never passed that way without partaking of the best cheer that the franklin could set before them."

A LEGEND OF PUCKASTER


A LEGEND OF PUCKASTER,  
ISLE OF WIGHT.  
BY ABRAHAM ELDER, ESQ.

John Kann was a labouring man, living in the parish of Whitewell; and, in the good old times, when fairies danced, was said to have been particularly favoured by them. This was a matter of considerable importance at the time, for he lived in a neighbourhood where they were most numerous and active. `[Burton, in his Anatomy of Melancholy, tells us that "terrestrial devils are those lares, genii, fauns, satyrs, wood-nymphs, foliots, fairies, Robin Goodfellows, trulli, &c. which, as they are most conversant with men, so they do them much harm. These are they that dance on heaths and ftreens, as Lavater thinks with Trithemius, and as Olaus Magnus adds, leave that green circle which we commonly find in plain fields. They are sometimes seen by old women and children. Hieron. Pauli, in his description of the city of Bercino, in Spain, relates how they have been familiarly seen near that town, about fountains and hills. "Sometimes," saith Trithemius, "they lead simple people into the recesses of the mountains, andshew them wonderful sights, &.c." Giraldus Cambrensis gives instance of a monk of Wales that was so deluded. Paracelsus reckons up many places in Germany where they do usually walk about in little coats, some two feet long. — See Anatomy of Melancholy, 15th ed. p. 124.]`

Mr. Puck himself, as it was very well known at the time, used frequently to hold his court, and lead his midnight revels on a spot by the sea-side not above a mile from his house. It was a wild uncultivated place, covered with rocks, and bogs, and holes, and briers. It was generally known when he was at home by a small light being seen dancing about at midnight over the rough ground. This the neighbours used to call "Friar Rush's lantern," or "Puck's little star": the latter name, however, was the most common.

Amidst all this wilderness of rocks, bogs, and briers, there was, however, one place where the turf was extremely smooth and level; and persons passing that way by daylight used to observe those circular marks in the grass, which are everywhere known by the name of fairy rings.

One day a neighbour of John Kann's said to him, "John, I am going to build myself a house. Come, and I will show you where. It is the prettiest loveliest spot that ever was seen?"

Where do you think he took him to? To the very place where the grass was so smooth and soft, and where the fairy rings were always seen.

"Gracious me!" said John Kann. "You are not going to build here! Are you not afraid of Puck's little star? By St. Radegund you are making a fool of me!" `[St. Radegund appears to have been the patroness saint of Whitewell. There was anciently a chapel dedicated to her there.]`

"I'm not making a fool of you at all," said he; "but, the fact is, now that I am going to be married, I must get a house of my own to live in; besides, this would be a nice healthy place for the children when they come."

"But ain't you afraid of Puck?"

"Not at all," he answered. "Puck never hurts an honest industrious fellow like me. We have always been very good friends, and I have no doubt but that we shall continue so."

"And whom do you suppose the land belongs to?" asked John Kann.

"Why, it's just waste land, and is of no use to anybody; and the manor belongs to the Lisle family. They would never grudge a poor man's building a cottage there."

"That spot," said John Kann, "no more belongs to the Lisles than it belongs to me. It belongs to Mr. Puck; and, you think it would be a nice place for your children, do you? Do you know what happens to children that are born on fairy ground?"

"No."

"Why, then, I will just tell you. The fairies give them gin to prevent them growing any bigger, and then carry them off, and put an old wizen fairy in their place. I have known the thing happen often and often before. That child of Sukey Grundle's, you know, that was always crying and squealing, that was never her child at all, but just an old fairy. Her own little darling is no doubt at this moment doing the dirty work for some of the queer creatures in Fairy-land, scrubbing, and dusting, and slaving, and feeding their pigs, and, no doubt, getting a whop on the head every now and then with a broomstick; and, I will tell you what; it's of no use your settling here, just for the purpose of providing for your family by getting your children apprenticed out to the fairies. It's no saving at all, for they always leave one of their own sort, that eats twice as much, and is, besides, very mischievous, in its place. You had better not interfere with Puck's little star."

Well, John Kann's neighbour took his advice; and, moreover, asked John to his wedding-feast, which took place a day or two afterwards. John passed a very merry evening; and it was late and very dark before he started to return home. There were no roads in this part of the island in those days; so finding one's way home at night was not always an easy matter. Luckily, however, for John, a friend of his, who lived near, had started just before with a lantern, and John followed the light, which was some way on before him, singing to himself as he went along.

Up-hill and down-hill, over rough and smooth, John Kann followed the light: but, somehow or other he did not recognise any part of the road as he went along. "Maybe the ale was strong, and I am a little fuddled like, though I do not feel so," thought he to himself. "Maybe, all this time I have been following a wrong person with a lantern." However, it was of no use stopping then, as he did not at all know where he was; so he followed on, and on, and on. The ground grew rougher, sometimes up-hill, sometimes downhill, amongst brambles, and rocks, and holes, but there was a firm good path under his feet all the while. When, all of a sudden a new idea flashed across his mind. "Maybe it 's Puck's little star that I have been walking after all this while. What fun!" thought he to himself.

At length the light seemed to stand still, and John Kann walked up to it. However, as he came nearer, the light seemed to grow paler and smaller; and, when he got close to it, it was no bigger or brighter than a glow-worm's tail, so he was left all in the dark; but just then the moon glided out from behind a cloud, and showed him that he was on the very spot where the grass was smooth, and the fairy rings were, and where his neighbour wanted to have built his house.

As he stood still he thought he heard the sound of music, and a multitude of tiny voices singing together in chorus. He held his breath, and listened. He could clearly distinguish the following words,

"John Kann— John Kann  
Is a very nice man:  
He's a very nice man,  
John Kann."

He looked about for some time to see whence the voices came. At length he saw down on the ground just before him a great number of very small little people dancing hand in hand round a ring, with red and purple caps upon their heads, and little petticoats and cloaks, that looked as if they were made of gossamer. They all looked so faint in the moonlight that he thought at first it had only been the moon shining upon the stalks of grass as they waved in the wind. How lucky it was that he had heard them singing, or he might have walked on, and trod upon half a dozen of them.

While he stood there, looking at the dance, there came up to him one that looked like a very wee child of about five years of age, but his face seemed full of fun and mischief. As he came up to John all the fairies left off dancing, and stood hand in hand in a half circle round, bowing and courtesying to him, saying,

"Mr. Puck — Mr. Puck,  
Give John good luck.  
He 's come to see  
The revelry  
On the fairy lea,  
And to dance on his toe,  
As round we go.  
As round we go."

"I don't see how I can manage to dance with you," said John, "without treading upon a good many of you, and crushing you to pieces; for you see I am at least twice as big as all of you put together."

Here little Master Puck put in his word.

"John Kann — John Kann,  
You great big man,  
Though broad and tall.  
We'll make you small,  
If you'll dance with me  
On the fairy lea.  
There's dust on the feni —  
The lady's fern,  
That waves o'er the burn.  
Brown stripes are seen  
On its leaves of green.  
Go. Fetch."

Upon which six little fairies flew away; for they had all a sort of butterfly wings growing out from behind their shoulders, which John Kann had not observed before. After a short time they returned, each bringing in his hand a small acorn-cup full of a brown powder, looking very like snuff. Mr. Puck took a pinch of it; and, walking up to John Kann, said,

"Now — now  
I'll shew you how  
We make the tall  
Grow small.
Sit down  
Upon the groun'  
John Kann,  
You tall man."

John Kann nodded assent, and squatted himself upon the turf without more ado. Puck immediately climbed up on his knee, and then reaching up as high as he could, he caught hold of the lowest button of John's waistcoat, and then scrambled up a little higher. At length he got one of his feet firmly planted upon the edge of his waistcoat-pocket, and resting the other upon one of his buttons, he said,

"Stoop, Mr. Kann,  
You tall man."

John bowed his head as he was directed, and Puck immediately crammed some of the dust up his nostrils. John Kann gave a loud sneeze, so violent, indeed, that it shook his hat clean off his head, to John's great dismay, for he thought he must have crushed to death at least a dozen of his little friends. However, they all got out of the way quicker than thought; and, standing in a wide circle round him, they set up a loud shout the moment they heard him sneeze,and kept on cheering for some time. But, what was the most wonderful part of the whole, it seemed to him that the moment he sneezed he grew considerably smaller, shorter, and thinner; yet, as his clothes fitted him just as close, they must have grown smaller at the same time.

Mr. Puck administered another pinch of the powder. John Kann sneezed again, and instantly became a size smaller. The fairies setup another shout, hurrahing like wild things. Another pinch — another hurrah, — John had got again a size smaller. This was repeated until John Kann, had become a little thing, like his neighbours; upon which he said to his friend Puck,

"Please, Mr. Puck, don't make me any smaller, or I shall grow into nothing at all, or I might run a dangerous risk of being eaten up by accident by a field-mouse."

To which Mr. Puck answered,

"That will do  
For you — for you.  
Now we 'll dance.  
And hop and prance  
With John Kann,  
The little man."

They immediately prepared for a dance round the ring, and a tiny piper seated himself cross-legged upon the top of a mushroom, and began playing a lively tune. Here there appeared to be a great scramble who should dance next to John Kann, and take his hand. But Mr. Puck soon bustled up, and set matters to rights, and they began their dance. It was curious they did not the first time form a complete circle, but the string of fairy-dancers only reached half round. They footed so many steps one way, and then so many steps the other, and then cut a sort of caper before, and then another caper behind. This they repeated a great many times, singing something in chorus which John Kann did not understand. But, the reason that they did not dance the whole circle appears to me to be more curious than anything else. It was John Kann's hat, — for, the hat having been jogged off before the brown powder had taken effect upon John, it had never been reduced in size at all, like the rest of John's clothes. The next dance, however, they changed the place, and danced the whole circle.

"I dare say, sir, that this is just the reason that one sees the fairy rings on the down not always completely round. A snail has been crawling about, or there has been something else that the fairies do not like to cross."

They had not danced long in the new circle before a little fairy came fluttering into the centre of the ring, pushing the dancers to the right and left, looking himself quite violet-colour in the face, probably from fear. He shouted as loud as he could, A rat! a rat! a rat!" Mr. Puck then shouted,

"To arms, fairies! to arms!  
No war's alarms  
Shall make us fear."

The dancers left their ring, and ran about in all directions in search of arms. Some provided themselves with spears formed of the reed stems of the grass, carefully breaking off the ear that the shaft might be more pointed; some seized the dry prickles of gorse, which they held in their hands like daggers; others provided themselves with the crooked thorns of the brier.

Scouts were sent out in all directions, and small parties of the most active fairies were ordered to advance, and form pickets indifferent directions. Then followed a few minutes of awful suspense. John Kann was terribly frightened, and he wished with all his heart, that he had never come near the fairy-ground, or become acquainted with Mr. Puck. He at first thought of hiding himself under his own hat. But, to his utter dismay there was not room enough to creep under, and he found that he was not near strong enough to lift up the brim. At length he found a stalk of ragwort, and he contrived to climb up nearly as high as the yellow flower on the top. But this was by no means a place of safety. What, thought he, could be more likely than that the rat should smell him out, and just bite off his leg, to see how he tasted: or the rat might pull him down; and begin nibbling at his head, till he had ate him all up, like a raddish.

To be eaten up by a lion or a tiger was, to be sure, a dreadful thing; but then there was something grand in the idea. It would be put in all the newspapers; and, no doubt an account of it would be engraved upon his tomb; and so his name be handed down to posterity. But, to think of having been snifted with brown powder till one was only a few inches high, and then to be nibbled up by a rat like a piece of toasted cheese. It was horrible! horrible! If the rat really did come that way, he considered his death as certain. No rat of any sense or taste would think of eating one of those flimsy gossamer fairies, when he could find a real bit of substantial flesh and blood. Besides, if he should prefer a fairy, they were so much more active, and would be sure to get out of the way. The fairies, too, knew all the footpaths, and nooks and corners, amongst the blades of grass. And, as for what Mr. Puck called his arms, whoever saw a more complete farce in his life. What would an old rat care for spears made of grass straw, or swords made of briar thorns. It was most ridiculous, and at the same time, most melancholy.

While John Kann was thus musing to himself, and lamenting his hard fate, he was suddenly roused by a great bustle among the fairies. The cause was evident:— one of the advanced-posts had been carried, and the picket had been driven in, and a number of fairies rushed back among the others, waving their arms above their heads, and shouting,

"He comes — he comes,  
Sound the alarm.  
With whiskers grey  
As long as my arm,"

"All's lost! all's lost," thought John Kann; and he contrived to squeeze himself a little higher up into the yellow flower of the ragwort, upon which he was perched.

Quite different was the conduct of Mr. Puck. John Kann, however, merely attributed his courage to the fact of his feeling conscious that he was not wholesome food for a rat. Mr. Puck flourished his truncheon above his head, and shouted,

"Spears to the front.  
Couch your spears.  
Tickle his nose  
When he appears:  
And poke his eye  
When he comes nigh;  
He'll sneeze and wink.  
And turn round, I think;  
And, here 's that  
For, the rat!"

Snapping his fingers as he repeated the last line.

"He's a fine little fellow," thought John Kann; "nevertheless, I heartily wish I was at home."

Presently the rat was seen approaching, bending the grass-blades to the right and left, as his huge carcass passed between them. What an awful state of suspense John Kann was in. Life and death seemed to hang upon a thread.

The rat came along very leisurely, without seeming at all to be aware that he was invading an enemy's territory. Neither did he appear to notice the fairies who were drawn up in battle array before him. At length, when two of the sharp points of the grass-stalks ran up his nostril, and one or two more went into his eye, he drew back a step or two, shook his head, and winked his eye. He then began to walk on again. The fairies were, if possible, this time still more courageous, and one of them, with his lance tipped with a gorse-prick, struck the rat full in the eye. The rat stepped back again, shook his head, and then, turning round, commenced his retreat. The light troops, armed with gorse pricks and briar thorns, now charged valiantly, hanging upon his flanks and rear, sticking the weapons into him with all their might and main.

The retreating enemy was pinched and pricked until he squealed again. His retreat was not very rapid, for numbers of the fairy army endeavoured with their utmost strength to hold him back by the tail.

The retreat of the rat, sir, I hold to have been very bad generalship; for, it is very well known that whenever a person falls in with fairies, spirits, or goblins of any sort, whatever may be the danger of going on, there is always much greater danger in turning back.

The generalship of Mr. Puck, however, seems to me to have been capital; for, with a very weak force he defeated a powerful enemy, repulsing his attack twice, and then forcing him to retreat in a disgraceful manner.

When the enemy had been fairly driven out of the neighbourhood, the fairy militia threw away their arms, and, taking off their redcaps, gave three little shrill cheers, as loud, however, as they could hollow. Their caps, you must know, were made of the flowers of the foxglove, which gave them a very knowing appearance. John Kann had had one put on him as soon as his head had grown small enough to fit it. When they had done cheering one of them cried,

"The night is fair,  
And the morning air  
Is swinging the blue harebells;  
And the moon's faint light.  
Of the waning night  
To the eye of the fairy tells."

The remainder of the fairies in full chorus continued,

"A court — a court!  
Our latest sport.  
Sing, faines, sing!  
Blow, south wind, blow;  
Grow, mushrooms, grow.  
All in a ring!  
And a mushroom broad  
In the middle sward.  
For Puck, the king.  
And, in midst of all  
A round puff-ball.  
For John's sitting."

Presently a warm air came up from the sea, and the circle round which they had been dancing, was dotted all along with little round white spots. These kept growing larger and larger. John Kann could plainly perceive that they were young mushrooms coming up. They grew, and they grew, and they grew. It was quite surprising to see how fast they rose out of the earth. Presently they began to spread out their table-shaped tops, and gradually displayed their slender stalks. While all this was going on round the ring a large catsup mushroom and a puff-ball were gradually swelling themselves out side by side in the middle.

John Kann observed all this with astonishment, and his curiosity was still more excited at the puff-ball, which was diligently puffing itself out.

"What's the puff-ball for?" said John Kann. "Why mayn't I sit upon a mushroom, like the rest of you?"

To which question he received for answer, —

"Your eye,  
By and by,  
Will tell you why."

Mr. Puck then hopped in merrily, and took his seat crosslegged upon the large catsup mushroom in the centre, and motioning John Kann to the puff-ball by his side, he said,

"Sit, John,  
The puff upon."

Which John Kann immediately did, while all the rest of Mr. Puck's courtiers took their seats upon the smaller and slenderer mushrooms that grew round the ring. Where the tops of these mushrooms had spread out flat, they squatted themselves cross-legged upon them; but where they were sugar-loaf shaped, they sat themselves upon the point, with their legs dangling down to the edge.

Puck now endeavoured to put as much solemnity as he could into his merry face, and then thus began,

"Fays, as I call, appear, appear!  
Where 's Primrose?" —  
"Here, Puck, here." —  
"Where have you and your party been.  
You were not at our ring-dance seen?" —  
"We have been wandering all the night.  
Frisking in the pale moonlight.  
Around the fire of the glowworm's tail.  
And waging war on the horned snail.  
We rode on the ripple of the stream.  
And we soothed the lover in his dream;  
We wove the vision so soft and bright,  
That he clasp'd his pillow in delight.  
We sought the couch of his lady love,  
And hover'd in the air above.  
You would have laugh'd. Sir Puck, to see  
How we tickled her fantasy.  
She oped her eyes with her sweetest grace.  
As though she look'd in her lover's face;  
Seem'd her inmost soul to lie

In the hidden depths of her deep dark eye.  
I knelt me down on her arching brow.  
And peep'd through her eye at her soul below;  
And then a smile, and then a frown,  
And then she turn'd her eyelids down;  
Bosom and face blush'd crimson red.  
And a long soft sigh from her bosom fled.  
The miser dream'd of his stolen gold;  
The shepherd has thought of his fleecy fold:  
And thence we came our Puck to see  
In his royal court on the fairy lea." —  
"Where's Cobweb and his Fairies three?"—  
"Here upon your right hand.  
We have been footing it over the sea,  
And footing it over the land.  
We flutter'd down the vale,  
And hover'd over the hill.  
And our tiny wings did sail  
Round every fairy rill.  
We met with Goodman Place,  
As he came half drunk from the fair,  
We tickled his jolly red face  
As we flew along through the air.  
We met in the shade of the hill  
With a honey-bee alone.  
Just where the fairy rill  
Is a moising* down the stone.  
Where the lady's fern is green.  
And the cowslips blooming fair.  
Where the kingcup gold is seen.  
And the violet scents the air.  
He had stolen the sweets from the bower  
That alone for us fairies grew.  
And from many a quivering flower  
Had shaken the morning dew.  
He was far from the poison-stings.  
And aid from his pirate crew,  
So we held him fast by his wings.  
And brought him here to you."

`* Moising, — from the verb to moise, or trickle down, whence we get the word moist, or moised. The other parts of the verb are, however, not yet obsolete in the Isle of Wight.`

Here there was a kind of buzzing and struggling heard among the long grass just by, and Cobweb's three assistants were seen dragging in by main force an unfortunate honey-bee. John Kann jumped down from his puff-ball, and ran to see the fun. As he went up close to the bee. Cobweb hollowed out,

"Take care of his sting,  
John Kann,  
Or he'll hurt your wing.  
My man."

"My wing!" said John Kann; "that's a good one!"

However, he just looked round for curiosity sake, to see what the fairy alluded to. Never was man before so astonished as John Kannwas when he saw two beautiful little pale rose-coloured butterfly-wings attached to his back, just behind his shoulders. "It's very funny," said he to himself. "I suppose they must be hooked on outside. They can never be fixed on my back, and me with my coat on the while." However, upon putting his hand behind, he felt that there were two holes in his coat, just big enough to let the wings come through.

Could he move his wings? Flip flap, flip flap — they worked beautifully.

Could he fly with them? He tried. Up he went into the air as light as a thistle-down.

Should he fly home at once? Dangerous — dangerous, thought he; there are such a terrible number of hawks about. So, aftertaking two or three spiral skimmings in the air, he alighted down again upon his own proper puff-ball.

He found the fairies busily employed preparing their supper from the honey and bee-bread that they had taken from their prisoner. They had scraped the bee-bread from the thighs of the bee, and were rolling them up into very small balls, somewhat smaller than the many-coloured sugarplums that pastry cooks sell under the name of fairies' eggs. This name, however, is derived from a vulgar error. Fairies never lay any eggs at all. But the very little round balls that are sometimes found where fairies have been dancing and enjoying themselves, and been suddenly disturbed, are their loaves of bread, and not their eggs.

Some others of Puck's attendants had emptied the bee's honey-bag into an acorn-cup, and were diluting it with dew-drops, which they brought one drop at a time, rolling about upon the shining flower-leaf of the buttercup. The little fellow that was acting the part of punch-maker was steadily at work, stirring up the mess with the long stamen of a honeysuckle, till he considered it sufficiently diluted for the taste of fairies. Having completed it to his satisfaction, he took off his foxglove cap, he made a bow to Mr. Puck, and another to his guest, John Kann.

"Upon my word," said John Kann, "you really do not mean that we are all to sup out of that one acorn-cup, and have nothing more than those wee wee pills to eat? Why, small as I am, I could eat twice as much as all of it put together myself."

To which Mr. Puck replied,

"As we cannot get more victuals.  
We must make the fairies little.;  
When we have become small  
The supper it will do for Fairies all,  
Grow small.  
John Kann remains taller:  
Dust him till he gets smaller."

Immediately the operation of throwing fine brown dust up Kann's nose was resumed, till he sneezed and sneezed, and grew smaller and smaller. At length, in consequence of his head diminishing in size, the foxglove cap that he wore slipped down over his face. A fairy by his side helped him to take it off, and to put on the flower of a blue harebell, which fitted his head to a T. Upon looking round,he perceived that all the fairies had changed their foxglove caps for bluebells, — their charms apparently having no power to reduce the size of real flowers, although they could vary their own statures at pleasure.

A very merry supper they had. Mr. Puck and his friends ate and drank, and danced and sung. It struck John Kann that many of them were getting a cup too much, and that Mr. Puck himself was beginning to be a little fuddled. However, before things went any farther, Mr. Puck nodded to a fairy that was standing close to him, with the long flower of a honeysuckle in his hand; upon which the fairy put the honeysuckle flower to his mouthy as if it had been a horn, and began trumpeting away upon it. John Kaiin could not say that the sound was exactly like a trumpet; but certainly it was more like a trumpet than anything else that he knew of. The moment the merry company heard the trumpet they left off feasting and singing, and became instantly silent, grave, and sober.

Mr. Puck then turned to John Kann, and said,

"Mr. John Kann,  
My little man,  
Though fairies like honey,  
Men like money.  
Is it not so?  
Is it not so?"

John Kann took off his harebell cap, made a bow, and said, "Just so."

Puck continued,

"The yellow gold,  
Fair to behold.  
Heavy in hand.  
Doth men command.  
Should you like such?  
Should you like such?"

John Kann here made another bow, and answered, "Very much. But the fact is," he continued, "my most worshipful little gentleman, if you were to give me all the gold in the world, I am not big enough or strong enough to carry more than one seven-shilling piece at the outside, — that is to say, unless it is your pleasure to make me tall again before you hand me over the money."

Mr. Puck got very fidgety at this ill-timed interruption, and kept waving his hand backwards and forwards in token of his royal impatience. When John Kann stopped, he continued,—-

"There is a spot that you may see  
When walking on the strand,  
Half the day beneath the sea,  
And half upon the land.  
You shall know when the morning sun  
Is shining fierce and bright.
Where the treasure must be won  
By the gold grains glistening bright.
The spot is marked by a stone  
Pierced right through and through.  
Talk not of this — go there alone,  
Or bid the treasure adieu."

John Kann here stood up again, and made another bow. Upon which Mr. Puck said,

"Puff-ball, turn brown—  
John Kann, sit down."

The puff-ball immediately began changing from its snow-white colour, as if it had been baking in an oven, and the outer skin became shrivelly all over, and when John Kann sat down again, it burst as if its covering had been no stronger than a cobweb, and immediately he was enveloped in a cloud of dust, which got into hiseyes and made them smart so, that for a long time he was completely blinded. When, by dint of rubbing and rubbing his eyes, he began to see a little again, he was surprised to find ail his fairy companions flown, and himself restored to his original size, sitting alone on the little level spot on the hill side, which has been described before. The sun was shining bright and clear.

"I will have a look for the gold, at any rate," thought he, "before I return home."

He descended the hill, and walked along the shore, as he had been directed. The tide was low, and the rays of the morning sun were reflected brightly on the wet sand. After a little search, he found alarge flint stone with a hole in it, lying by itself upon the level smooth sand. The sand thereabouts certainly did appear to glisten rather more than elsewhere; he took some up in his hand, and found a number of little bright grains amongst it.

This is gold, then," said he to himself, as he cut a caper in the air from .very joy. "What a lucky fellow I am! or, as my friend Mr. Puck would say,

"John Kann,
Lucky man!

It strikes me that, if I had lived in fairy society a little longer, I should have learned to talk poetry myself. But how am I to become possessed of all this gold without anybody else finding it out? — for Mr. Puck said particularly, that if anybody else found it out, there would be no more gold for me."

After turning the matter over in his mind for some time, he thought that his best plan would be to make a show of turning fisherman and collector of shells. So he bought a few lobster-pots, and set them about among the rocks in the neighbourhood, and kept a collection of ornamental shells in his window for sale; which was indeed a very poor trade in those days, whatever it may be now.

But whenever he went down to the sea side he took with him a small tub, in which he used to put sand and water, and then shake it about for some time, so that the grains of gold, being heavier than the sand, would collect together at the bottom. He used afterwards to cover the gold up with limpets and periwinkle-shells, and walk home.

Three or four times a year he used to take a trip to London to sellhis gold dust, and return to the island as rich as a Jew. The neighbours wondered how he made his lobster and shell trade turn out so profitably. However, nobody guessed at the fact.

Well, John Kann got richer and richer. At length he bethought himself of taking a wife to share his wealth and happiness. A rich man, as it is well known, has never much difficulty in procuring a helpmate, and John was a handsome man besides; so Betty Spooner shortly became Betty Kann. Betty, like the rest of her sex, was constantly harassed by that restless and troublesome demon curiosity. While there remained anything that she was not made fully acquainted with, she was quiet neither day nor night. She listened at keyholes, peeped into letters, cross-questioned everybody; sometimes pretending to know everything about an affair, by way of a trap to catch the unwary; or inventing a lie, by way of bait to fish for the fact with. It is but justice to her memory to say, that she did not take all this trouble and tell so many falsehoods for any selfish or interested purpose. On the contrary, she appeared to be actuated purely by public-spirited and philanthropic motives. If there was any story or bit of scandal that she thought would tend to the amusement or instruction of the neighbourhood, she endeavoured to become possessed of the treasure solely that she might distribute it among the world at large. As for keeping a thing to herself, she never had been known to do so selfish a thing in her life.

All the neighbourhood felt convinced that Betty Spooner had been induced to marry John Kann chiefly for the purpose of discovering the secret how he contrived to get richer and richer, while every one round him remained poor. However, it is quite certain that she refused a much better match to marry John Kann. Her husband was for a long time proof against all cross-questioning, notwithstanding which she contrived, bit by bit, to poke the whole secret out. But with great discretion, instead of making it known to all the neighbourhood, she only told it to three or four of her chief friends and gossips, under a promise of the strictest secrecy.

Notwithstanding all these precautions, when John Kann went to work a day or two afterwards, he found a number of persons there, busily washing the sand. They did indeed find a very few grains of gold at first starting; but ever since that time neither John Kann nor anybody else has thought it worth his while to wash the sand in Puckaster Cove.

Never marry a gossiping wife.
