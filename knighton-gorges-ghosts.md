# Knighton Gorges

Originally a well presented manor house, Knighton Gorges, just of the road from Newchurch that hangers left up the hill to the Down's road towards Ryde, is the location of a tragic tale that tells of an attempt to avoid the ruin that could be caused to a family by a case of *felo de se* — suicide. It was immortalised by Percy Stone in his *Legends and lays of the Wight*:

SIR TRISTRAM'S WEIRD (1721)

Sir Tristram Dillington, it is said, distraught by the death of his wife, committed suicide. His body was found by the steward, who, to make it appear a case of misadventure, placed it on his horse, which he drove into the Knighton pond. By this means he avoided the escheat as a suicide and preserved the property for the heir.

Through the leafless limbs that woo the sky  
The wind soughs sad and drear;  
The mists along the meadows he  
In the waning of the year.

At foot and head of the carven bed,  
Stirred by an icy breath,  
A flickering light the candles shed  
O'er the shadowy room of Death.

For a life has dawned and a life has set  
In the span of a winter's day:  
'The Lord hath given'—Chill hands have met-  
'The Lord hath taken away.'

Sir Tristram sits in his oaken chair  
And his heart is sore with pain;  
For the light of his eyes, his bride of a year,  
He never will see again.

'A life for a life,' quoth old Nurse Nan,  
And set the babe on his knee —  
What matters a child to a stricken man?  
Hence! take the brat with thee.

'Can an heir bring back the joy of my heart,  
Or the grasp of a cherished hand?  
Our lives, our ways, must lie apart.  
Hence! take him, I command.'

Sir Tristram has ordered his roadster stout,  
And ridden to London town.  
Perchance he thinks in a pleasure bout  
His sorrows he may drown.

He has ridden to Ryde and ferried him o'er  
To Portsmouth by the sea;  
And he curses Fate — for his heart is sore —  
Yet he follows Destiny.

Ah! evil the case of a stricken wight  
'Mid the toils of London town!  
Vain is the pigeon's restless flight  
When the hawks have marked him down.

In the gaming den, with cully and cheat,  
He stakes on the loaded dice.  
His head is aglow with a hellish heat,  
His heart is a heart of ice.

And ever the pieces melt away,  
And ever he sends for more.  
So night and day, by tainted play,  
They gather Sir Tristram's store.

Money, money, without delay,  
Runs the summons from London town;  
And the steward grieves, though he must obey,  
To see the oaks crash down.

The hawks they have plucked their pigeon bare  
— He owes that he cannot pay —  
And he casts about in his blank despair  
To find him a means and way.

Stark lie the slopes of the Knighton Down,  
With never a sign of tree:  
Sir Tristram hath ridden from London town —  
A ruined man is he.

He hath spurred him early and spurred him late  
And ferried the Solent sea,  
And entered the arch of the Knighton gate  
With 'Summon the reeve to me.'

The steward before Sir Tristram stands  
And speaks him bold and fair.  
'Hast taken full toll of the Knighton lands;  
Their slopes lie bleak and bare.

'There's naught in dale. There's naught on down,  
To raise the gold upon—'  
'Perdition! I'll to Newport town  
And speak with Lawyer John.'

Old Lawyer John, for those in need,  
Keeps house in Newport town.  
Upright and just in word and deed,  
A man of good renown.

Though bowed his frame with weight of years,  
His eye is keen and bright.  
His speech is blunt. No man he fears —  
The shrewdest brain in Wight.

Within his book-lined study dim  
He scans the dismal roll  
The Knighton Reeve hath rendered him  
Of all Sir Tristram's toll.

'The man will ruin home and land,  
Unmindful of his heir;  
All further calls we must withstand  
And nurse the rest with care.'

Sir Tristram hath mounted his horse once more  
And ridden by George's Down  
Till he be come to the lawyer's door  
In grey-hued Newport town.

'Rouse! Lawyer John' — he tirled the pin —  
'And open quick to me.  
Withdraw thy bolts. I would within,  
And instant speak with thee.

'Come, leave thy dim and dusty deeds,  
Put musty tomes away,  
And list to me. Here's that which needs  
Advice without delay.'

Grave Lawyer John beneath his brows  
Keen eyes Sir Tristram down.  
'What bodes this urgent haste and rouse—  
More news from London town?'

'My lands be bare, my debts be grave:  
This is my news for thee.  
The good red gold I needs must have  
— And that right speedily.

'So raise me gold on Knighton land;  
I question not the way.  
My name and honour they must stand  
— Who lose forsooth must pay.'

'Foul wrong to do and call it right,  
Doth but thy folly crown.  
Wouldst ruin house and home in Wight  
For rogues in London town?

'And hast forgot thy year-old bride  
At rest in Newchurch there?  
Call thou to mind her love, thy pride.  
Wouldst rob her child — thine heir?'

In thought his whole life passed before  
In one brief moment's span.  
Sir Tristram turned and passed the door-  
A shamed and humbled man.

The Dillingtons have ever borne  
A fair and spotless name.  
Better to die a death forlorn  
Than live and bear the shame.

The steward sits within his room  
And waits his lord's return.  
The hours beat out the strokes of doom,  
And low the candles burn.

He's reached his cloak — he's reached his cap,  
And lighted lanthorn dim.  
'Sir Tristram's met with some mishap,  
Needs I go search for him.'

In vain he sought till dawn of day  
Some trace of him to find;  
Then heard Red Sorrel's whickering neigh  
Borne down upon the wind.

'Woe's me! There's evil here,' he cried,  
And followed till he found  
The sorrel by his dead lord's side,  
Pawing the bloody ground.

Sir Tristram lay — a woeful sight,  
With gaping wound in breast —  
All stiff and stark, a paper tight  
Within his fingers press'd.

Whereon was writ for all to read  
Let none for this take blame.  
Mine was the sin. Mine is the deed  
To save an honoured name.'

'Cursed be women, wine, and play  
That brought the old name down.  
Ah! woe the day he rode away  
To cruel London town.'

He fetched him water from the brook  
And cleansed the bloody wound;  
Then from his hand the script he took  
And buried deep in ground.

'No trace of blood or wound must show  
How he hath met his end —  
That none the dreadful truth may know,  
Nan must the body tend.

'Else Christian rite he may not claim;  
Lands forfeit they'll declare.  
Grim shame will light upon his name  
And ruin on the heir.'

To saddle raised that burden dear  
— Red Sorrel love shall win —  
Then led him to the Knighton mere  
And urged the stallion in.

That none should doubt the happening,  
To make it doubly plain.  
Ere that he drove the good steed in,  
The girths he rent in twain.

So wisely well the news was spread  
That thus the tale went round.  
Sir Tristram had, by dark misled,  
In Knighton pool been drowned.

So name and lands this steward true  
Thus saved from cruel ban,  
And how Sir Tristram died none knew  
But he and old Nurse Nan.

Sir Tristram lies in Newchurch aisle —  
His sins and sufferings past —  
His body rests but there awhile;  
God rest his soul at last.

We are next to take notice of the manor of Knighton Gorges, on the ſouth ſide of Nunwell or Afſhey down. It received the additional name of Gorges from Ralph de Gorges, who married Elen the daughter and coheir of John de Morville, who poſſeſſed it after the conqueſt, and dicd 1n the fortieth

tieth year of king Henry the Third. He enjoyed the manor afterwards in her right; his ſon was

Sir Ralph de Gorges, whom we find to have held

three knight's fees in Enighton and elſewhere in the ſeventh of Edward the Third, and left only one daughter, who was poſſeſſed alſo of the ſaid knight's fees as held from the Counteſs in capite, in the eighthyear of the ſaid king. Dame Ellen de Gorges was married to Sir Theobald Ruſſel. His

fon, Sir Ralph Ruſſel, ſucceeded to Knighton,

whoſe fon, Sir Maurice, had an only ſon Thomas, who died without iſſue. The heirs general were John Hacket, fon cf one of the daughters of Sir Maurice Ruſſel, and two of her daughters, married to John Keneys, and Stephen Hatfield. It is enough to fay that Knighton fell to the ſhare of Hacket, in whoſe poſſeſſion it

was at the time of an inquiſition taken in the

ſeventeenth year of king Henry the Sixth. He had only two daughters, of which Joan was marri-

ed to Gilbert of Witcombe, in Somerſetſhire, with

whom he had Knighton, and a part of Woolverton in Bimbridge. In the fifth year of Elizabeth the deſcendant of Gilbert ſold Knighton and other lands in the iſland to Anthony Dillington, Eſq. of Poole, in Dorſetſhire, who enjoyed it for a long time. At laſt it devolved on the two coheireſſes of Sir Triſtram Dillington, Bart. by the ſurvivor

of whom it was bequeathed to Maurice Bocland,

Eſq. upon whoſe deceaſe it deſcended tothe family of the preſent poſſeſſor, George Maurice Biſſet, Eſq.

Taz manor houſe is an ancient building, but appears to have been conſtructed with much taſte and judgment; and great attention has been evidently pid to it, to preſerve its original beauty, in the various reparations which inevitably have been beſtowed upon it. In particular we may obſerve, that one part of the building is finely varie-

perhaps, are too numerous to afford pleaſure and delight to the eye; and that the windows in front are all latticed, and retain their antique pillars of ſtone for their preſent ſupporters. It is finely ſituated on the gentle riſing of a hill between ſome fine woods, but at a ſufficient diſtance to afford ſome very beautiful proſpects. |

Lancuripeor or Longbridge is a manor nor far from Newchurch, which, at the diffolution of religious houſes, after Whorwell monaſtery, to which it had been given, was extinct, came into the poſſeſſion of the Worſley family, and after coming into the hands of the Dillington

probably by purchase, has since been attached to the manor of Knighton, and conſidered as of the poſſeſſions of the lords of that manor.

The old manor house of Knighton was once one of the most considerable mansions in the island. It was built in the reign oif James I. on the site of a much older structure. Although the place is picturesque, and suitable for a ramble, it will be visited by the stranger chiefly on account of its associations. It was here that Legh Richmond had his first interview with Elizabeth Walbridge, "The Dairyman's Daughter," who was at that time a servant in the establishment. We gather from the correspondence of John Wilkes, a very pleasing idea of the genial and refined hospitality which pervaded here, when, during his visits to Mr. Fitzmaurice, he often found assembled the leading gentry of the island, together with David Garrick, Mrs. Garrick, Sir Richard Worsley, and a number of foreigners.

Like many other mansions Knighton was reported to be haunted; but the exact nature of the unearthly visitant is not stated, though it was said to intimate its whereabout by a noise resembling the clanking of heavy chains. In later times, however, this noise was confined to one room, which was never opened, and over its entrance was inscribed a Latin legend of such mystic power as to prevent the egress of the troubled spirit. There is a strange story current respecting the death of the last male of the Diliington family, who for many years possessed the manor and house of Knighton. Sir Tristram Dillington lost his wife and all his children in rapid succession, and finally he fell himself by his own hand through despair, leaving two sisters, who afterwards died single. To prevent the forfeiture of the estate by the suicide of his master, the steward directly he became aware of the tragedy, took the horse his master usually rode, and having reversed the saddle, drove it into the mill-pond close to the house. This countenanced a report which he immediately spread, that Sir Tristram, returning home late at night, inadvertently rode into the pond, and through the slackness of the saddlegirth fell from his horse and was drowned before assistance could be rendered. This occurred at least a century ago. It was easy to avoid an inquest, and the stratagem succeeded. The shadowy form of Sir Tristram is said to be seen sometimes wandering over the deserted terraced gardens of his demolished mansion holding his head in his hand.

Legh Richmond says: "The house was a large and venerable mansion. It stood in a beautiful valley at the foot of a high hilL It was embowered in fine woods, which were interspersed in every direction with rising, falling, and swelling ground. The manor house had evidently descended through a long line of ancestry from a distant period of time. The Gothic character of its original architecture was still preserved in the latticed windows, adorned with carved divisions and pillars of stonework. Several pointed terminations also, in the construction of the roof, according to the custom of our forefathers, fully corresponded with the general features of the building. One end of the house was entirely clothed with the thick foliage of an immense ivy, which climbed beyond customary limits, and embraced a lofty chimney up to its very summit. Such a tree seemed congenial to the walls that supported it, and conspired with the antique fashion of the place to carry imagination back to the days of our ancestors."

Knighton is sometimes spoken of as "Knighton-Gorges." It was held in the reign of Henry III. by John de Morville, and received the appellation of "Gorges" from Ralph de Gorges, who married a daughter of Morville.

> Legend says that a man visiting the island on New Years Eve was nearly run over by a horse and carriage while walking towards Newchurch. Frustrated, he followed the carriage to a house and knocked angrily on the door hoping to speak to someone about the reckless driver. Despite his consistent banging, the party inside was so loud that no one could hear him. The man looked in the window and saw people in Georgian clothing too busy dancing, laughing, and enjoying themselves to pay any attention to the door. Assuming the strange clothing meant the guests were having a fancy dress themed New Years party, the man left annoyed and continued on to Newchurch. After finding a place to stay, he mentioned the rude coach driver and the raging party to his hosts who asked the man to show them the location of the house on a map. When he did they were surprised to find that the house he spoke of was Knighton Gorges, which they informed him was destroyed quite a long time ago.

> Isle of Wight based writer Ethel Hargrove witnessed the legend first-hand on New Years Eve 1915 when she stood with her friend staring in disbelief as Knighton Gorges, which had been gone for nearly 100 years, appeared as if it had never been destroyed. Hargrove spoke of illuminated windows, phantom party guests arriving in eighteenth-century attire, and dancing to the voice of a spectral singer. Since then, countless other witnesses have claimed to stumble upon a similar sight on New Years Eve.

HISTORICAL NOTES ON THE MANOR OF KNIGHTON, IN THE ISLE OF WIGHT.
By the REV. R. G. DAVIS.

Conspicuous by its height, and rendered more conspicuous by the triangular sea-mark on its summit, stands not far from Brading, on the eastern side of the Isle of Wight, the precipitous chalk hill known as Ashey Down. So precipitous is the descent on the southern side, that in the distance of a short mile and a half the road descends from the summit, which is 404 feet above the sea level, down into the marshy vale of Newchurch. Rather more than half way down the slope, nestling in the natural bosom of the hill side is the site of the old Manor House of Knighton, once by far the finest of the Manor Houses of the Island. It was visited in 1816 by Sir Henry Englefield, who in his work on the antiquities of the Isle of Wight, speaks of it "as the most considerable and beautiful of the antient mansions of the Island." The house has since that date been destroyed, and little of it remains save the foundations. The stone piers of the entrance gate still stand in their original position, and on them can be traced the coat of arms granted to Robert Dillington, of Knighton Gorges, in 1599; gules, a lion salient or. The principal front of the house was to the north. At the north-east angle was a square tower of great strength, in whose foundations was a dungeon of considerable depth. To the west was the garden, and at a little distance to the north at the foot of the hill, where there is now a stable, formerly stood the
chapel.

Knighton, under its original name of Cheniston, is stated in Domesday Book, to be amongst the possessions of the King, into whose hands it came by the forfeiture, through treason, of the Island by Roger de Breteville, Earl of Hereford, son and successor of William FitzOsborne, whom William the Conqueror had made Lord of the Island. There are to be found also in Domesday the names of the Saxon holders who held land in Knighton in the time of Edward the Confessor. Nothing is known about them but their names, Oda, Alwould, Herould, Godwin, Alric, and Brictric. The Domesday Book also tells that at Knighton there was a water mill, and that too in the days of King Edward. Through all the changes of English history did this water mill survive. It was here when the Conqueror came; when men went to the crusades in the holy land.

Century after century passed by yet did not stop the whirling of the water mill at Knighton. To-day that water mill is silent. The new replaces the old; the mill has been removed to make way for the Ryde Corporation Water Works.

After the account in Domesday, the first record we have of Knighton is in the reign of Henry III., about the year 1256. At that time it was in the possession of John de Morville. His ancestor William de Morville, had been one of the witnesses to the Charter for the foundation of Quarr Abbey in the 7th year of Henry II., 1161. Very probably he had obtained a grant of Knighton from the crown, and he would undoubtedly be one of the leading noblemen of the Isle of Wight. John de Morville died in 1256, leaving an heiress, his only daughter Elena. She married Ralph de Gorges, a member of a considerable family in the county of Cumberland. From Ralph de Gorges, Knighton received the appellation of Gorges. Ralph de Gorges had born to him a son whose name was also Ralph. Ralph the father died in 1272, and his wife Elena must have survived him for nearly twenty years. In the Rolls of the 20th year of Edward I., that is in 1292, it is recorded that the King has received the homage of Ralph de Gorges son and heir of Elena de Gorges, deceased. Oglander records in his memoirs of this family that "they weare a verie awntient famelye, and lived there verie well; they had theyre chappell, and there, weare manie of them buryed, and had fayre monumentes; ye chappell is nowe tourned to a brewhowse and ye churchyarde to an orchard. They had a parke there on ye weste syde of ye howse, and ye village wase called Knyghtes Towne, or Knyghton nowe, and ye howse, Knyghton Gorges." `[glander Memoirs, page 83.]`

Ralph de Gorges the second had an only daughter, Eleanor; and so again Knighton Gorges passed into the hands of an heiress. She married Sir Theobald Russell, lord of Yaverland. Shortly after his accession, Edward the third asserted his claim to the crown of France in opposition to his cousin Philip of Valois. Edward invaded France and the French retaliated by invading the Isle of Wight. One day towards the end of the year 1340, the watchman in the old watch tower at S t Helens, saw the French fleet coming across the channel. So he lit his watch fire and the news spread from one end of the Island to the other. Up trooped the men of the Island from the valley of Godshill, the wooded dells of Wootton and Osborne; the hardy fishermen of Brading and Yarmouth, and the soldiers from the castle of Carisbrooke.

At their head was the brave Sir Theobald Russell, lord of Yaverland and Knighton Gorges. In the meanwhile the French had landed from their ships and in the groves of Nunwell the invaders and defenders met. Long and sanguinary was the fray, but at last the French were repulsed and the men of the Island drove them into the sea with great slaughter. At the moment of victory Sir Theobald Russell fell mortally wounded. He was borne to his home at Knighton, where in the midst of the rejoicings of victory the gallant leader died.

Sir Theobald and Lady Eleanor left an only son who assumed his mothers' maiden name of de Gorges, and became Sir Ralph de Gorges, of Knighton. His son was a Sir Maurice, who was succeeded by his son Sir Thomas who died without issue. One of the daughters of Sir Maurice had married a gentleman of the name of Hacket, whose son John Hacket succeeded to Knighton, as appears by an inquisition taken in the 17th year of Henry the sixth. He also possessed Woolverton, Milton, and other estates in the Island.

On dying he left two daughters, Joan and Agnes. Joan married one Gilbert, of Witcombe, in Somersetshire, to whom she brought Knighton as her portion. The Manor remained in the family of Gilbert till the fifth year of the reign of Queen Elizabeth, 1565. Thomas Gilbert, of Witcombe, in that year sold Knighton to Antony Dillington, of Poole, in Dorsetshire. Along with Knighton the Dillington family also purchased portions of Milton, Woolverton in Bembridge, and the manor of Clevelands in the parish of Newchurch. These latter Antony Dillington sold to Sir Robert Worsley. As the Gilbert family, though owners of Knighton are always spoken of as of Witcombe, it is very probable that they seldom or never visited Knighton. The old manor house that had been the residence of the de Morvilles, of the Gorges, and of Sir Theobald Russell had fallen into decay. Antony Dillington rebuilt the house incorporating in his new building portions of the old house. Amongst them was a room known as "The Room of Tears;" and it is stated that this name was carved in curious letters over the door. To this room was borne Sir Theobald Russell when he was wounded at Nunwell, and in this room he died. Here his body was laid out in state, and for days his soldiers came to look on the face of their dead leader. To this room his widow Dionysia Lady de Gorges returned after the funeral and not long after in this room she also died of a broken heart. A tradition exists even to this day that after this twofold death the "Room of Tears" was haunted, and that from time to time sweet music could be heard floating around the scene of the two-fold death.

Anthony Dillington left Knighton to his son Robert, who was created a Baronet by James the First. From him the Manor descended to his grandson, Sir Robert, who married Jane Freke, of Iwerne Courtney, Co. Dorset. He died in May, 1689 without issue and was succeeded by his brother Sir John, who died in March 1705, unmarried. During the time of the first Baronet the Dillingtons became one of the most powerful familes in the Isle of Wight. They were renowned for their beauty, their extravagance and their wild blood. Old Sir John Oglander says that "Sir Robert Dyllington (next to Mr. Thomas Woorseley) wase one of ye compleatest gentlemen in owre Island, and it wase a pittie he had no issue, that his good parts might haue descended. If I may speak without partiallitie, I verylie bleeve that ye Isle of Wyght nevor bfedd so fine a gentleman as Sir Robert Dyllington (the sonn of Anthonie) wase; he wase as handsome, well complexioned as you coold wisch; he wase a1 good, not greate travilor and schollar; he had his Latine, ffrench, Spanisch, and Italion tounge he hadd; he wase very honest, stout and valiant; but above all his sweete', noble, merry carridge; as full of conceypts without offense; verie liberol to his ffryndes." `[Oglander Memoirs, page 128.]`

Of another Robert Dillington, the descendent of a younger son, old Sir John does not speak in such favorable terms.

The second Sir Robert Dillington was one of the members for the Borough of Newport in the Parliament of 1678, and was twice married.

The third Sir Robert was succeeded by his half brother Sir Tristram Dillington. He left an only child Judith D'yonesia' Dyllington. The wild blood of the Dillingtons appears to have found its climax in Sir Tristram. He is said to have driven eight horses attached to his carriage, and that mounted on his favorite charger "Thunderbolt" he would ride furiously down Knighton Shute, and through the gates up to the house. Of his daughter Judith Dyonesia there is still in existence a portrait. If the painter has not nattered her, Judith must have been a remarkably handsome woman.

Tradition states that Sir Tristram Dillington came to his death by suicide. In a very short space of time he saw die his wife and all his children, excepting only the daughter Judith. Dark despair seized him, and with a pistol he put an end to his life. At this time a law was in existence in virtue of which the Crown became possessed of the property of a suicide. When the sad deed was discovered the Steward to prevent the forfeiture of the estate, placed his master's body on his favorite horse and drove him into the pond below the house. It was then reported that Sir Tristram returning home late on a dark night, had lost his way, ridden into the pond and falling from his horse was drowned. In the Dillington Chantry in the church at Newchurch, are on the floor a series of dark stone tombstones bearing the names of various members of the Dyllington family. Amongst them one has on it the name of Sir Tristram Dyllington. Yet amongst the traditions that gather around old Knighton House, it is stated, that though the stone bears his name, Sir Tristram's body was never buried there. He had committed suicide, and though the fact might be hidden to save the property, it would appear to have debarred him from Christian burial. How far this tradition may be true cannot be told, but a few years since, the skeleton of a man of large stature was found in the walled garden to the west of Knighton House. Sir Tristram's estates finally devolved on his two sisters, Hannah and Mary. Hannah died intestate and Mary left the Manor of Knighton by will to her nephew Maurice Bocland. The second Sir Robert Dyllington had left by his second wife a daughter Mabella, who married into the Bocland family. Her son Maurice who was born in 1695 became a Lieutenant General in the Army in 1758, and was twice member of Parliament for Yarmouth, I.W. and once for Lymington. At his death in 1765, he left two daughters, Jane and Lucy. Jane married the Rev. Alexander Bisset of Dublin, and left two sons of whom George became owner of Knighton. In the year 1823, he sold the Manor and estates to Sir Samuel Spicer, from whom they descended to their present owner, Edward Carter, Esq. Maurice George Bisset about 1820, pulled down the Old Manor House.

Early in this century, when the old Manor was in all its glory, it had been visited by Sir Henry Englefield. In his Description of the Isle of Wight, he has left us both a view of the house as also a very beautiful description of its appearance. But in addition to the view published in the Description, Sir Henry Englefield has left a drawing of the house in his original sketch book, now in the possession of Dr. Groves of Carisbrooke, and hitherto unpublished.

The following description of the house is from the pen of Sir Henry Englefield. `[There is a general view of Knighton, the seat of G. Maurice Bisset, Esq. in Worsley's History, and a picturesque sketch of the house by Sir Henry Englefield is reproduced in Mr. Percy Stone's book. Also a painting in the possession of Mr. Edward Carter, the present owner of Knighton.]`

Knighton the residence of G. Maurice Bisset, Esqre. is by far the most considerable and beautiful of the ancient mansions of the Island. It is an irregular edifice, situated on the southern slope of Ashey Down, and surrounded, except to the south by noble groves which clothe the steep slopes of the hills, in the most picturesque manner possible. The ground falls with so quick a descent, that the southern front stands on an elevated terrace, partly formed into kitchen gardens on hanging levels, and partly in a ruder state, up which winds a carriage road leading to the offices. A most copious and crystalline spring rises in a small dell near the house, and is dammed up for the service ol a little mill so as to form a pretty pool, at the very foot of this ascent large trees overhang the water on either side amongst which the house attains quite a castle-like appearance. A very antient edifice, which was probably a chapel stands on the margin of the water, and before it was converted into offices must have added most essentially to the beauty of the scene. Even in its present state, it is no offensive object in the picture.

The principal part of.the house is to the north. It is of the age of Elizabeth, irregular and broken by projections. The windows are large and divided by stone mullions, square headed, and without any smaller arches in the angles of the lights; but their general form is very good, and the stone of which the whole house except the chimnies is built, is of an extremely fine gray tint. The west end of the house is completely enveloped in a mantle of ivy, which having closely invested the walls, winds lightly round a tall stack of clustered chimnies, and. embroiders with its deep green shoots, the glowing yellow of the antient mossy tiled roof. At the north eastern angle of the house there is a plain square tower of great strength and antiquity, in whose foundation a dungeon yet remains of considerable depth. Near this tower in the eastern front a part of a very handsome painted window yet remains; its style much resembles that of the windows in Arreton Church and the chapel at Swainston. The southern front has been to a degree modernised by the substitution of sash windows for the antient ones, but its colour is good and two great gables remain uninjured. The house contains several large and convenient rooms some of them have handsome wainscot, probably contemporary with the north front.

The drawing room on the first floor, is spacious and handsome, and entirely in this style. A long gallery, low and ill lighted, extends through the centre of the house under the roof, and in this is preserved, but with less care than so curious a fragment of antiquity deserves, a very large oaken chest covered with rich niche work, and tracery, of the age probably of Henry the fourth. It is but little injured and the original lock with tracery carved in iron, still remains.

No painted glass remains in the Windows, except one coat with the arms of Isabella de Fortibus, but this appears to be of a date much later than her time. The little building already mentioned, standing at the foot of the hill seems to be at least as old as the reign of Edward the third. One window alone remains in any tolerable preservation; the form and mouldings of this are uncommon.

KNIGHTON MANOR

Domesday Book tells us that at Knighton there is a water mill. Through all the changes of English history did the mill survive. To-day that mill is silent. The new replaces the old. The mill has been removed to make room for the Ryde Corporation Water Works. After the account in Domesday, the next record we have of Knighton is in the reign of Henry III, about the year 1256. It was then in the possession of John de Morville, whose ancestor, William, had been one of the witnesses to the charter for the foundation of Quarr Abbey in 1161, the 7th year of Henry II. John died in 1246 leaving an only daughter, Elena. She married Ralph de Gorges, and in the rolls of 1292 it is recorded that the King received the homage of Ralph de Gorges, son and heir of Elena de Gorges, deceased. Oglander records of this family, "they were a verie ancient famlie and lived there verie well. They had a chapel and were manie of them buried there and had fairs monuments, but ye cbapell is now a brewhouse and ye churchyard an orchard." Ralph de Gorges II had an only daughter, Eleanor, who married Sir Theobald Russell, Lord of TYaverland. Shortly after his accession, Edward the third asserted his cclaim to tbe crown of France in opposition to his cousin Philip of Valois. Edward invaded France and the Frenoh retaliated by invading the Isle of Wight. One day towards the end of the year 1340, the watchman in the old watch tower at St. Helen's saw the French fleet coming across the channel. So he lit his watch fire and tbe news spread from one end of the Island to the other. Up trooped the men of the Island from the valley of Godshill, the wooded dells of Wootton and Osborne; the hardy fishermen of Brading and Yarmouth, and the soldiers from the castle of Carisbrooke. At their head was the brave Sir Theobald Russell, lord of Yaverland and Knighton Gorges. In the meanwhile the French had landed from their ships, and in the groves of Nunwell the invaders and defenders met. Long and sanguinary was the fray, but at last the French were repulsed and the men of the Island drove them into the sea with great slaughter. At the moment of victory Sir Theobald Russell fell mortally wounded. He was borne to his home at Knighton, where, in the midst of the rejoicings of victory, tbe gallant leader died. Sir Theobald left an only son, who again assumed his mother's name, de Gorges. Failing male heirs the manor paused to one Gilbert of Wilcombe, Somersetshire. It remained with the Gilbert's till the fifth year of the reign of Elizabeth, when Thomas Gilbert sold Knighton to Anthony Dillington, of Poole, who rebuilt tbe manor house incorporating in his new house portions of the old building. Amongst them was a room known as "The room of tsars," and it stated that this name was carved in curious letters over the door. To this room was borne Sir Theobald Russell when he was wounded at Nunwell, and in this room he died. Here his body was laid out in state, and for days his soldiers came to look on the face of their dead leader. To this room his widow Dionysia Lady de Gorges returned after the funeral, and not long after in this room she died of a broken heart. A tradition exists even to this day that after this twofold death the "Room of Tsars" was haunted, and that from time to time sweet music could be heard floating around the scene of the twofold death. The Dillingtons became one of tho most popular families in the Island. The last Dillington, Sir Tristram, committed suicide. In a very short time he saw his wife and all his children die except a daughter, Judith. In a fit of despair he shot himself with a pistol. At this time by law the Crown became possessed of the property persona who committed suicide, and the steward placed his master's body on his favourite horse and drove him into the pond below the house. To conceal the suicide it was reported that Sir Tristram returning home late on a dark night had ridden into the pond and, falling from his horse, was drowned. From tha Dillingtons the estate passed to the Bocland family, and then to the Bissets, who sold the manor and estates to Sir Samuel Spicer from whom they descended to their present owner Mr E. Carter.— from *Papers of the Hampshire Field Club*.

Hampshire Post and Southsea Observer - Friday 03 January 1890


A ROMANCE OF THE ISLE OF WIGHT. MRS, A. C. Dicker, better known in the literary world as Miss Constance MacEwen, has just published s novel called "A Cavalier's Ladye: A Romance of the Isle of Wight," of which place, we understand, she is a resident. It is dedicated to Sir Richard Webster, the Attorney-General and Member for the Island, and assumes to be a sixteenth (seventeenth!) century romance in a nineteenth century dress. ... The manuscript, which is supposed to written in the form of a journal by Mistress Judith Dyonesia DYLLINGTON, was discovered in a strong metal box in the course of excavations, carried out "not long ago," where once stood the mansion of the Lords of Knighton Gorges. This is a somewhat stale expedient, and in the present case there is no apparent reason why concealment was necessary. The journal, which deals for the most part with the imprisonment of Charles I at Carisbrooke, is in no sense of an incriminatory nature; and even if it had been, the intimation at the end of the early restoration of the monarchy would imply that the time of danger for the cavalier party was past. We can only suppose that the intentions of the authoress became unconsciously changed as she proceeded, and that in the sequel the Besant element predominated over the Udolphian element. We are almost led to assume, in view of the difference of literary workmanship in the romantic and historical portions of the story, that two writers were employed upon the work. The heroine is the only daughter of Sir TRISTRAM DYLLINGTON, the head of a once powerful family in the Island, and a man of a strong and violent nature, He is represented as wearing mail, and as having a penchant for driving a team of eight horses to and from Newport. He is also the owner of a spirited charger named Thunderbolt. One night in September he was heard galloping home across Arreton Down at a breakneck pace, and soon afterwards his anxious wife was informed that the horse had carried him into the fish-pond and that he was drowned. The widow suspects foul play, and, after vainly attempting for tem years to unravel the mystery. she solemnly bequeaths to her daughter the duty of pursuing the investigation and dies. ... Spiritual influences reveal, or, rather, partly reveal, the mystery of Sir Tristram's untimely end. Knighton Gorges has a secret chamber, which once resounded with the sound of clashing armour, but which, after the ghosts had been exorcised by a priest, had ever since been the source of heavenly harmonies. After a visit to this chamber the heroine has a dream, in which she encounters her father on the Downs, and accompanies him to his self-inflicted death. Here, then, we have the solution of the problem, except as to the matter of motive. The reader is led to believe that impecuniosity—in spite of abundant evidences of wealth—was the real cause which led Sir Tristram to commit suicide, and it is only near the close of the narrative that we learn that he has an illegitimate son, and that it was in consequence of the latter's urgent demand for recognition which impelled the father to shoot himself. This son is the chief of a band of pirates who make Black Gang Chine their headquarters, and is the possessor of fabulous wealth in gold, silver, and precious stones, all of which are concealed in caves, in comparison with the wonders of which that of the Forty Thieves is as nothing. This amiable cut-throat is a sort of Mephistopheles in his way, and combines with his other virtues those of a virtuoso, a philosopher, and an electric battery. He abducts the heroine, well-knowing her to be his sister, and runs off with her lover, of whom we hear nothing more until the concluding chapters. With this episode the romantic portion of the story comes to an end ...

pp. 182-184

NOTES ON THE DE GORGES OF

KNIGHTON GORGES, ISLE OF WIGHT, A.D. 1241-1349.

THE knightly family of the De Gorges ranks among the most distinguished of the early nobility of the Isle of Wight. The site where the old Manor House of Knighton Gorges stood is to be found about midway on the steep southern slope of Ashey Down, one of a range of lofty chalk hills running through the centre of the Isle of Wight. The triangular sea-mark on its summit stands some 400 feet above sea-level.

An earlier family of repute — the De Morvilles — were located here by, or shortly

before, the commencement of Henry II.' 3.. reign. William de Morville it is conjectured, obtained a grant of the manor from the Crown, but no documentary evidence of such grant has been traced. His name is attached to two important island charters of 1150 and 1161. His descendant Ivo de Morville, Lord of Bradpole, co. Dorset, Wraxall, co. Somerset, and Knighton, Isle of Wight, died before 1256, the date usually assigned, leaving an only daughter Elena, heiress to his large estates. She married' Ralph, son of Ivo de Gorges of Tamworth,. co. Warwick.

Ralph (1) de Gorges. His marriage with, the heiress took place before 1241, both parties being probably under age. This surmise is based upon the following, entered on a Patent Roll, bearing date Jan 16 1241:—

"Appointment during pleasure of Bartholomew Peche and Joan de Gorges to the custody of the lands of Ralph de Gorges and Eleanor his wife."

Cal. Pat. R., 1232-47, p. 243.

(A reference to Joan de Gorges is found on the Liberate Rolls, May 7, 26 Henry III., Issues of the Exchequer: "Pay &c. to Joari' wife of Ralph de Gorges, 4 marks to purchase a rcbe and coat.")

In September of the following year is a mandate to the Archbishop of York, "to assign as soon as possible to Ralph de Gorges ten pounds yearly for the maintenance of him and his wife." — Cal. Pat. R., 1232-47, p. 323.

Wiff en, 'Historical Memoirs of the House of Russell,' i. 136, alludes to an earlier alliance of Ralph de Gorges with the heiress of Foliot of Warleigh, but cites no authority for the statement. This story is echoed later by the Rev. George S. Master, 'Collections for a Parochial History of Wraxall' n 10 published 1900:—

"Sir Ralph' de Gorges married for his first wife, Margaret, daughter and heir of Robert Foliot of 'Warleigh, in Tamerton Foliot, co. Devon and by her, who died in 1239, had issue, &c." The Foliot heiress did marry a Ralph de Gorges, but he was of Est Almere, co. Dorset, who is named later as one of the executors of the will of his namesake of Knighton Gorges, whose death took place circa 1272. A pedigree of the 'Gorges of Tamerton Foliot' is given in Pole's 'Devon' p. 335. Particulars of the inquisition following on the death in 1289 of "Ralph de Gorges de Almere" is given in the 'Calendar of Inquisitions,' ii. 462, published in 1906. He died, in 1289, sine prole, and his wife's name was Margaret, a daughter of Simon de Brionne, vel. Bryon.

A lengthened period elapses before any further allusion to Ralph is found in the public records, but that he might have been actively engaged during the interval may be inferred from the following : —

" 1253. Protection to Ralph de Gorges, Ralph

de Gorges, knt going with the King to

Gascony, for so long as they are in his service in those parts."— Cal. Pat. R., 1247-58, p. 231.

Sir Ralph was one of those attendant on the king when he was "blocked up," in the year 1263, by the disaffected citizens of Bristol. Collinson adds that : —

" He was a knight and great warrior, and was shortly afterwards made governor of Shirebourne and Exeter castles. A grant of 40 marks a year at the Exchequer was made to Ralph de Gorges in July, 1262, until the King provide for him more bountifully in wards and escheats." — Cal. Pat.R., 1258-66, p. 229.

Grave anxiety as to an invasion of the Isle of Wight by the French caused the king in the year 1267

"to appoint our beloved and faithful servants Ralph de Gorges, with others, to well and truly guard the aforesaid island." — Pat. R., 51 Henry III., m. 9d.

"In the year 1270," Sir Ralph "was signed with the Cross, in order for his journey to the Holy Land, where he attended and shared with Prince Edward the glories of the expedition." — Hoare, 'Hist, of Wilts.,' vols. ii.-iii. p. 29.

During, or shortly after his return from, the Crusade he died, leaving his widow with three others — Ralph de Gorges de Almere being one — executors of his will (e Rotulo Finium, 56 Henry III.). He left issue two sons, Ralph the eldest, and John, to whom a reference is made at the time of his mother's demise:—

"Feb. 5, 1291. Grant to John, son of Elena de Gorges, for the services of the said Elena to the King and late Queen in the guardianship of their children, the princesses Eleanor and Johanna, of a suitable marriage when one falls in." — Cal. Pat. R., 1281-92, p. 422.

Lady Elena survived her husband many years. Dying in 1291, the royal mandate to take possession of her lands bears the date Feb. 18, 20 Edward I. (Rot. Fin., m. 12). The inquisition was held the same year and the jurors say : —

"Radulphus de Gorges est filius et proximui hseres dictae Elenae, defuncti, et est setatis trigenta sexannorumetamplius." — Calend. Inq. p.m. (Rec Com., 1806), i. 109.

Ralph (2) de Gorges, Lord of Braunton, co. Devon, Bradpole, co. Dorset, Wraxall, co. Somerset, and Knighton, Isle of Wight, son and heir, succeeded his father, circa 1271 and his mother in 1291.

He is first mentioned in connexion with Isle of Wight records in a plaint relating to the levying of scutage in the eighth year of Edward I. This dispute with the Crown appears to have inherited from his father, upon whom an unjust distraint for a contribution to an aid for marrying the king's sldest daughter had been levied, 38-39 Henry III. (Worsley's 'Hist.,' p. 77).

He was a knight in 1285 ('Inq. and Ass. re Feudal Aids, Dorset,' ii. 34), and equalled lis father in military distinction, taking an active and prominent part in the wars of Edward I. An entry on the Close Rolls, 12 Edward I., gives the following notification bo the Exchequer:—

"That the King in return for his good service has pardoned Ralph de Gorges 24Z. in which he is indebted for the debts of Ralph de Gorges.his father, for the time when he was sheriff of Dorset."' —Cal. Cl. R., 1279-88, p. 260.

The nature of the service rendered is not specified. Other smaller amounts are remitted, from time to time, and would thus seem to suggest that Sir Ralph was a persona grata to the king.

From an entry on the Patent Rolls, June 24, 1287, it is evident Sir Ralph was actively engaged in the French wars, a protection order being granted him "going abroad with the King."

The death of his mother, Lady Elena, occurred early in the twentieth year of Edward I.'s reign, and Sir Ralph doing homage in March of that year had seisin of her estates (Rot. Fin., 20 Edw. I., m. 11). A protection order with clause volumus was granted, June 24, 1291, to him "staying in Scotland on the King's service until Christmas" (Cal. Pat. R.,m. 1). "He was," says Dugdale 'Baronage of England,' ii.-iii., 55, "Marshal of the King's army in Gascoigne, 21 Edward I.," and the following year he returned again to those parts, where he attained such favour from the king that the following grant was made him, in July 15, 1294, that going to Gascony on the King's service that if anything should happen to him, before his return, the exors. of his will shall have free administration of his lands and goods for 3 years after his death and also free administration of his mother's will, whereof he is said to be executor." — Cal. Pat. R., 1292-1301, m. 14.

Dugdale referring to the aforesaid grant writes:—

"But in that year, Charles, brother of the French King, invading Gascoigne with a great power laid siege to Risune, where John de Bretania was governor, who forsaking his charge, exposed those in the garrison to the mercy of the enemy, •-amongst which this Ralph being one, was carried prisoner to Paris."

Evidence is supplied in a Close Roll that Sir Ralph had already started in September -on his unfortunate expedition to France (Cal. CL R., 1288-96, p. 369). He died during his captivity abroad; the writ to the •escheator bears date Portsmouth, May 23. The text is found on the Fine Rolls (25 Edw. I., m. 13). A closing word "vacat" leads to an inference that the customary writ was issued in ignorance of the grant made to Sir Ralph in 1294, and was quashed later -when it was found, in consequence thereof, -that the king had no interest in Ralph's Elands. The year is given as 1296, but if the regnal year began on Nov. 16, the date is really May 24, 1297, and since the death took place in France it follows that Sir Ralph had been dead some little time on May 24.

Evidence of Sir Ralph's marriage is supplied in the following assignment of dower to his widow:—

"1297, June 27. These lands [in Essex] are assigned to Maud, late the wife of Ralph de Gorges, as her dower, for a third part of the lands that belonged to Ralph by the assent of the exors. of the will, &c." — Cal. Cl. R., 1296-1302, p. 114.

'The text of the foregoing deed is of more than ordinary importance, since it shows that a Ralph de Gorges had died in the year 1297, leaving a widow, surviving-dower being assigned from the de Gorges estates. Now this Ralph must be "the Marshal," Lord of Knighton Gorges, with wide estates over on the mainland, father of — not identical with — "Ralph, Baron Gorges," who died in 1325.

From the following excerpta it will be seen that Dugdale, with other writers, has confused two different personages, the dates given being also at variance with the true facts, since Ralph "the Marshal" died after March, 1295-96, and before May, 1297.

Collinson, 'Hist, of Somerset,' art. 'Wraxall,' pp. 156-8, writes : —

"Ralph de Gorges, son and heir of Ralph by Elena his wife, was a knight, and 21 Edward I. was Marshal of the King's army in Gascony."

He goes on to say:—

"2 Edward II., he was summoned to Parliament among the Barons and died Nov. 29> 17 Edward II., leaving issue by his wife Eleanor* <fcc."

G. E. C.'s 'Complete Peerage,' vol. iv., p. 54, art. 'Gorges,' has : —

"Ralph de Gorges, s. and h. of Ralph de Gorges, Gov. of the castles of Shirburn and Exeter and sometime -Sheriff of Devon, by Eleanor, dr. and h. of John Moreville of Wraxall, co. Som., succ. his father 1272. . . .and was summoned to Parl. as a Baron [Lord Gorges] by writ. He m. Eleanor, &c."

'The Victoria County History,' art. 'Knighton,' v. 182, says:—

"John or Ivo de Morville died in 1256, leaving a daughter and heir married to Ralph de Gorges. She died in 1291-92, leaving a son Ralph, who in 1305 leased the manor," &c. "The manor see ms to have reverted to Ralph before 1316. Ralph (afterwards Sir Ralph) and his wife Eleanor had one son Ralph, who died without issue, evidently before 1330-31."

NOTES ON THE DE GORGES OF

KNIGHTON GORGES,

ISLE OF WIGHT, A.D. 1241-1349.

(See ante, p. 182.)

RALPH ( 3 ^ de Gorges, son and heir of Ralph "the Marshal" and his wife Maud, succeeded to the family estates by May, 1296-97 (Rot. Fin., 25 Edw. I., m. 13). He served under his father in Gascony in the campaign 1294, and was probably taken prisoner with

him at Risuna, as will be shown later on in • references to the losses he and his father jointly sustained in that expedition. Evidence of his being still in captivity is shown in a protection order, bearing date April 2, 1299, "for Ralph de Gorges for as long as he emains a prisoner with the King of France" (Cal. Pat. R., 1292-1301, p. 402).

Dugdale says he was serving in Scotland the following year, but cites no authority for the statement, and in face of the foregoing excerpt it is probable he was still a prisoner and Dugdale's authority may be only a writ summoning him. He must, however, have 3een set at liberty soon afterwards since he was certainly present at the siege of Caerlaverock in 1300. Hoare says that he is celebrated by the minstrel as being one of the foremost chieftains who sat down with their chivalry before that noted fortress:—

There more than once the new-dubbed knight Sir Kalph de Gorges I saw, hemmed round." His long detention as a prisoner in France may have been the cause or reason of his late knighthood. It may be noted here that Wiffen, 'Russell Memoirs,' i. 137, identifies Ralph "the Marshal" in 1294 with Ralph at Caerlaverock in 1300, whereas the latter was the former's son.

By a fine (29 Edw. I., 1301) evidence is afforded of Sir Ralph being then married, a "Magister Thomas Gorges" granting certain manors and the advowson of a church, &c., in the county of Dorset "to Ralph de Gorges and Alionora his wife."

In the year 1305 the manor of Knighton Gorges was leased to William de Caleshale and his wife Cicely for the term of their lives (Inq. a.q.d., file 55, no. 20).

The claim advanced by Sir Ralph to be reimbursed for the losses he had sustained in the French wars in Gascony is now dealt with:—

"1308, May 4. To the treasurer and Barons of the Exchequer. Order to allow to Ralph de Gorges in the debts due from him, the arrears of the wages due to him and his father Ralph, for the time when they were in the late King's service in Gascony in the twenty-second year of his reign, and for the restitution of their horses, their loot, and also for the wool of his father seized for the use of the late King." — Cal. Pat. R., 1307-13. It appears from an entry made in the Close Rolls two years later that some difficulty was found in carrying out the order, "because they were not notified of the number and price of the said horses, &c." (Cal. Cl. R., 1307-13, p. 104, m. 26).

The foregoing notices are all important, as I have already pointed out, showing that the

pedigrees given in the peerages are an error,

.-since they make Ralph "the Marshal" in

' Gascony, 1294, and who died by or before

.May, 1296, > identical with Ralph, "Baron

•Gorges," who died later in 1324, and leaving,

with other issue, an only son Ralph, a minor,

«ged 15. It is also clear, from the foregoing,

'that Ralph "the Marshal" was, in 1294,

i accompanied by a son Ralph, then old

enough to take part in the campaign, who

must be identified with Ralph, Baron Gorges,

summoned to Parliament as a "Baron by

Writ from Mar. 4, 2 Edward II., 1309, to

• Sept. 18, 16 Edward II., 1322." Sir Harris Nicolas, 'Historic Peerage' (1857), adds

•further: " ob. 1323, leaving Ralph de Gorges his s. and h. set. 16, who was never summ. to Parl. and appears to have died s.p. ante 1400."

Evidence in the Close Rolls (Gal., 1307-13, p. 318) shows that Sir Ralph was with the king in Scotland in 1311, and in 1320 was of the party supporting the king against the faction headed by the Earl of Lancaster. In the same year he was a witness to a charter granted by the king to the burgesses of Bristol.

About this time Sir Ralph was chosen to

;hold the important office of Justiciary in Ireland. The particulars are entered on the Patent Rolls and involved "keeping the land of Ireland with its castles, receiving as long as he shall remain in that office 500?.

• a year" (Cal. Pat. R., 1321-24, p. 546, m. 7d). A protection order for three years

•was granted, "Mar. 28, 1321, for Thomas de Anne going with Ralph de Gorges "the elder "to Ireland on the king's service." It would, however, seem doubtful if Sir Ralph

• ever reached Ireland and took up the appointment for, apparently, when on his way thither he was turned aside and sent

: into Wales to oppose the Mortimer faction. He was there taken prisoner, and Matthew de Gorges in his company was killed. Confirmatory evidence of the foregoing is supplied in the following extract : —

" 1321, July 2. Grant to Ralph de Gorges taken prisoner while on the King's service and afterwards ransomed, of 500 marks." — Cal. Pat.B., 1321-24, m. 5, p. 596.

It would appear, from a later notice, that the ransom alluded to was never paid, or that Ralph was taken prisoner a second time. In December, 1321, an order was 'issued

" to Roger de Mortuo Mari of Wygenor to cause Ralph de Gorges to be released from the custody -wherein he holds him, or, to signify to the king 'the reason for not obeying this 'order."

Sir Ralph was probably released before Feb. 15, 1322-23, when he is commissioned to raise a thousand footmen in the counties of Somerset and Dorset; and later is further empowered "to raise double that number, five hundred to be armed" (Cal. Pat. R., 1321-24, pp. 73, 76). On the same Rolls (p. 188) is a notice that a protection order was granted to Ralph de Gorges going with Hugh le Despencer "the younger" with the king to Scotland.

Sir Ralph died in October, 17 Edward II., the writ — "ad diem suum clausit extremum" — is dated the 24th, the inquisition being held on Dec. 30 ('Calendar of Inquisitions,' publ. 1906, vol. vi., p. 299), and the jurors say "that Ralph, his son, aged 15 on the feast of St. Michael last, is the next heir." He left further three daughters, Elizabeth, Eleanor, and Joan. Lady Eleanor survived until 1349.

Of Ralph (4) de Gorges. He was born about Michaelmas, 1308. Collinson, 'Hist, of Somerset,' says "he left no issue." Hoare, 'Hist, of Wilts.,' p. 29, writes: "He soon followed his father to the grave, unwedded." G. E. C.'s 'Complete Peerage' states: "He died soon afterwards, a minor, and unmarried." The foregoing statements are more or less inaccurate, for Ralph was living in 1336, and was married, 4 Edw. III., to a lady Elizabeth, whose family name has not been traced. The marriage is evidenced to

"by a fine made in the year 1330, at Westminster, between Walter Waleys, querent, and Ralph de Gorges and Elizabeth his wife for the manor of Wroxhale and for the advowson of the church there, &c."- — Publ. Som. Rec. Soc., xii. 146.

The writer of the article 'Knighton' in the 'Victoria County History,' v. 182. errs in stating:—

"Ralph and his wife Eleanor had a son Ralph, who died without issue, evidently before 1330-31, when Sir Ralph settled the manor in tail-male on two younger sons of his daughter Eleanor who had married Theobald Russell of Yaverland. William, the elder of the two brothers, died s.p., and the manor (Knighton) was delivered to his brother and heir Theobald in 1343."

A query arises, was not this rather on the death of Ralph (4) de Gorges who was living in 1336, as shown in the following quit claim: "10 Edw. III., Feb. 27, 1336, by Ralph, son of Sir Ralph Gorges, to Sir John de Roches for lands in Bromley, &c." (Montagu Burrows, 'Brocas of Beaurepaire,' p. 349). The deed was witnessed to by Sirs Theobald Russel, Bartholomew de Insula, and John de Glamorgan, and was dated at Yaverland 'in the Isle of Wight.

Ralph died before 1346-47, for in that year Theobald Russel was sued by Elizabeth, widow of Ralph de Gorges "the younger," for the manor of Knighton. Judgment was given in her favour, but since she had no issue by Ralph, the manor reverted to Theobald, who was in possession in 1362 (Gal. 01. R., 36 Edw. III., m. 9, no. 14).

Descending the down, southward, we come, in a leafy gorge of singular beauty, upon the scanty relics of a mansion, once the most considerable in the island; the ancient manor-house of *Knighton Gorges*, built in the reign of James I. (on the site of a yet older building, the residence of the De Gorges). In the early part of the reign of George III. it belonged to Mr. Fitzmaurice, who assembled here the Georgian wits, Wilkes, David Garrick, Mrs. Garrick, and others.

"Like many other mansions, Knighton House," we are told, "was reported to be haunted; but the exact nature of the unearthly visitant is not stated, though it was said to intimate its whereabouts by a noise resembling the clanking of heavy chains. In later times, however, this noise was confined to one room, which was never opened; and above its entrance Avas inscribed a Latin legend of such potency as to prevent the troubled spirit's egress. There is a strange story current respecting the death of the last male of the Dillington family, who for many years possessed the manor and house of Knighton. The party alluded to, Sir Tristram Dillington, lost his wife and all his children in rapid succession, and finally fell himself by his own hand through despair — leaving two sisters, who afterwards died single. To prevent the forfeiture of the estate by the felo de se of his master, the steward, directly he became aware of the tragedy, took the horse his master usually rode, and having reversed the saddle, drove it into the mill-pond close to the house. This countenanced a report, which he immediately sj3read, that Sir Tristram, returning home late at night, inadvertently rode into the pond; and through the slackness of the saddle-girth fell from his horse, and was drowned before assistance could be rendered. This occurred at least a century ago. It was easy to avoid an inquest, and the stratagem succeeded" (Walks Round Ryde).

Legh Richmond describes the old house as a large and venerable mansion, standing in a beautiful valley at the foot of a high hill, and embowered in fine woods, which were interspersed in every direction with rising, falling, and swelling grounds. It had evidently descended through a long line of ancestry from a distant period of time. The Gothic character of its original architecture was still preserved in the latticed windows, adorned with carved divisions and pillars of stonework. Several pointed terminations also, in the construction of the roof, according to the custom of our forefathers, fully corresponded with the general features of the building. One end of the house was entirely clothed with the thick foliage of an immense ivy, which climbed beyond customary limits, and embraced a lofty

eliimiiey Tip to its very summit. Such a tree seemed congenial to the walls that supported it, and conspired with the antique fashion of the place to carry imagination back to the days of our ancestors."

It was here that Legh Eichmond first made the acquaintance of Elizabeth Wallbridge, the "Dairyman's Daughter," then a servant in the establishment.

The only remains of the old house are some garden- walls, grassgrown piles of masonry, and the entrance gates. In the immediate vicinity are a farm-house, a cottage, and a portion of the Ryde Water- works. Of these, however, the principal section is situated in the valley between Ashey and Brading Downs.
