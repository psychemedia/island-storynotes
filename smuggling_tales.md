ISLE OF WIGHT PETTY SESSIONS

COUNTY BENCH.

Saturday. — The county magistrates in attendance were Mr. T. Leach (chairman), Admiral Crozier, and Mr. B. T. Cotton.

Smuggling.— David Cotton, of Brighstone, fisherman, was chanced with being found at Puckaster Point, off Niton, on board the Cloud, a fishing smack, engaged in smuggling tubs of contraband spirits.— Mr. Robert Henderson, controller of Customs at Cowes conducted the case, and Mr. Douglas Ford, of Portsmouth, appeared for tbe prisoner.— Geo. French, chief boatman at St. Catherine's Point station, deposed that on the morning of Friday, tbe 5th instant, his attention was called to the movements of a small vessel making for the eastward. He, in company with Joseph Petty and two others, went off in a boat, and found tbe small vessel named the Cloud with her head to the north off Puckaster Point. He and Petty boarded the vessel, and found on board the bran new warp, fitted with slinks, which was now produced. This warp, with its fittings, was adapted for running tubs ashore. It was such as was generally used for that purpose, and it was adapted for no other purpose. The warp was wet, and part of it was in the hold and part up through the hatchway and across the deck. There was no such gear used for fishing. Prisoner was lying drunk and asleep across the hatchway, and, on being roused by witness, said, "I don't care; we've got the tubs ail right." Prisoner afterwards said that John Chambers, of Freshwater, was with him. The smack went to pieces on the rocks, and witness produced the board which was on the stern, with the name "Cloud, of Yarmouth," painted on it. — By Mr. D. Ford: Had been 18 years in the coastguard service. Had not been accustomed to trawling, but had seen trawling gear fitted up by fishermen on the shore many a time, and it was unlike the warp and fittings now produced. Stops were used in trawling, but the stops in question found in this little vessel were large enough for a vessel of 100 tons engaged in trawling. Prisoner was sober two hours after he was roused from his slumber. The owner of the Cloud, about ten tons, held a fishing license. There was not a strong wind on, only a ripple.— Joseph Petty, coastguard boatman at St. Catherine's station, residing at Wreath, corroborated the evidence given by the last witness. Part of the hatches were on and part off. A fishing net was found on board, but it was lying dry in the hold. The warp, with fittings, such as used for running tubs ashore, was wet. Prisoner was lyiug asleep on the comb of the hatchway, and about ten minutes afterwards he said the tubs were landed in the bay, and that he was from Alum Bay. There was no fish found on board. At that time the smack was in some danger of going to pieces on the rocks.— Thomas Hunter, of the coastguard station at Cowes, and James Hayman, chief boatman in charge of the station at Shanklin, gave evidence as to the warp, with slinging gear, found on board, to the effect that it was a device for slinging or running tubs.— Mr. D. Ford briefly addressed the bench on the defence set up that the gear found was adapted for trawling. He called Geo. Barter, of Portsmouth, 35 years a fisherman, who deposed that the gear in question was very much the same as that used for trawling on rocky ground. The number of stoppers (there were double and single ones) would be larger or smaller, according to the nature of the fishing ground.— Prisoner was fined £10 and the costs. He paid the money.

Another Man Charged with Smuggling.— John Chambers, of Yarmouth, fisherman, was charged with being on board the fishing smack Cloud, in company with prisoner in the foregoing case of smuggling, off Niton, on the morning of Friday, the 5th instant.— Mr. Douglas Ford appeared for the prisoner.— David Cotton, prisoner in tbe preceding case, and now a reluctant witness, admitted that prisoner was on board the smack Cloud, when she struck on the rock, on Friday, the 5th instant. Prisoner jumped into a boat in tow at the stern of the smack, and pulled away, but witness could not say in what direction.— Jas. Aldridge, of Shauklin coastguard station, apprehended prisoner on this charge, at Luccombe, on the morning of the 6th instant. Prisoner replied that he was the man. Prisoner's name was painted on a boat then at Luccombe.— Silas Kemp, of Luccombe, fisherman, was out fishing between 8 and 9 on the morning of the 5th instant, and saw prisoner's boat come into the boat haven there. Prisoner breakfasted at his house, and he, witness, showed him the way up the cliff. Prisoner was discharged.

Isle of Wight Journal - Saturday 20 October 1877

AN ISLE OF WIGHT SNUGGLING CASE.

At the sitting of the Isle of Wight magistrates at Newport, on Saturday, David Cotton, fisherman, of Brixton, was charged with being on board a vessel named the Cloud, within a port of the United Kingdom, with a device adapted for the purpones of smuggling, on the 5th inst.—Mr. Henderson, Collector of Customs at West Cowes, prosecuted; Mr. Douglas Ford, of Portsmouth, defended.—Mr. Henderson, in his opening address, explained the nature of the offence, and pointed out that the punishment was forfeiture of the vessel and the infliction of a penalty not exceeding £100 upon every person found on board. On the vessel in question was found a warp 13 fathoms in length, with about 73 slings attached. On searching the wreck a large sinker was also found attached, and these he would prove by experienced officers were devices adapted for the purposes of smuggling. —The following evidence was then called: —George French deposed: I am chief boatman in charge of the Reath detachment, St. Catherine's Point station. I remember that early on the morning of Friday, the 5th inst, my attention was called to the movements of a small vessel proceeding eastward. I had the crew called out and approached her; Joseph Path was with me. I found her with her head to the north west on the rocks at Puckaster Point. I went on board, and on searching the vessel found a stray warp with tub slings attached. These slings are never used for any other purpose than running tubs. It was lying one part on the hatch and the other part in the hold. One of the hatches was off. It is a bran new warp, including the slings. It was wet when found, and had been lately in the water. I consider this warp is a device adapted for smuggling. I do not consider it could be used for any purpose connected with fishing or any other legitimate purpose. I have searched the wreck since then and found the sinker produced (a large piece of granite with rope similar to the slings attached.) It is used for sinking a warp with tubs attached to it. I have seen several warpd of the kind used for sinking goods and running tubs. I have seen seizures made whilst in one of the cruisers for the detection of smugglers. In making these seizures I have seen warps exactly like the one produced; fitted in the same way. I recognise the prisoner, whom I found lying across the hatches, with his feet hanging over the vessel's side, drunk. He could give no account of himself. The vessel was in a bad condition; fast filling with water. I made him a prisoner on suspicion of smuggling. After I had made him a prisoner he said, "I do not care a ———; we have got the tubs all right." I took him to the watch-house. At this time. I did not know his name. He told me John Chambers, of Freshwater. was with him, but it has since turned out that he was of Yarmouth. I found out the name of the vessel was the Cloud, of Cowes, which was painted on the piece of wreck produced.— By Mr. Ford: I have been in the coastguard eighteen years. I was never a fisherman. I am not accustomed to trawling. I can swear the piece of rope produced could not be used for trawling, because I have seen trawling gear and stood alongside while it has been fitted up. I have never actually trawled. I found a trawl net on board the vessel on the deck. I have heard of a stopper; it is used for stopping a trawl rope, stipping a cable, or running a rope. One stopper might be used for trawling; not 70. It could not be used for the purpose of trawling, as it is not fit for a ground rope, line net, or a trawl rope, because of the large number of stops. I have never seen stopper ropes of that thickness. There is no reason why a rope of this description could not be used for a stopper, because you can use any rope on board a ship for a stopper. There is no doubt it was used for the purpose of stopping the tubs. The rope produced was much too large for a stopper on board a little thing like the Cloud. A three-inch could be used for the purpose of a stopper. A three-quarter inch was too large for so small a vessel. Joseph Petty was with me when prisoner made the statement. It was made in the watch-room in reply to a question. I asked the prisoner where he came from, and where he was going. That was about two hours after I took him from the vessel. He was sober enough to make a statement. Two hours before he was so druuk that he could give no account of himself. The vessel went to pieces. I believe the owner of the vessel possessed a fisherman's license. There was not a strong wind blowing that night. There was a little ripple on the sea which might have come over a vessel of that size.—By the Chairman: It was a small vessel of about ten tons.—Joseph Petty, boatman in the Coastguard Service at St. Catherines Point Station, residing at Reath detachment, gave similar evidence to the previous witness, adding: The statement respecting the landing of the tubs was made on board the boat. Prisoner was sober when in the watch-house, and knew what he was doing. Prisoner said he had landed them in the bay, but he did not name any bay. Prisoner said he had come from Alum Bay, but nothing more was said to his knowledge.—By Mr. Ford: This was a clear night, and the ship was on the rocks. There was a little bit of a "chop" on. The vessel was about six or eight tons, but the sea would not go over when he saw it. There was not a stiff breeze when he boarded the vessel, about half past three o'clock that morning. There was a light breeze at one o'clock, but there was not sufficient sea to wash over the vessel. He was positive that the statement previously mentioned was made on the boat about ten minutes after they had left the vessel. French heard the conversation in the boat and in the watch-house too. I am not accustomed to trawling. The rope produced could not be used for trawling because the slings would be in the way, and it would be too awkward. They were not strong enough for stoppers. A stopper is not used for the purpose of easing the main rope. I cannot give any reason why the rope could not be used for trawlieg purposes.— By the Chairman: There were no fish found in the boat.—Cross-examined by Mr. Ford: I stayed on board half an hour until told by my superior officer to leave. There was no water where the net was. There were three feet of water in the hold.—Thomas Hunter, chief officer in the coastguard service at East Cowes, deposed: I have been in the coastguard service close upon seven and twenty years. Of that period I have been from 11 to 12 years in the Isle of Wight. I have had considerable experience with smuggling in the Island. The drag warp produced is exactly similar to what I have seen used for smuggling purposes. I will not swear it has been used for nothing else. —By the Chairmen: I have not found the same kind of rope on board other vessels besides those engaged in smuggling. -By Mr. Ford: I have seen trawlmg repeatedly. The rope produced could not be used for such purposes, because such stops are not required for trawling. There may be stops used for trawling purposes, but not such stops as those.—John Hayman, chief-boatman in charge of Shanklin station, deposed: I have seen similar pieces of rope to that produced and used for the purpose of smuggling. I have never seen it used for other purposes.—By Mr. Ford: I do not say it cannot be used for any other purpose.—Mr. Douglas Ford, in addressing the Bench for their defence, stated that of all prosecutions the most difficult to meet were those of the Customs, which were supported by a comprehensive Act of Parliament containing nearly 300 sections. They (the Bench) had, in addition to their duties as justices of the peace, to fulfil also to some extent the functions of a jury, and to come to an absolute conclusion upon the matter. First of all, did the statements of the witnesses correspond? He thought not. The first witness told them the prisoner was drunk when he went on board and when put into the boat. Afterwards prisoner was conveyed to the watch-house, and the witness told them not one word about a conversation taking place in the boat. Although the witnesses for the proseeution said the rope was used for the purposes of smuggling, yet of them would swear positively that it could not be used for any other purpose.—The Chairman: Then you see the Act is stringent; it does not say it shall be used for any purpose, but "any device adapted" for that one pursuit. I cannot see how much further you can go, the words are so stringent.— Mr. Ford agreed that the words were stringent, but still it did not do away with the fact that this piece of rope was on board for the purpose of assisting the prisoner in his business as a fisherman. He pointed out that because rope was said to be adapted for the purposes of smuggling they were not necessarily bound to come to the conclusion that the prisoner was guilty. Doubtless the rope might be used for smuggling, but he also contended that it was frequently used for purposes of trawling, to prevent too great a strain upon the net. He reviewed the evidence and urged that the facts were consistent with the theory advanced that the rope was used for the purpose of trawling, the owner of the vessel possessing a fisherman's license, a trawl net being found on board, and the uncontrevertible statement that the rope and its appendages might have been used for other purposes. They were there on very unequal terms, being hedged in and around by the stringent wording of this Act of Parliament. He commented upon the serious penalty should they convict his client, and urged that there was a strong doubt in the case, of which the prisoner should have the benefit. Mr. Ford submitted that according to the section they must have some proof of the knowledge or intention that it was used for the purpose. Even supposing it had been a yacht or any other vessel, would it necessarily be held that because it had these things on board it could be brought under the purview of that Act of Parliament and the owner be subjected to a penalty of £100? He then called the following witness: — George Barber, residing at Portsmouth, deposed: I have had 35 years' experience as a fisherman. The rope produced is used for trawling purposes on "tasty" or rocky ground. There are stoppers upon it and double-stoppers. The kick rope was the main or standing rope, with single and double stoppers. The bigger the vessel the bigger the stopper required. The number of stoppers depended on the ground where they were going to trawl. I have seen hundreds of such ropes used for trawling purposes.— The Chairman: Have you ever seen a trawling rope with stoppers placed so close together? — Witness: I have seen 50 stoppers on a rope.—By Mr. Ford: I do not know how many stoppers there are on the rope produced.—Mr. Henderson: In a fishing smack of six tons, what would be the length of a trawling rope? — Witness: It is according to the depth of water it is in sir.— Q. Supposing twenty fathoms of water? A. 60 fathems of rope.—Q. In a rope of 34 fathoms, how may stoppers would be used? A. It would very likely have 40 or 50 stoppers if on very rough ground. If the ground was clear it would not require any at all. I have never seen a stray warp.— The Chairman (Mr. T. Leach): We are decidedly and unanimously of opinion that there must be a conviction in the case. We think the Commissioners will he satisfied by our inflicting a penalty of £10 and £4 b15*s.* 5*d.* costs. Prisoner will be detained until the money is paid.— —John Chambers, fisherman, was charged with the same offence.—David Cotton, prisoner in the precedieg case, was the first witness called, and, having been cautioned, the clerk (Mr. Fardell) was examined by Mr. Henderson: I am a fisherman, residing at Brixton. The defendant is John Chambers, living at Yarmouth, who goes a fishing in the Cloud. She belongs to Yarmouth. The "Cloud: was painted on her stern. On being shown the piece of the wreck with the name, he said he could not read, so was not aware there was anything else upon it. On the morning of the 5th, were you aboard the cloud?—Mr. Ford: I submit, with all possible respect, that the witness may be told he is not obliged to answer that question.—Q. Where were you on the morning of the 5th inst.— Mr. Ford: I advise you not to answer that queation. I take upon myself the responsibility. -Q. Do you remember seeing the defendant yesterday morning week? -Mr. Ford: I advise you not to answer. -The Chairman: If you continue stopping him like this, you might just as well close his mouth altogether. —Mr. Ford: That is just what I want to do, sir.-Q. Where were you yesterday morning week? A. On board a vessel.-Q. What vessel?-Mr. Ford: I tell you not to answer that question.-Witness, with some hesitation: The Cloud. I last saw Chambers on board that vessel when she struck. There was a boat at the stern of the vessel. I suppose the boat's name was marked upon it. I saw Chambers leave, but did not see on what direction.—Mr. Ford contended that as the Customs had obtained all they required from the witness, it was not becoming to press him farther.- James Aldridge, boatman in the coastguard at Shanklin, identified prisoner as the man he apprehended at Shanklin on the morning of the 6th inst.— In reply to witness, prisoner said he was the man who landed at Luccombe in a boat the morning before, but he at first denied it. The name of John Chambers, of Yarmouth, was upon the boat which was found at Luccombe Cove.— Silas Kemp, fisherman, residing at Luccombe, deposed that on the morning of the 5th inst., he was out fishieg about eight o'clock, and landed at Luccombe, heteeen eight and nine. There was a boat close to where they hauled theirs in. The boat had "Yarmouth" painted on the bottom. There were so many boats in there during the day that he did not know one from the other. When he got home he there saw a man having some breakfast. Prisoner was the man.— Captain Roach was the next witness called, but he did not answer.— The Chairman, at this point, stated that they decided to dismiss this case.

The Undercliff Of The Isle Of Wight Past And Present
by Whitehead, John L.

SMUGGLERS AND SMUGGLING.

"We'll go down among the Needle Kocks.  
And put them all ashore, O!  
Back again to Cherbourg,  
And take in some more, O! *—Old Song.*

Till within a comparatively recent period "the back of the Wight," and more particularly that part of it known to-day as the Undercliff, was a sort of *terra incognita* to the rest of the Islanders and to the people over on the mainland, "overners," as they were called. This isolation accounts in some measure for the lawless spirit, which would seem — judging from the reports which appear in contemporary annals — to have been present here from the earliest times, and to have infected the whole seafaring population along the sea front between Bembridge and Freshwater.

A large traffic in contraband goods was carried on between the Isle of Wight and the opposite coast of France. This illicit trade attained its maximum height during the disturbed state which prevailed on the continent, between 1780 and 1840, when it is said that four of every six seafaring men took an active part in connection therewith.

TO DO

Occasional ventures of even a more reprehensjjble kind occurred from time to time. An instance of this nature is detailed in the Patent Rolls : —

1317. "Commission of oyer and terminer to John de Foxle, John dc

July 22. Stonore and Richard de Borhunt on complaint by Nicholas de

Nottingham. Castre, merchant of Spain, that Geoffrey de Yonge, of Brerding .... with others, boarded a ship of his off the^coast between Portesmuth, co. Southampton, and the Isle of Wight, assaulted his men and carried away his goods, etc."i

The questions affecting the legality of the proceedings were possibly'* never entertained, or, perhaps, tacitly ignored. The love of adventure and excitement attendant upon it were the primary motives with many of those who took part, and any schemes which tended to dispel the monotony of village life were heartily welcomed by the younger members

‘ 1 Cal. Pat, R., 1317—1321.


of the community. With others, the inducement to add something to the precarious livelihood obtained by them as fishermen was too strong to be suppressed. It affected all classes, so that to be taken red-handed did not prejudice the offenders socially with their neighbours, and consequently the traffic in contraband goods extended its ramifications throughout the coast villages, from Bembridge to Freshwater. In Bi|hop Wykeham's register reference is made to "a writ of summons being issued, in 1394, against the rector of Freshwater, on a charge of smuggling wool to France."

In the earlier years only a few excisemen — preventive men as they were at first called — were stationed along the sea-front. They were also inadequately paid, with the result that they were lukewarnj in thetr efforts to prevent, even if they did not covertly acquiesce and share in the profits accruing from the smuggling ventures themselves.

Two remarkable incidents in the Isle of Wight in connection with the contraband trade are related, and, on account of them, material alterations took place in the general "Laws of the King." Before the year 1733 it was the practice of the Courts at Winchester, when issue was found between Plaintiff and Defendant, that a writ of Venire Facias Juratores " should be awarded by which the sheriff was commissioned to summon twelve men {liberos et legates Homines) to try the cause. But by the Statute of George III, commonly called the "Balloting Act," it is enacted : —

"That the Sheriff of the County to which the return of the Venire shall belong, shall annex a panel of the said writ, containing the names, additions, and places of abode of a competent number of Jurors, qualified to serve on Juries, not less than 48, or more than 72, for the Trial of Issues, at the Assizes in each County."

And by section II of the same statute it is enacted : —

"That the names of each and every Person, so impanelled shall be written, on distinct pieces of parchment or paper, and delivered to the Marshalls to be put into a Box or Glass, and when any cause is brought to trial, some indifferent person shall, in open Court, draw twelve of the said Parchments, or Papers only; and the Persons whose names shall be so drawn shall be the Jury to try the Cause." ^

This very material alteration in trials by jury was occasioned by the following circumstance:— Hatch and Boyce, two noted smugglers, had for several years, before the above-mentioned Act was passed, carried on the smuggling trade (particularly in French and other foreign wines) to a degree that was never known before, between the Isle of Wight and the Hampshire coast. Boyce, originally a blacksmith by trade, built and lived at Apley House, near Ryde, and Hatch resided at Berry on the opposite coast, about half a mile from Stokes Bay. They had large and roomy cellars under the houses, in which they lodged the cargoes. The trade they carried on could not escape the notice of the Government, and proceedings were frequently instituted against them by the Crown, but notwithstanding that the most positive proofs were adduced, the Government could never secure a conviction. They not only had witnesses at hand, prepared to swear whateve^ they were bid,

but the jurymen, who were to try the case, being well known, were tampered with, and even the Under-Sheriffs were suspected of being influenced by corrupt means, to summon men who were in the pay of the defendants to try the cause, etc. Lord Northington sifted the matter, and secured the passing of the Act which put a stop to the iniquitous proceedings. Both defendants were ultimately convicted and made prisoners in the Fleet.

At the time of his conviction Boyce was said to have had forty thousand pounds invested as the proceeds resulting from this contraband trade. ^

Though the illegal traffic was maintained with the opposite coast of France, the Dutch were also especially active in sharing in the trade.

The ^modus pperandi has often been described. Each village had a chosen leader, who took a foremost part in the preliminary negotiations, and was trusted and valued for the skill, energy, judgment, and presence of mind he had evinced in the past. The names of many of the earlier leaders, though at the time household words, have now become traditionary, and those belonging to a later generation will soon also become legendary.

The business was conducted on co-operative principles, each shareholder subscribing a sum of money varying in amount, for investment in spirits, tea, tobacco, etc., and towards the outgoing expenses, incidental to the run and subsequent landing of the cargo. Two classes of boats were used, the one most in request being a lightly built rowing boat, for four or six oars, painted white, having a broad beam affording ample stowage room for the return cargo. These galleys would stow away 40 to 50 four gallon tubs of spirits, and in fine weather, manned by a crew of four to six stalwart men, with one or two others commissioned to purchase the cargo, could be rowed across the channel in a few hours. The second class were small sailing vessels, ranging in size from forty tons, with a stowage capacity of from one hundred to two hundred and fifty tubs, down to smaller deck vessels of ten tons. These generally hailed from Bembridge, St. Helen's, or Ryde.

The money having been handed in, the boats w»3uld depart during the night. The greatest caution was necessary to avoid being overhauled or run down by the numerous craft always on the look out to intercept them, either going or retuFfting. The price paid for the raw spirit at Cherbourg was an established one, fourteen shillings being paid for each keg of spirits; the charge for freightage across was three shillings, and the other incidental expenses of landing, jhore hands, etc., came to an equal amount. The four gallon cask of proof spirit would thus cost a pound. After being diluted with an equal quantity of water, and colouring matters — consisting of burnt sugar — shaving been added, the sale price of the cask would be fifty shillings, and retailed to the public at half a crown a bottle, would command a ready sale, realising a hundred per cent, profit.

The return journey, "running the cargo" as it was called, was more risky and dangerous than the departure from the island, seeing

that the vessel's absence would be reported to the coastguard on shore. Hence every precaution would have to be taken to dispose of the freight in case of surprise or emergency. For this purpose a stout warp was passed round the outside of the vessel, to which the tubs were fastened by their slings. Each line had small pieces of cork attached to serve as buoys, and stone sinkers were added, so that by cutting the spun yarii by which the warp was slung to the vessel's side the whole would be hidden away out of sight. The point on the coast where the landing would be made had been previously decided upon. Here a good lookout woultt be kept, while shore hands would hold themselves in readiness to carry off the cargo. It was known that the coastguard were accustomed to meet at certain points on their beat, and then to pass onwards. These centres would be watched, and when the men had passed each other the critical moment was at hand. The other conditions being favourable, a prearranged signal was given, generally by the flashing of a light from a suitable point on the shore well hidden from the view of the coastguard. The vessel, or boat, would then run in as close to the shore as possible, and the tubs, previously fastened to a rope, were cut adrift, the end of the warp having the tubs attached being brought ashore in a small boat. A gang of men would be in readiness to lay hold of the warp the instant the boat touched the ground, speedily hauling in the rope and unfastening the tubs as they came to hand. Each keg was fastened to the rope by slings, composed of strong cord, a foot and a half in length; two of these cords were tied together, and the tubs slung over the shoulders of the shore hands were promptly carried away to be hidden, or taken up over the cliffs to some inland rendezvous. When a favoured landing place was not available other possibly more dangerous places were resorted to. Luccombe, with its perpendicular cliffs, was often negotiated. H assail states that in his day "the principal use of the Chine was for smuggled goods, many hundred casks of which were sometimes secreted in the cavities and there securely concealed."

There were many other suitable places in different parts of the Undercliff. offering facilities for stowing away the cargoes. The cottages at Luccombe belonged to the squatters, and were occupied by farm labourers and fishermen. Underground cellars sufficiently large to hide away a consignment of "tubs" had been made by excavating and removing the soft sandstone under the front room floor. Three brothers named Kingswell lived here, and were well known as keen smugglers, being constantly engaged in the traffic carried on from this point of the coast. Charlie Kingswell, the best known of the brothers, was a hardy, picturesque old salt, who died recently at a very advanced age. On one occasion his cottage was unexpectedly visited by the excise officers, to whom probably some information had been given, but only on arrival to find Kingswell's wife apparently suffering from spasms and groaning loudly as she rolled in her chair from side to side. In order to relieve the pain "Old Hannah" had been forced to drink sorpe raw brandy, and this seemed to account for the suspicious odour which pervaded

the dwelling. So at least the officer seemed to conclude, for after searching the cottage he reluctantly retired, without having noticed the trap door, under Hannah's chair, leading to the underground cellar. These cottages have since disappeared in the coast land-slips which have been so prevalent during the past few years.

At Bonchurch also the local fishermen supplemented their scanty earnings with occasional smuggling ventures. A large natural cavp in the cliffs, known as "Old Jack," served as one of the receptacles, in which five hundred gallons of smuggled spirits and other illicit goods are known to have been stowed away at one time. ®

The origin of the numerous ghost and other like stories, so rife in the village, may be traced to the nefarious operations carried on by the gang of* smugglers, for the mysterious noises, etc., often heard during the night were intentionally added to with the object of frightening away the more curious sight-seers. At certain seasons the lower road was thought to be haunted by a "Phantom" as it was called, on horseback. This apparition created a great scare, and for the time was a terror to the neighbourhood.

It was a clever device of the smugglers, who made use of the horse for a two-fold purpose, to carry away the tubs of spirits up the little coombe at the rear of St. Boniface House, and to Mghten away the timid villagers. To deaden the noise, and at the same time to frighten the uninitiated, the hoofs of the horse were padded, and the application of a little phosphorus to man and beast produced a very startling effect, serving the purpose the men had in view most effectually. An outsider's view of the matter is given in the following narrative : — A man was hurriedly sent on horseback in the middle of the night, by the ladies living at East Dene, to bring the doctor, Mr. Bloxam, out from Newport. The case was an urgent one, and Page, a reliable man, set off, his mind fully preoccupied with the anxieties of the journey, and was hurrying along, when, to his dismay and horror, the ghostly apparition of the man on the white horse appeared, blocking the way through the valley. The natural impulse of the man was to turn round and beat a retreat, but recalling the urgent necessity of his e^and, he made an effort and pulled himself together, feeling he must get through somehow. Making a savage cut at the strange horse with his heavy whip, he was as much astonished as relieved to find the beast divide in half, disappear in the air, and thus vanish from sight 1 Another story current during the early forties related to the "Ghost Coach." The coach could be distinctly heard travelling slowly along through the village by the lower road, halting for a moment at one of the cottages opposite the pond, then passing onwards, the sounds gradually grew fainter and fainter, and at last ceased altogether. No vehicle of any kind is ever reported to have been seen. It is supposed that the spacious cellars existing under the basement of the old manor house were utilised to stow away contraband goods, a purpose for which the cellars were eminently suited, and more especially so if, as tradition asserts, an underground phssage existed, having an entrance from the shore below.

In The Story of my Life, by Augustus J. C. Hare, there is an interesting local allusion, and as it relates to St. Boniface House it is here given m extenso,

"February 4, 1866. — I spent yesterday evening with the Henry Feildens. Mrs. Feilden told me that in her girlhood her family went to the Isle of Wight and rented St. Boniface House, between Bonchurch and Ventnor. She slept in a room on the first floor with her sister Ghita : the French governess and her^sister Cha slept in the next room, the English governess above. If they talked in bed they were always punished by the English governess, who could not bear them; so they never spoke except in a whisper. One night, when they were^n bed, with the curtains closely drawn, the door was suddenly burst open with a bang, and something rushed into the room and began to whisk about in it, making a great draught and disturbance. They were not frightened, but very angry, thinking someone was playing them a trick. But immediately the curtains were drawn aside and whisked up over their heads, and one by one all the bed'Clothes were dragged away from them, though when they stretched out their hands they could feel nothing. First the counterpane went, then the blankets, then the sheet, then the pillows, and lastly the lower sheet was drawn away from under them. When it came to this she (Ellinor Hornby) exclaimed, * I can bear this no longer,* and she and her sister both jumped out of bed at the foot, which was the side nearest the door. As they jumped out, they felt the mattress graze against their legs, as it also was dragged oflf the bed. Ghita Hornby rushed into the next room to call the French governess, while Ellinor screamed for assistance, holding the door of their room tightly on the outside, fully believing that somebody would be found in the room. The English governess and the servants, roused by the noise, now rushed downstairs, and the door was opened. The room was perfectly still, and there was no one there. It was all tidied. The curtains were carefully rolled, and tied up above the head of the bed : the sheet and counterpane were neatly folded up in squares and laid in three corners of the room : the mattress was reared against the wall under the window : the blanket was in the fireplace. Both the governesses protested that the girls must have done it themselves in their sleep, but nothing would induce them to return to the room, and they were surprised the next morning, when they expected a scolding from their mother, to find that she quietly assented to the room being shut up. Many years after Mrs. Hornby met the lady to whom the property belonged, and after questioning her about what happened to her family, the lady told her that the same thing had often happened to others.'*

The property which belonged to Mrs. James White was sold fifty 3^ears ago, and theje does not appear to have been any repetition of these unaccountable occurrences since. These, and many other stories of a like nature, then current, are becoming more and more legendary as time slips along.

The fishermen also at St. Lawrence took an active part in the contraband traffic, having a brace of leaders in "Captains" Harvey and Hingston. The former resided at "The Duck," a little wayside publichouse (see pp. 177-8). This inn was the resort of all the "ne'er do wells" in the district, and did a brisk trade in all kinds of smuggled goods. Harvey was a big powerful fellow, standing over six feet in height, and figured as the central object in many of the stories narrated of adventures which happened at this period. One of the last seizures of contraband goods was made at St. Lawrence. The steward belonging to a nobleman's yacht, making the most of his ogportunities, invested in a large assortment of fancy goods, silks, tobacco, and spirits,

and these he concealed in the hold of the yacht. The stores were being stealthily removed and stored in underground cellars near the house, when suspicions were aroused, and the father of Kerrenhappuc Newnham, of happy memory, was taken into custody by the excisemen in the act of transferring the goods from the vessel to the shore, and a year's imprisonment followed upon his conviction.

Binnel Bay, near Old Park, in the adjoining parish, was a well-known rendezvous of the local freebooters. A secret underground passage existed at this point of the coast, running up from the shore and opening above amongst the bushy growth in the tangled wilderness at the foot of the upper cliffs. The proceeds of "a run" could thus be removed from view in a very short space of time.

Whit Well and Niton were two noted centres, sharing in the notoriety that the exploits of an individual widely known as the "Great Smuggler" conferred on the locality. Ralph Stone was the local hero of the time, and his fame was due to the numberless exciting adventures in which he was the central figure. The tact, energy, and judgment Stone displayed on all occasions enabled him to carry through his plans with few mishaps, and thus made him a commanding figure in the local history. Dressed as a gentleman farmer of those days, in a loose velveteen shooting coat and waistcoat, a white hat, fancy trousers, and Wellington boots, his quiet manner and easy conversation disarmed suspicion, and in no way .suggested the desperate risks he was constantly running.

Despite his wonderful seamanship, his vessel was seized several times, and Stone had to pass several periods of imprisonment as "a debtor to the Crown" in Winchester Gaol. Dying in the fullness of years, he left his heirs a considerable property which had accrued from the illicit trade he had carried on. His father, and many of his relations before him, had all been similarly engaged in open defiance of the local preventive service.

The smaller fry captured on these occasions were usually sent to gaol for a year's incarceration. Five years' service on board a man-ofwar was the sentence imposed upon offenders belonging to the class of able-bodied seamen.

After the immediate excitement of«the run was over, and matters had quieted down, the goods had still to be delivered to the several parties owning them. This always proved a very risky proceeding, and the local annals teem with the mishaps that befell the men fef that day. Mr. Long describes one phase, illustrative of this stage, in the dialect of the locality, as follows * Aye, they ded use to do a lot o' smuggl^ ^ about here fifty or sixty years agoo, when I was a bwoy. I've heerd my father zay, one time dree or vower on 'em, wi' tubs and bags of tay, got ver' near took to by the Custom House officers, but they managed to git off the shore and into the churchyard at Niton; but zome o' the officers had slipped round another road, and prid near penned 'em in all zides! They thought 'twas a gooser wi' 'em, but one on 'em.

a terbul voreright feller, called Mussel, zays : * Come on, mayets, I be darned if I won't be upzides wi* they fellers, zoo they prised up the stooan on one o' they gurt high brick tombs there es there, and got inside, tubs and all, and bid quiet. Cooase the officers lost 'em, and couldn't think where the deuce they was gone to, and aater searchen about a bit, they went away. Zoon aaterwards, jest as 'twas gitten daylight, my father was gwyne droo the churchyard to goo to work, wh8n all at once he zees the stooan top o' one o' the tombs begin to move. He stopped short, and stared wi' all the eyes he'd got, when up goos the^tooan higher, and a man's faace peeps out at one corner and zays : ‘ I zay, mayet, can ye tell me what time 'tes? ' I've heerd my father zay hes hear lifted hes hat clane off hes head; a couldn't move, but stood there staren like a stuck pig; but when Mussell axed 'en what time 'twas, he roared out, and run back prid near frightened to death. He run into the vust house a come to, and zays to the people: 'Whatever will become on us I The dead vokes in the churchyard be gitten out o' their graaves!' He was regular terrified, and it gid 'en sich a turn he couldn't goo to work that day. Zometime aaterwards he vound out the rights o't, and he and Mussel and t 'others had many a laugh about it." `[W. H. Long, Dialect of the I. of W., p. 87.]`

TO DO ABOVE

A discussion with the elders of the several villages abutting on the coast will elicit numbers of like stories, relating more especially to the Niton and Chale churches. The precincts of the sacred edifices were not held inviolate; "any port in a storm" was the adage, and certain tombs are still pointed out as having been frequently used as a depository for stores of illicit goods.

A lucrative trade in bygone days was also carried on with homeward bound ships going up the Channel, by purchasing from the skipper and his crew tea — then selling from seven to nine shillings a pound — tobacco, gloves, silk, etc., duty free, and retailing them afterwards, at much higher prices, to the housewives, living further inland.

The inevitable result of this illicit trade in cheap raw material followed. Habitual drunkenness and the consequent misery was very rife amongst the upsident population of the Undercliff. To be sober and temperate was the marked exception to the rule. The facilities for imbibing were many; unlicensed houses, known as shebeen or pop shops, were numerous, selling home brewed ale, at fourpence a quart, or glasses of grog at threepence. Other spirits could be obtained at an equally cheap rate.

In the Niton village records allusions are made to the "White Lion," the "Cat and Rabbit," the "Buddle," the "Star," and the "Blue Lion." These formed quite a respectable list of inns for so small a place, all of them prepared to minister to the bibulous propensities of their idle, dissolute customers, and mighty topers some of them were. The spirit of the age may be traced in a story, connected with the Boni^hurch villagers. Some sixty years ago the pond overflowed its banks, and as the water showed no signs of subsiding a council of wise men was called to consider how the difficulty could be most readily surmounted. The conference, however, did not see any feasible way of solving the problem. In the dilemma the chairman appealed to one of the bystanders — a rough and ready customer, named Dyer — saying, "Well, Bill, can you help us to get rid of this water?" He at once replied "Oh, yes, we chaps ull get rid of it for ye; throw in a couple o' hogsheads o' brandy, and us 'ull drink up the lot for 'e."

At length, with an improved and more efficient coastguard service, the smuggling business became too hazardous, whilst at the stme time the reduction in the excise duties levied made even successful ventures so much less remunerative that the contraband trade largely diminished. A raid at Niton in the late fifties was of so inquisitorial a character, and proved so disastrous to the fair fame of many of the inhabitants, that it gave the *coup de grâce* to further smuggling ventures on a large scale. It was evident, from the places searched, that a local informer had given sundry precise hints. A tub or two, found here and there, kept over for private consumption from the last run, involved so many in the fines and penalties that were inflicted, and produced so great an effect, that the illicit business died out, and the various stories alone linger to remind us of the past history of this nefarious traffic.

A SMUGGLER'S DIARY

Is "Longman's Magazine" for January, Mr W. H. Hunt gives us some curious leaves from the diary of a fisherman, farm-hand, and smuggler, who lived in the Isle of Wight in the latter half of the eighteenth century.

Wheeler, says Mr Hunt, was a man of parts and of some little local importance. He owned a boat, fatted a pig or two yearly, and did an extensive trade in smuggled gin. School Boards were yet undreamed of and popular education barely existed in name; nevertheless, Robert contrived to acquire a little learning, and in a crabbed, crooked fist he kept a rough day-book, or diary, wherein he noted down from time to time some of the more important business transactions of his life. To the end he was unable to spell his own name correctly, and always wrote it as he pronounced it—Whiller. But there is no doubt it should have been Wheeler, for the Wheelers of Chale Bay are a numerous family even unto this day, when a local cricket eleven has been known to contain half a dozen of them. Robert Wheeler's diary is still extant.

They were stirring times in which Wheeler lived. The first year of his written record saw Boston Harbour black with British tea and the colonies of North America breaking into open revolt. Before the book closed, France had passed from a seething mass of unrest to some sort of settled government under the First Empire, and the Little Corsican had sent more than one thrill through the Isle of Wight and along the whole south coast of England by threats of invasion. Of all this Robert Wheeler says never a word. His is a purely domestic diary, dealing with the purchasing price of the gallon loaf, the selling price of a gallon of gin, the conveyance of prawns to the London market; the rates of wages paid for various kinds of farm service, and the cost of brewings of home-made ale.

Here and there, he speaks of a smuggling adventure, and once he refers to the purchase of a weekly paper as a noteworthy event, but not a word does he say, from first to last, of momentous affairs transpiring in the great world outside, nor is there the slightest indication of any perturbation on the part of himself or his fellow islanders at the chances of war or threats of invasion. Even the naval mutiny at Portsmouth, of which he must have heard a good deal, is passed over in silence, although he tells of large catches of mackerel disposed of in that town. It is true he lived in a "lotos land"— the Garden Isle of England,  where to-morrow is still as good as to-day— but we cannot suppose that he was entirely indifferent to all these external things. We can only assume that this diary, being pre-eminently a private affair, was limited strictly to private concerns.

But to the diary itself. In the year 1774 (continues Mr. Hunt), there is a charactoristic entry with some equally characteristic arithmetic.

March 5.—

I reseid of my wife won pound twelf and sixpence ........ ........ £1 12 6

She reseid of Mr Shofer thirteen shillings ........ 0 13 0

........ ........ ........ ........ 0 19 0

March 9.—
Had 18 shillings more of her....... 0 18 0

........ ........ ........ ........  1 16 0

Due to she ........ ........ ........ ........ 0 16 0

The true inwardness of this transaction is past finding out. It seems to imply that long before a Married Woman's Property Act was thought of Mrs Robert Wheeler of Chale had a separate estate, that she advanced to her husband £1. 12*s.* 6*d.*, at the same time receiving on his account from Mr Shoter the sum of 13*s.*, which should have left due to her from her husband 19*s.* 6*d.* Disdaining odd ha'pence, he sets down the balance as 19s. He then borrows an additional 18*s.*, and enters the total debit as £1, 16*s.* How the final amount comes to be 16*s.* it is impossible to decide, unless it may be regarded as a mistake for the £1. 16*s.* repeated from above.

On April 3, in the same year, we get a glimpse of an eighteenth century fisherman's transactions with a firm of London fish salesmen; to which is added a note suggesting some uneasiness of mind on the part of the fisherman as to their bona fides.

"April 3, sent eight hundred and a quarter prawns to London to Mr Antony Brown & Son, salesman, tem street, ner Billinsgate, London. Not payd for."

Subsequently his mind was eased as to the honesty of Brown & Son, "Billinsgate," but he was somewhat doubtful as to the profitableness of the transaction. He writes:—

"I reseved nine shillings, which is all:..........d.  
"I payd for a basket to pack them......... 4  
"I payd carriage to Southampton ............ 6  
"I payd for salt for boilen them ............... 3  
"I payd for a letter come from London........ 9"

So that he had as the nett result of this transaction the modest sum of 7*s.* 2*d.*, which is little enough when one remembers that prawns are now sold at Ventnor in season at from 4s. to 6s. a hundred, with no carriage to be deducted, or to London dealers, when scarce, at £1 per hundred. Unfortunately for Wheeler, there was no Ventnor in those days. Its site was occupied by a house and mill, and London, whether by lumbering waggons or the more expeditious stage-coach, was far to seek. It is worth noting that the cost of a letter from London was considerably more than the carriage of a fair-sized package of prawns from Chale to Southampton, by the shortest route a distance of thirty miles.

In the same month he records that

"James Whiller had of Willum Jollif a new pare of shoes, 6*s.* 8*d.*"—an indication that if prawns sold ill and postage was excessive, shoes were, at any rate, proportionately cheap.

On December 16 he had a "pare of fore pieces, 1s."—toe-caps for his shoes. Then follows a long list of crabs and lobsters sold; crabs at 1 1/4d. a pound and lobsters at 3d. To-day crabs so sold fetch 6d. a pound and lobsters 1s.

Once the smuggler was severely bit. Under the year 1776 we read—

"March 29.—Gorge Brite, Barney Hale, and myself was robbed of our money on board a Dutch galiot hoy to the valey of seven pounds and fourteen shillings."

Detestable Dutchmen, to have taken such advantage of these confiding islanders! Picture "Gorge Brite, Barney Hale, and myself" setting out with due caution and money in hand to bargain with the crew of the Dutch galiot hoy, lying in the offing, for Dutch schnapps and other contraband articles, and the woebegone manner of their return without money and without goods.

Mr. Hunt writes—

In 1803 war was again declared against France, several thousand British tourists on French soil were thrown into prison, a hundred thousand troops lay at Boulogne waiting to invade England, and Robert Emmett— grandfather of Mrs Louis Botha—headed a new rebellion in Ireland. Wheeler's principal entry this year is "Willam Whiller killed my pig waid 13 score 15." He mentions that it was a bad year for crabs. He began fishing in March and ended in May, and he and his partner only earned £6, 8s. between them.

On January 14, 1804, he "bouth a quarter of a sack of flour for 11*s.* 3*d.*" On January 17 for a sack of barley at Westside he paid 12*s.* 6*d.* On March 6 a quarter of a sack of fine flour cost him 9*s.* 9*d.* On February 15, 18, and 19 he "made a load of fus (furze) faggots at Kingston at Farmer Dyer's." By April 6 the price of flour had risen, a quarter of a sack costing 10*s.* 3*d.*

This year he was busily engaged in smuggling, and his book has the following, among other entries:—

"March 25. Tub of brandy ............. £1 17 0  
" "     Tub of gin ........ ......... 1 18 0  
"April     Left to pay at Gatten... 1 19 4  
" "     Tub of gin .................. 1 17 0  
"May    9. Reserved by cash at Gatten ...... 1 18 0  
"May   13. Ditto         ditto  1 17 0  
"May   18. For tub of gin ............ 1 19 0  
"June   12. Resed by cash ............ 2 0 0  
"June   13. Resed by cash ............ 2 0 0  
"June   28. Tub of gin ................. 1 18 0  
"August    Reseved by cash at Gatten .................... 2 0 0  
"August    Tub of gin .................. 1 17 0  
"         Tobacco ................... 0 2 0  
"         Had at Gatten tub of Brandy ................... 1 13 0  
"Aug.   14. Tub of gin ................. 1 17 0  
"Sept.     Gin in harvest ............ 1 19 0  
"Oct.    13. Tub of gin ................ 1 18 0  
"         Tub of gin ................ 1 18 0  
"Dec.    24. Tub of gin ................ 1 18 0"

A fairly good year's work in smuggled goods for a single customer.

A Smuggler's Diary.

In the days when Farmer George sat upon the throne of England and the United States of America were yet a-making; when Clive and Warren Hastings were busy laying the foundations of British Empire in India, and Captain Cook was seeking new countries in Southern seas; at such time as Nelson rose to fame upon the ocean and the Iron Duke upon the land, there lived and throve on the southern seaboard of the Isle of Wight a certain fisherman, farm-hand, and smuggler, Robert Wheeler by name.

Wheeler was a man of parts and of some little local importance. He owned a boat, fatted a pig or two yearly, and did an extensive trade in smuggled gin. School Boards were yet undreamed of and popular education barely existed in name; nevertheless, Robert contrived to acquire a little learning, and in a crabbed, crooked fist he kept a rough day-book, or diary, wherein he noted down from time to time some of the more important business transactions of his life.

To the end he was unable to spell his own name correctly and always wrote it as he pronounced it— Whiller. But there is no doubt it should have been Wheeler, for the Wheelers of Chale Bay are a numerous family even unto this day, when a local cricket eleven has been known to contain half a dozen of them.

Robert Wheeler's diary is still extant, and a few extracts from it may not be uninteresting.

They were stirring times in which Wheeler lived. The first year of his written record saw Boston Harbour black with British tea and the colonies of North America breaking into open revolt. Before the book closed, France had passed from a seething mass of unrest to some sort of settled government under the First Empire, and the Little Corsican had sent more than one thrill through the Isle of Wight and along the whole south coast of England by threats of invasion. Of all this Robert Wheeler says never a word. His is a purely domestic diary, dealing with the purchasing price of the gallon loaf, the selling price of a gallon of gin, the conveyance of prawns to the London market, the rates of wages paid for various kinds of farm service, and the cost of brewings of home-made ale.

Here and there he speaks of a smuggling adventure, and once he refers to the purchase of a weekly paper as a noteworthy event, but not a word does he say, from first to last, of momentous affairs transpiring in the great world outside, nor is there the slightest indication of any perturbation on the part of himself or his fellow islanders at the chances of war or the threats of invasion. Even the naval mutiny at Portsmouth, of which he must have heard a good deal, is passed over in silence, although he tells of large catches of mackerel disposed of in that town. It is true he lived in "lotos land "—the Garden Isle of England, where to-morrow is still as good as to-day—but we cannot suppose that he was entirely indifferent to all these external things. We can only assume that this diary, being pre-eminently a private affair, was limited strictly to private concerns.

The first entry bears date

1773

'Made Farmer Phillips of Roud a corn line, waid 20 pd. at threepence a pd. 5s.'

From which it would appear that to his other callings he added that of rope-making.

On October 1, in the same year, he

'Bargened with Farmer Moorman at North Grounds for James Whiller, and was to give him to pound fifteen shillings. 2*l.* 15*s.* 0*d.*'

This would be the hire of an indoor farm-servant in those days, probably an under-carter, and in this case, in all likelihood, a son or near relative of Robert.

At the present day in most parts of the country the indoor farm-hand has disappeared. Where he still survives, his annual wage, equivalent to the 2l. 15s. paid to James Wheeler, is from 16/. to 241. for young horse-keepers, with board and lodging, or 10s. a week in lieu of board in the Fens.

On October 9 he writes: 'Had a sack of peas at Pile (Pyle) 18s.' At four bushels to the sack the price does not differ materially from that paid to-day, when peas sell at 32s. per quarter of eight bushels.

Without a day named he records at the end of the year:

'Killed my pig, weid eleven score and four pounds. In December 1772 I killed a pig waid ten score wanting three pounds.'

There was a complaint not long ago that Isle of Wight pigfeeders persisted in feeding their swine in such a way as to produce good solid hunks of white fat bacon, in spite of the fact that middle-class purchasers, anxious for a good breakfast dish, wanted something streaky or lean. Robert Wheeler's ten score pig, however, would be nothing extraordinary, considering that present day cottagers feed up pigs to anything from ten to twenty score, the small ones selling at 9s. a score and the large ones at 7s., or thereabouts.

On December 5 there is an entry of a transaction with William Lock of Niton:

'Paid Willum Lock at Niton six shillings as the full contents of all demands of a bill due to him by me.'

On the same date he notes that he

'Bouth at Walpen a pig. Gave half a ginney for him, 10*s.* 6*d.*'

A young pig this, to fill the place of the one just converted into bacon, and at a price considerably lower than it could be had for now, when young pigs for feeding, bought in open market, are usually 'guinea' pigs.

On December 21 the Walpen waggon brought him

'A quater of chalder of coals, for which paid seven shillings and threepence.'

The exact quantity of coals thus purchased by Robert Wheeler is hard to come at, authorities differing as to the contents of a chalder. That measure of capacity, like many other weights and measures in England, was given a varying value in different parts of the country. Taken at 25 cwt., the value accorded it in modern table books, the price of coal works out at 23s. a ton, as against the 30s. now charged in the same locality.

His next recorded transaction carries us on to

1774,

when there is a characteristic entry with some equally character istic arithmetic.

TO DO


'March 6.—I reseid of my wife won pound twelf and sixpence R' , , § ee 'She reseid of Mr. Shoter thirteen shillings . . : ° . 13 0 19 0 ' March 9.—Had 18 shillings more of her . , 18 0 1 16 O 'Due toshe . ' , : , 16 0

The true inwardness of this transaction is past finding out. It seems to imply that long before a Married Woman's Property Act was thought of Mrs. Robert Wheeler of Chale had a separate estate, that she advanced to her husband 1*l.* 12*s.* 6*d.*, at the same time receiving on his account from Mr. Shoter the sum of 13*s.*, which should have left due to her from her husband 19*s.* 6*d.* Disdaining odd ha'pence, he sets down the balance as 19*s.* He then borrows an additional 18s. and enters the total debit as 1*l.* 16*s.* How the final amount comes to be 16*s.* it is impossible to decide, unless it may be regarded as a mistake for the 1*l.* 16*s.* repeated from above.

On April 3, in the same year, we get a glimpse of an eighteenth century fisherman's transactions with a firm of London fish salesmen, to which is added a note suggesting some uneasiness of mind on the part of the fisherman as to their bona fides.

'April 3, sent eight hundred and a quarter prans to London to Mr. Antony Brown and Son, Salesman, tem street, ner Billinsgate London. Not payd for.'

Subsequently his mind was eased as to the honesty of Brown and Son, 'Billinsgate,' but he was somewhat doubtful as to the profitableness of the transaction. He writes:

'I reseved nine shillings, which is all. d. 'I payd for a basket to pack them . ' . 4 'I payd caridge to Southampton . : se 'I payd for salt for boilen them . , : = 'I payd for a letter come from London . i

So that he had as the net result of this transaction the modest sum of 7*s.* 2*d.*, which is little enough when one remembers that prawns are now sold at Ventnor in season at from 4*s.* to 6*s.* a hundred, with no carriage to be deducted, or to London dealers, when scarce, at 1*l.* per hundred. Unfortunately for Wheeler, there was no Ventnor in those days. Its site was occupied by a house and mill, and London, whether by lumbering waggons or the more expeditious stage-coach, was far to seek. It is worth noting that the cost of a letter from London was considerably more than the carriage of a fair-sized package of prawns from Chale to Southampton, by the shortest route a distance of thirty miles.

In the same month he records that

'James Whiller had of Willum Jollif a new pare of shoes, 6*s.* 8*d.*'—an indication that if prawns sold ill and postage was excessive, shoes were, at any rate, proportionately cheap.

On December 16 he had a ' pare of fore pieces, 1s.'—toe-caps for his shoes. Then follows a long list of crabs and lobsters sold ;~ crabs at 13d. a pound and lobsters at 3d. To-day crabs so sold fetch 6d. a pound and lobsters 1s.

Coming to the year

1775,

we find the first entry under date February 12:

s. d, 'I payd John Burt, millier, ten shillings and fourpence 10 4 'and now owe him two bushels of wheat. . . 6 0 'and half a bushel of barley ' .; . a a x

To-day wheat would have cost him 8s. for two bushels, and barley, as then, 1*s.* 6*d.* for the haf. On February 20 he writes :

'I payd John Burt the full contents of his bill with the full demands of everything between he and I this 20 day of Feb.

1775. Rosert WHILwer.'

On March 23 he writes:

'Bought a chis for Mr. Heal Ward, 14 Ibs. and a half at threepence per lb., 3*s.* 74*d.*'

The same day he records a purchase of peas and by a 'wild goose' contra indicates another way in which a wideawake man in those days could make a little for himself.

'Payd Farmer John Gilbert of Pile 18 shillings for a sack of peas.

'Payd him towrds it 18s,

'He had a wild goose of me that I cault at sea and the account with John Gilbert was made clear between he and I.' On April 3 Wheeler records purchases of quite another kind.

8. d. j 'Bouht of Mr. Rock at Newport a bed tiken 9 yards 15 0 i

'Same time bouth 44 yard blanketen ' 9 6 'The fethers that came out of the two bolsters waid 11 pd,' |

Whether Mrs. Wheeler was engaged in re-covering her bolsters or in converting them into a bed by the help of more wild goose feathers is not stated. Some important domestic operation was undoubtedly in progress. Bed-ticking at 1*s.* 8*d.* a yard would be fairly good quality in our days; blankets at 9*s.* 6*d.* for four yards and a half somewhat inferior. The modern draper's custom of pricing his goods at odd farthings, or something worse, seems to have been already in existence, for this blanketing works out at 2*s.* lid. per yard.

In July of this year Wheeler turned his attention to the roof of his house, and there is a careful entry as to what it cost him.

* Made an end of thaten the south side of my dwelin house.

8. d.

'For three bundle spars a shilling 1 0 'Had 27 hepes of straw of Farmer Blyth of

'Legers' were most likely ledges. The barge board, given its proper spelling, is the board affixed to the gable end of a house to cover up the edge of the thatch.

Then follows an entry, the first of many of its kind and much less innocent than it looks, when one remembers the way in which these liquors were obtained.

' July 6.— Farmer Gilloz had one gallon of me. 5s.'

To-day Farmer Gilloz would have to pay something like 14s. for the same thing, only in this case it would be spirits which had contributed their lawful share to the national exchequer.

And yet how should we look too pharisaically on our Customs cheating forefathers? Their attitude towards smuggling was much the same as that of their descendants towards railway companies or the King's taxes. It was a matter of conflict between them and the law, and the smartest won. There are men still living in Wheeler's island—old men, truly—who have known what it was, in local parlance, to 'harvest a craap of tubs;' and not a few flourishing people in the Isle of Wight could trace the foundation of their fortunes to smuggled goods judiciously disposed of, if they were so inclined. But smuggling was not all profit. One can realise something of the chagrin with which Robert Wheeler made the following entry, in the year 1776.

'March 29.—Gorge Brite, Barney Hale and myself was robbed of our money on board a Dutch galiot hoy to the valey of seven pounds and fourteen shillings.'

Detestable Dutchmen, to have taken such advantage of these confiding islanders! Picture 'Gorge Brite, Barney Hale and myself' setting out with due caution and money in hand to bargain with the crew of the Dutch galiot hoy, lying in the offing, for Dutch schnaps and other contraband articles, and the woebegone manner of their return without money and without goods.

On May 25 (within six weeks of the American Declaration of Independence) Wheeler

'Bargend with Mr. Worsley for John Whiller to Micklemas after the rate of 2/. 2s. a year, and he was there twenty weeks before the bargen.'

This is less than he obtained for James Wheeler three years before, and a small sum for even an indoor servant.

In

1777 he paid, during the month of February, 6s. for 'a pare of new shoes, and on March 6, in the same year, a quarter bag of flour cost him 188*s.* 9*d.* To-day a sack of flour, fourteen score, fetches 248,

For some reason unexplained, there occurs at this point a gap of thirteen years, during which there is no entry. It is difficult to conjecture the reason of Wheeler's silence. Whether the pressgang took him, or he found an outlet for his energies in some other direction, it is impossible to decide. These thirteen years of silence were years eventful enough to have led him into many things. Almost at the moment when his entries break off England became embroiled with France, Spain, and Holland, owing to their recognition of American Independence. In the next year the long and strenuous siege of Gibraltar was begun, and Captain Cook met his death in the South Seas. Before Wheeler makes his next entry, in 1790, the Gordon Riots had come and gone, throwing the Metropolis into a state of turmoil; the siege of Gibraltar had been raised, Cornwallis had surrendered to the American colonists at York Town, legislative independence had been granted to Ireland; the war, which had cost 100,000,000/., had been concluded, the King's mind had given way, Warren Hastings had been put upon his trial, and the French Revolution had deluged France with blood.

From these matters of world importance we are brought back by Wheeler's diary in

1790

to the ordinary commonplaces of everyday life, in the form of an extraordinarily large catch of mackerel. It must have been a good fish year, for he records three big catches. Chale Bay mackerel are still popular in the Isle of Wight, and in a good season waggon loads of the silvery fish, fresh from the sea, are hawked in the island towns at six to eight a shilling. Wheeler's first entry this year gives the day of the week, as well as the day of the month.

'June 15 (Tuesday).—John Whiller, Robert Spanner, James Spragg, and myself with two boats carried between us upward of 3,000 mackerel to Portsmouth. Sold them about 1/. 38. a hundred.'

At 120 to the hundred this would mean something like 281., and is 8s.a hundred above what can be got for them at the present time.

A fortnight later he says:

'June 29.—In the morning we caught 1,100 mackerel and sold 800 and a large turbut, 16 or 20 pd. caught with the mackerel, to Jacob Cooper for 15s. a hundred, and 6*s.* 6*d.* for the turbut. In the evening caught 300 mackerel more. Sold them as we could.'

The mackerel in this instance came down to present day prices, and the turbot at fourpence per pound was considerably under.

'June 30.—In the morning we caught 300 more. On the 29th there was a large qwontey seen to play inthe evning. I saw the bay was full with it. Took for all my part for helping, 7/, 10s, And for my boat at times, 1/. 7*s.* 6*d.*'

So that for three days' work and use of his boat Wheeler netted nearly 91. Not a bad mackerel harvest.

Coming to

1793, the year in which the scaffold ran red with the blood of Louis XVI. and his ill-fated queen, Robert Wheeler merely notes the rate of wages paid for harvest work. He writes :

'August.—Began my month at Walpen for Farmer Dyer. Had for my month 2/. 12s.'

In

1794 he tells us that he began his month with the same farmer on July 29, and that this year his wife and two boys, James and John, 'leased nineteen bushel of wheat.'

This was the year of the 'glorious first of June,' when, in the English Channel, Lord Howe took seven French ships and sank one, and it may well have been that Wheeler heard the thunder of his guns.

To 'lease' wheat was of course to glean it, the term leasing being still much more common in rural England than 'gleaning.' The thing signified, however, has almost disappeared. The frugal farmer to-day prefers to have his fields well raked. At the present time if the amount to be leased is less, the wages earned are more, 5/., double the amount paid to Wheeler, being the rate of pay for a month's harvesting.

The next year the harvest was a month later, but 'a fine dry harvest as ever was known.' Wheeler did not begin his month until August 24, this time with Farmer Watts of Gatten, and he had for it 2/. 12*s.* 6*d.*; but he had previously put in several days 'at reep' for other employers, by which he managed to earn 2s.a day. The day being practically from dawn to dusk, nobody would consider him overpaid.

On November 30 of this year, Wheeler notes that he paid 2*s.* 24*d.* for the gallon loaf. A gallon of bread to-day sells for tenpence. In January, June, and October of this year Wheeler 'had from Mrs. King' various quantities of malt and hops, ranging from 14 bushels of malt and half a pound of hops to a bushel of malt and a quarter of a pound of hops. This with a view to home-brewed ale, of which he had four or five brewings a year.

Following upon this are charges for repairing boat and for a bed rail and testers. For a skim cheese of seven pounds he paid 1*s.* 9*d.*

In February

1796

he duly sets forth that he

'Measured a deal plank which measured s. d. 32 ft. at 1*s.* 4*d.* per squaretimber cometo 4 10 'Had out of it 24 iron R , R . 0 8

'6*s.* 3*d.* between John and | :; _-s

The arithmetic is wrong as usual, but the fact remains that by a windfall he makes 3*s.* 3*d.* He and his companions would be old shore-walkers, and in some of his peregrinations he had picked up this bit of wreckage, a waif from the sea.

Wheeler mentions that this year wheat sold for 29/. a load. To-day a load of wheat—five quarters—sells for 7/. 10s.

On March 27 he "payd David Jones 1/. for a quarter bag of flour." In 1777 it was 18*s.* 9*d.* In 1901 flour sells for 248. the sack.

In April of this year (1796) the gallon loaf sold for 1*s.* 94*d.*, fresh butter for 1ld.a pound, and cheese for 74d. On June 8, Wheeler paid 1*l.* 8*s.* 6*d.* for half a bag of flour. This year mackerel came early and were less plentiful. There are several entries concerning them.

'May 20.—John and I and Robert Sprack carried 1,600 mackerel to Portsmouth and sold them at 1/. 8s. for 120.'

This is a better price than in 1793.

'May 23.—John Whiller, William Wood, and Robert Sprack carried 800 more, sold at 1/. 10s. for 120.

' May 25.—John Whiller and Robert Sprack carried to Portsmouth 1,430, but we bought 700 of Farmer Peter, gave 18*s.* 8*d.* a hundred, and sold all at 1/. 7*s.* 6*d.* a hundred.'

So that they did very well not only out of the people of Portsmouth but out of Farmer Peter, who paid them 3/. for taking his fish to Portsmouth and selling them there.

In these days the Chale Bay fisherman loads his mackerel upon a waggon, and drives them a few miles to the thriving watering-places of Ventnor, Shanklin, and Sandown. In the latter half of the eighteenth century his market for a big catch was as far afield as Portsmouth, a sail of some hours.

On May 30 he says, 'There came a hard gale of wind at S. and S.W. which cut everything up very much.' The sou'-wester still causes havoc at Chale, bringing with it rough seas and heavy swells. It probably cut up the mackerel fishing with other things, and there being nothing further to do in this direction, Robert sits down to count up his share of the profits, which were not inordinately large. He says:

'June 1.—Reseved for catching and for £ s. d. use of my boat for carrying mackerel to

Portsmouth : ' , . 818 O 12 0 'For prans .; ; : ' — om

On July 15 he pays 30s. for half a bag of flour, and at the same time purchases two bushels of malt and a pound of hops. A larger brewing than in 1795.

On September 28, this year, he mentions that the gallon loaf sells at 1*s.* 4*d.*, which is considerably cheaper than in the previous year, and for a quarter of a bag of flour he gives 12*s.* 3*d.* On December 16 flour sells at 2*l.*. 8*s.* a bag. Just double what it has been making in 1901.

About this time he had between fifty and sixty bushels of potatoes in Farmer Urry's ground, 'set to halves'— an ordinary arrangement in those days, by which fresh ground was broken up, the planter finding labour and seed, the farmer the land, and the two sharing the produce equally between them.

In

1797

—a year memorable for the defeat of the Spanish fleet at St. Vincent; a black St. Valentine's Day, owing to the Bank of England suspending cash payment through having advanced so much money to the Government; the naval mutiny at Portsmouth and the Nore; and the defeat of the Dutch at Camperdown—Wheeler notes that, on January 30, he 'had of Waterworth of Newport the "Salisbury Journal."'

In these days of many periodicals we should scarcely deem the purchase of a weekly newspaper worth recording in a diary. It was otherwise in the eighteenth century. At that time newspapers were scarce articles and the price prohibitive, except to the well-to-do.

A copy of the paper Wheeler bought — the very issue — still lies at Salisbury. A modest-looking, heavy-typed, four-page paper, fourteen inches by nineteen, set three columns to the page and sold at 4*d.*

The list of contents for January 23, 1797, the current issue when Wheeler's purchase was made, was as follows:

'Despatches from Major-General Graham, commanding the troops in the Leeward Islands.

'Extract of a letter from his Excellency the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland to his Grace the Duke of Portland.

'Narrative and affidavit made by Captain Warren, of the brig Mary of Bristol, taken off Scilly by the frigate Cocardi Naztonale.

'Admiralty News.

'The Queen's Birthday.

'The action between the Portland Packet and a French ship.

'Information respecting the French fleet.

'Births and deaths.

'Copy of a letter from Rear-Admiral Harvey, dated on board Prince of Wales, Port Royal Bay, Martinique, December 4, 1796.

'Copy of a letter from Sir E. Pellew, Captain H.M.S. Indefatigable, dated January 17, 1797.

'Copies of letters from Lord Bridport and other officers of H.M. ships.

'Local news and other interesting paragraphs.

*' Advertisements.'

About the same date Wheeler paid several sums for postage, a contemplation of which tends to make one grateful for the penny post. He says:

=

- Oks

'To carrer five times payd post.' Ditto three times 'Ditto two times

mW 2

Postage at eightpence a time must have been a serious bar to correspondence, unless the writer had a long purse or was fortunate enough to have a friend privileged to frank his letters. The difference between those days, when a letter from Chale to London cost 8*d.*, and these, when a letter may be sent half round the world for a penny, is great.

Close upon this comes, not inappropriately, the copy of a letter sent to a London salesman, brief, explicit and courteous. Had Wheeler lived in our time he would doubtless have had a letter book and a copying press:

'Cheal, Isle of Wight: March.

'Sir,—I send this basket of prans to you to sell for me. —Your most humble servant, Robert Whiller.'

In May he paid for part of a mackerel net 6*l.* 11*s.* 10*d.*—a substantial set-off against the profits of mackerel fishing. His new net does not seem to have been very profitable, for the only fishing entry this year is:

'May 24.—Calt no mackrel. We have seen a little play but have always had a surff of a sea. This Wed night a hard dry wind, E. and 8. at eight o'clock.'

He further states with reference to fishing gear: 'I found four pounds of cork and fourteen stones to the line and James Lowe was two days puttin it to the line and Thomas Phillips and I the same.'

On June 28, two days before Parker was hanged for inciting the mutiny at the Nore, Wheeler indicates another source of income open to an enterprising man at that time:

'Shipt 1 tun of copperus.

'July 11.—Shipt 3 tun more at 7*s.* 6*d.* a tun.

'Reseved 1/. 10s. from Mr. Gooden, Brixton.'

'Copperus' is a form of pyrites, washed out of the cliffs of the lower Greensand. Tons of it lie along the beach in various parts of the Isle of Wight. Collected and put on board small vessels it was sent to chemical works and made into vitriol. In former days ' copperus' was largely collected by the people living along the south coast of the island.

On July 2 there is copied into the book an account against Mr. Burt of moneys due to Wheeler, including several dressmaking items, indicating that Mrs. Wheeler was no less accomplished than her husband. There is also a plank to be paid for, and two items of smuggled gin. The price for the latter suggests that smuggling was much more profitable, financially, than honest seamstressing.

'July 2.—Mr. Burt to Robert Whiller.

£ es. d. ' Makin two gounds for Mr. Burt's two daughters 1 2 'Makin two gounds . ' , : ' 1 4 'Fittina gound ,; , . R 2 'Makin a gound . R : , : 1 2 'Fittina gound ss. : ' . .; 4 ' For a plank ' . ' , ' , 2 0

'For a gallon of gin . , , . 'Dittoatub . , , ' : . - 1

ho Cr ~~ —) -

The book is full of items similar to the last two, but nothing 

would be gained by repeating them. Compared with the present

price of gin—1l4s. to 16s. a gallon—these smuggled Hollands were cheap.

Harvest was earlier this year. Wheeler says:

'Begun my month on August 15 at Walpen. Had for it 2*l.* 12*s.* 6*d.*'

Previous to this he had had one day 'at reep' at Westside, and had drawn his 2s. for it on August 13. He notes that it was 'a fine harvest. Scarce any rain all harvest. This year he threshed 114 bushels of leased wheat—only about half as much as in 1794. On October 17 he says, ' Gave for gallon loaf 1*s.* 6*d.*; the week before 1s. 8*d.*'

In

1798,

the year of the Irish Rebellion, the battle of Vinegar Hill on June 21, and the battle of the Nile on August 1, Wheeler's entries relate principally to prawns and smuggled goods.

The prawn season runs from February to April, and from the time we saw him drawing 7*s.* 2*d.* from Antony Brown and Son, Thames Street, near Billingsgate, for eight hundred and a quarter prawns onward, there are records of many such transactions at better prices. As most of this business was carried on through Mr. Worsley, a farmer bearing a well-known island name, it is possible that the rise in price may be in a measure accounted for by more competent business handling. Prices still only ranged from 5*s.* to 6*s.* a hundred, but the aggregate amount was not to be despised. Wheeler says:

'April 14.—Reseved money for the fish.

a @ 'Robert Whiller 9 9 43 ' John Whiller 8 16 14 ' William Searle 8 8 Of'

A lump sum of 10*l.* would be a very nice addition to the income of a struggling fisherman, but no lump sums, gained honestly, had power to wean them from the more risky but also more profitable trade in smuggled gin.

On October 12 he bought a clock from Richard Denner, Newport, for 7*l.* 7*s.* One, in all probability, of the 'grandfather' type.

About this time he sells to Farmer Burt one gallon of gin for 5*s.* 6*d.* and a tub for 1*l.* 2*s.*, and grumbles somewhat at the amount these duty-free cargoes cost him. He writes: 'Payd 8l. 13s. for 94 tubs 18*s.* 6*d.* which is too much.'

An indication this of the amount of trade done. The profit, 3*s.* 6*d.* a tub, or 33*s.* on the cargo, is not so much, considering the risks run. Writers of smuggling yarns seldom get down to the pounds, shillings and pence of these transactions. That would be to take the romance away.

In

1800, reckoned by him, no doubt, as the beginning of a new century, Wheeler makes special mention of the price of provisions :

'February 23.—The gallon loaf sells at 2*s.* 6*d.*, Irish butter at 1*s.* 1*d.* per pd., butcher's meat at 64d. the pd., hog's meat at 94d. and 10d. the pd., lard 8d., ordinary cheese 4*d.*, West country cheese 8d., potatoes 2*s.* 6*d.* to 2*s.* 7*d.* a bushel, men's shoes 10s. a pair, barley for malt 3/. per quarter, wheat 291. to 301. a load.'

As already stated, a load of wheat—five quarters—sells to-day for 7*l.* 10*s.* Wheeler follows up this entry with a slight personal allusion :

'Being a fast day I sold Old Dame Stephens, my wife's grandmother, upwards of ninety-one years of age, half a gallon loaf for

1*s.* 4*d.*'

The gallon loaf sold for the time at 2*s.* 8*d.* During the year its highest price was 3*s.* 1*d.*

His reason for recording the fact that he sold his wife's grandmother half a gallon loaf on a fast day at full market value is not apparent.

On May 28 he caught 74 cwt. of mackerel. On December 18 he sets down, 'Due to Robert Whiller for killing a pig, 1*s.*'

In

1801, the year of the union with Ireland and the defeat of the Danish fleet at Copenhagen, he pays, on August 4, 1/. 18s. for a chalder of coals, 9*s.* a chalder more than he paid in 1773.

On September 15 and 16 he threshed 16 bushels of leased wheat. On October 10 the gallon loaf fetched 2s. ld. On October 2 he 'bout at Lymington fair 14 cwt. of chis at 2*l.* 16*s.* per ewt. and ten dozen brooms at 1*s.* 6*d.* the dozen.'

At that time a journey to Lymington, on the edge of the New Forest, must have been an important event, and Lymington Fair

a great gathering for Hampshire people. Cheese to-day makes from 40s. to 50s. a hundredweight. The brooms—besoms—are still dealt in by the gipsies of the New Forest, and sold in Hampshire at 2*s.* 6*d.* adozen. Mr. Baring-Gould has made the world familiar with the title of ' Broom Squire.'

1802

saw the Peace of Amiens and the National Debt of England raised to 520,000,000/. It also saw Wheeler paying out

s. d, 'For cloth for shirts '; : . 12 O 'For gloves. ' ' , ' . 2 0 * For four handkerchiefs . 3 0 ' Pare of trousers and maken 8 0 ' Buttons for westcote , . F; 4'

This year 'the measure of copperus at Atherfield Rock was 57 bags, 1*l.* 0*s.* 9*d.*' On March 6, he says, ' I Jaid out four bushels of lime and half a hundred bricks for reparing the house on John Whiller's account. 1*l.* 10*s.*'

On May 5 for a quarter of barley at Gatten he pays 1*l.* 5*s.* 6*d.* for 'a pan of hog's lard waid 27 pds. at 6*d.* a pd., 13*s.* 6*d.*'

On July 23 he had two pigs, 16s. each, 1/. 12s. Previously he had purchased pigs for half a guinea each. This year there is an entry illustrating the tenure on which these fishermen held their cottages :

'Pade November 8 at North Grounds for the lord's rent for four years for father's house, four shillings.'

In 1803 war was again declared against France, several thousand British tourists on French soil were thrown into prison, a hundred thousand troops lay at Boulogne waiting to invade England, and Robert Emmett—grandfather of Mrs. Louis Botha—headed a new rebellion in Ireland. Wheeler's principal entry this year is 'Willam Whiller killed my pig waid 13 score 15.' He mentions that it was a bad fish year, for he began fishing in March and ended in May, and he and his partner only earned 6l. 8s. between them.

On January 14, 1804,

he 'bouth a quarter of a sack of flour for 11*s.* 3*d.*' On January 17

for a sack of barley at Westside he paid 12*s.* 6*d.* On March 6 a quarter of a sack of fine flour cost him 9*s.* 9*d.* On February 15, 18, and 19, he 'made a load of fus (furze) faggots at Kingston at Farmer Dyer's.' By April 6 the price of flour had risen, a quarter of a sack costing 10*s.* 3*d.*

This year he was busily engaged in smuggling, and his book has the following among other entries :

£e d.

'March 26. Tub of brandy 117 O Tub of gin 118 0

A fairly good year's work in smuggled goods for a single customer.

The other entries this year include '12 pounds of brown sugar at 7d.=7s., a quart cup, 8d., and 'for four days' work in harvest, 10s.,' a rise in price on previous years.

In

1805,

the year of Ulm, Trafalgar and Austerlitz, he has only one entry: 'Left to pay at Gatten, 2*l.* 2*s.*' And with that his book abruptly ends.
