AN ISLE OF WIGHT SNUGGLING CASE.

At the sitting of the Isle of Wight magistrates at Newport, on Saturday, David Cotton, fisherman, of Brixton, was charged with being on board a vessel named the Cloud, within a port of the United Kingdom, with a device adapted for the purpones of smuggling, on the inst.—Mr. Henderson, Collector of tuatoais at West Cowes, prosecuted; Mr. Douglas Ford, of Portsmouth, defended.—Mr. Hendeison, in hia opening address, explained the nature of the offence, and pointed out that the punishment was forfeiture of the Teen! and the infliction of a penalty not exceeding £lOO upon every person found on board. On the vessel in question OMB found a warp 13 fathoms in length, with about 73 slings attache& On searc hi ng the crock a large sinker was also found attached, and these he would prove by experienced officers were demean adapted for the puiposes of smuggling —The following evidence was then called: —Lieorge French deposed: I am chief boatman In charge of the Reath detachment, St. Catherine's Point station. 1 th.t eatly on the morning of Friday, the Lth in-t •my attention was called to the movemeuts of a small Tinsel proceeding eastward. I had the crew called cut and approached her; Joseph Path was with me. I found her with her head to the north west on the rocks at Puckaster Point. I went ou board, and on s-archinit the vessel found a stray warp with tub attached. These slings are newer wed for any other purpose than running tubs. It was lying part on the hatch and the other part in the hold. One of the hatches was off. It is a bran new warp, including the @limo. It was wet when found, and bad been lately in the water. I consider this warp is a device adapted for smuggling. Ido not consider it cold be used for any purpose connected with fishing or any other legitimate purpose. I have searched the wieck since then and found the sinker produced (a large piece of granite with rope ' similar to the slings attached.) It is used for sinking • warn with tuba atta-hed to it. I have seen several warp. of the kiud na -ci for sinking goods and running tubs. I have seen seizures made whilst in one of the cruisers for the dete ton of smugglers. In making these seizures I have a. en warps exactly like the one produced; fitted in the same way. I recognise the prisoner, whom I found lying across the hatches, with his feet hanging over the vessel's side, drunk. He could give no account of hienielf. The vessel was in a bad condition; fast filling with water. I made him a prisoner on auspi.den of smuggling. After I had made him a prinoner he said, "I do not care _; we have got the tubs all right." I took him t . the watch-house. At this time. I did not know his name. He told me John Chambers, of Freshwater. was with him, but it has sines turned out that he was of Yarmouth. I found out the name of the was the Cloud, of Cowes, which was painted on the piece of wreck produced.— By Mr. Ford: I bane been in the coastguard eighteen years. I was never a fisherman. lam not accustomed to trawling. I can swear the piece of rope produced could not be used for trawling, because I have seen trawling gear and stood alongside while it has been fitted up. I have never actually trawled. I found. trawl net on bawd the vessel on the deck. I have rope, stopping min a stopper; o us r ed . f r o u r nn sto in p g pie ro g pe a trawl stopper might be used for trawling; not 70. It could not housed for the purpose of trawling, as it is not fit for • ground rope,• line net, or • trawl rope, because of the large .number of stops. I have never seen stopper ropes of thet thickness. 'Mere is no reason why a rope of this description could not be used for • stopper, because you can use any rope On board • ship for • stopper. Thee is no doubt it was used for the purpose of stopping the tubs. The rope produced was much too large for • stopper on boald a little thing like the Cloud. A three-inch could be used for the purpose of • stopper. A three-quarter inch was too large for so small a vessel. Joseph Petty was with me when prisoner made the statement. It was made in the watch-room in reply li, a question. I asked the prisoner where he came from, and where be was going. That was about two hours after I took him from the vessel. Ho was sober enough to make a statement. Two hours before he was so druuk that he could give no account of himself. The vessel went to pieces. I believe the owner of the vessel possessed a &barmen's license. There was not a strong wind blowing that night. There was a little ripple on the roe which might have over a vessel of that size.-By the Cheirmen : It was • small vessel of about ten tons.-Joseph Petty, boatman in the Coastguard Service at St. Catherines Point Station, reantieg at Reath detachmeet, gave similar evidence to the previous witness, adding : The statement respecting the landing of the tuba was on beard the boat. Prisoner was sober when in the watch-house, and knew what he was doing. Prisoner said he had tended them in the bay, but he did not name any bay. Prisoner said be had come from Alum Bay, but nothing more was said to lii, kunwledge.-By Mr. Ford: This was a clear night, and the ship was on the rocks. There was • little bit of a "chop" on. The vessel was about six or eight tone, but theme would not go over when he saw it. There was not a stiff breeze when he boarded the vessel, about half past three o'clock that morning. There was a light breeze at one o'clock, but there was not sufficient sea to wraith over the vessel. He was positive that the statement previously mentioned was made on the boat about minutes after they had left the veesel. French heard the convolution the boat and ii. the watch-house too. lam not accustomed to trawling. The rope produced could not be used for trawiug because the slings would he in the way, and It would be too awkward. 'I they were not strong etiough ter st.ppers. A stopper is not used for the purpose of easiug the main rope. I cannot give any reason why the rope could not be used for trawlieg purposes.- By the Chairman : There were no fish found in the boat.-Crose-examined by Mr. Ford: I steeed oh, board half an hour until told by my , superior officer r. leave. There was no water where ' the net was. 'I here were three feet of water in the hold.-Thomae Hunter, chief officer in the coestguari service at East Cowes., deposed : I have been in the coastguard service close upon seven and twenty years. Of that period I bare been from 11 to 12 years in the Isle of Wight. I have bad considerable experience with smuggling in the Island. The drag warp produced is ex.ctly eituilar to what I Wive seen used for smuggling purposes. I will not swear it has been used for nothing else -By the Chairmen: I here net found the sumo kind of rope on board other vessels besides those engaged in smuggling. -By Mr. Ford : I have trawlmg rep. asedly. The rope produced cod not be used for such purposes, because such stops are not required for trawling. There may be stops used for trawling puronses, hut not suli stops as those.-John Ilaynau, ctdef-boatman in charge of Shauklin station, deposed: I have seen similar pieces of rope to that prosluael and used for the purp .so of smuggling. I hive never seen it used for other pemoses.-By Mr. Ford: I do not say it cannot be used for any other purpose..-Mr. Douglas Fold, in addreseiue the Beech for their deenee, stated that of all prosecutions the most difficult to meet were those of the Customs, which were supported by a comprehensive Act of Parliament contaiihing nearly 300 medicine. They (the Bench hat, in alditi .n to their duties me justices of the pea.te, to fulfil also to some extent the functions of a jury, and to come to an absolute conclusion upon the matter. Fast of all, did the statements of the witnesees correspond? He thought not. The first witness told them the prisoner was drunk when he went ou b and when put into the boat. Afterwards prisoner was conveyed to the watch-house, and the wittiest told them not one wort about a c .nversation taking place in the beat. Although the witnesses for the proseeution said the rope was used for the purposes of smuggling, yet of them would swear positively that it could not be used for any other purpose.-The Chairman: Then you see the Act is stringent ; it does not say it shall be used for any purpoec, but "any device ad ivied" for that one pursuit. I cannot see how much further you can go, the words are so stringent. - Mr. Ford agreed that the words were stringent, but still it did not di away with the fact that this piece of rope was on board for the purp we of assisting the prisoner in his business as a fisherman. He pointed out that because rope was to be adapted for the purposes of smuggling they were not uecesserily botind to come to the conclusi. n that the prisoner was guilty. Doubtless the rope might be used for emuggling, but he ale'. contended that it was frepoottly used for purposes of trawling, to prevent too great a strain loon the net. He reviewed the evidence and urged that the facts were consistent with the theory advanced thet the rope was used for the purpose of trawling, the owner of the vessel possessing a fisherman's license, a tr.wl net being found oa board, and the uhcontreverible statement that the rope and its appendages might have been used for other purposes. They were there on very unequal terms, being hedged in and aromd by the str.ngent wording of this Act of Perlirment. He commented upon the serious penalty should they convict his client, and urged that th. re was a strong doubt in the cam, , of which the prisoner should have the benefit. Mr. Ford submitted that according to the section they must have some proof of the knowledge or intention that it was used for the purpose. Even supposing it had been a yacht or any other vessel, would it necessarily be held that because it bed throe things OD . board it could be brought under the purview of that Act of Parham...et aed the owner he suhjerted to a penalty of £lou ? He then c tiled the following witness: -George Barber, residing at Porten .u.h, deli. tied: I have had ;15 years' experience as a 11.-herman. The rope prodeced is used for trawling purposes on " tasty" or rocky ground. There are stoppers upon it and dnuhleetoppera The kick rope was the main or standing rope, with single and double etnppers. The bigger the vessel the burger the stopper required. The number of at ppers depended on the ground where they were going to trawl. I have seen hundreds of midi roe*, used for trawling purposes-The Chairman: Hove you ever seen a trawling role with steip is pla.ed so close together? -Witness: I have seen 40 stoppers on a rope.-By Mr. Ford: I do not koow how !limy stoppers there are on the repe pr. eloce.l.-Mr. Heneers In a fishing smack of six ton., what would be the length of a trawling rope ?-Witn. is: It is to the depth of water it is in tor. -Q. Supposing t wen ty fathoms of water? A. GO f Ahem ot rope.-Q. Ins rope of 31 fa•homs. h.w may steep-re would be used? A. It would very likely bane 40 or 50 etoppers if on very rough grouod. If the 'reeled was deer it would not require ant at all. I have never seen a stray warp-The Chairman (Mr. T. I.each): We are decidedly and unanirn usly of opi that there must be • conviction lit the tools. We think the Commiseioners will he sell-fled by our infiietihe a penalty of .ClO and .C 4 bd. costs. Pr.soner will hedet •Ine.l until the money is paid.- -John Chermao. was charged with the same offenee.-David Cotton, prisoner in the precedieg cote. the dust wither.' celled, and. haying b. to cautiveml, the clerk (Mr. Fardell) was examined be Hr.

A SMUGGLER'S DIAE Is " Longman's Magazine " for January , Mr \ V ; H .

' ., ; , _ Wheeler . ' says Mr Hunt , was a man of parts and of some little local importance .. He owned a .. boat , fatted ; a- pig ' -oe two yearly , .. and did- an extensive Hade in ' smuggled gin . ' Schobl-Bbardi-were- yet-undreamed of and- popular education barely existed in name ; . nevertheless , Robert , contrived to acquire a litllo learning , and iu a . crabbed , crooked fist lie kept a rough . day-book , or diary , wherein he noted down from time to time eome of tlio ; more important-business transactions of . his life . To . the end he was unable to ' spoil his own name • correctly , and- always wrote it as ho pronounced il—Whiller . But-there is-no doubt it should have been Wheeler , for the Wheelers of Chale Bay are a- numerous family even unto this day , . when a " local cricket eleven has-been known to contain'half'a dozen of them . Robert Wheeler ' s diary is ELill estant , -Thcy were stirring times - in . winch . Wheeler livcil . The . first year of his written record saw Boston Harbour Mark with British tea . and I'lio colonies of North America breaking into open revolt . Before the book closed , France , had passed from a seething mass of unrest , to some , sort of settled . government under the I'irst Empire , and tlio Liltio Corsira . n had sent more fhan ' one thrill through the Isle of Wifhi n iid along the'whole south coast of England by threats • ot invasion . Of all this - llcbert- Wheeler says never a . worda / . Jlis is . a purely domestic diary , dealing with' the . purchasing price of the gallon loaf , the sailing prico of a- gallon of ' gin , the conveyance of prawns to the London market ; the r ' atea of wages paid for various . kinds of farm . sorvic' ' , and the cost ofJirewings of nomo-maue ale . .
