# The Three Little Pigs

From the archived newsletters of the [Shanklin & District History Society](https://shanklinhistory.net/newsletters.html), I learn that an early version of the *Three Little Pigs* that first appeated in the [1853 edition](https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=alsCAAAAQAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Popular+Rhymes+and+Nursery+Tales+1853&hl=en&newbks=1&newbks_redir=0&sa=X&redir_esc=y#v=snippet&q=SHANKLIN&f=false) of J. O. Halliwell's *Popular Rhymes and Nursery Tales*  was collected on the Island, and set in Shanklin.

According to a [note](https://isleofwightfolkarchive.co.uk/Christmas%20Bumper%20Box.pdf) on "Dave and Anwyl's *Isle of Wight Folk Archive*" website 

> The Three Little Pigs is amongst many stories and tales that were collected by Henry Smith. It is thought that his aunt Amelia from Arreton, who used to entertain people with stories, may havetoldthisone. It refers to the Shanklin Fair which would have probably have been the Hiring / MopFair just afterMichaelmas. The fair would have been at the beginning of October which also relates to therebeingapples on the ground. It also talks of the Mr Smith’s Home Field and Merry Garden at Languard.

The claim that the tale was submitted to Halliwell some time earlier is attested to by an acknowledgement in the preface to the 1849 edition, dated April, 1849, [p. ix-](https://archive.org/details/popularrhymesan00hallgoog/page/n14/mode/2up):

> The compiler's best thanks are due to Captain Henry Smith for the very interesting communication of rhymes current in the Isle of Wight ; ...

The Three Little Pigs

ONCE upon a time there was an old sow with three little pigs, and as she had not enough to keep them, she sent them out to seek their fortune. The first that went off met a man with a bundle of straw, and said to him, " Please, man, give me that straw to build me a house ; " which the man did, and the little pig built a house with it. Presently came along a wolf, and knocked at the door, and said,

" Little pig, little pig, let me come in." To which the pig answered, " No, no, by the hair of my chiny chin shin."

The wolf then answered to that, "Then I'll huff, and I'll puff, and I'll blow your house in."

So he huffed, and he puffed, and he blew his house in, and eat up the little pig.

The second little pig met a man with a bundle of furze, and said, " Please, man. give me that furze to build a house ; " which the man did, and the pig built his house. Then along came the wolf, and said,—

the wolf came up he said, " Little pig, what ! are you here before me ? Are they nice apples?" "Yes, very," said the little pig. " I will throw you clown one ; " and he threw it so far, that, while the wolf was gone to pick it up, the little pig jumped down and ran home. The next clav the

wolf came again, and said to the little pig, " Little pig, thers is a fair at Shanklin this afternoon, will you go?' "Oh yes," said the pig, " I will go ; what time shall you be ready?" "At three," said the wolf. So the little pig went off before the time as usual, and got to the fair, and bought a butter-churn, which he was going home with, when he saw the wolf coining. Then he could not tell what to do. JSo he got into the churn to hide, and by so doing

turned it round, and it rolled down the hill with the pig in it, which frightened the wolf so. much, that he ran home without going to the fair. He went to the little pig's house, and told him how frightened he had been by a great round thing which came down the hill past him. Then the little pig said, " Hah, I frightened you then. I had been to the fair and bought a butterchurn, and when 1 saw you. 1 got into it,

and rolled down the hill." Then the wolf was very angry indeed, and declared he iDOidd eat up the little pig, and that he would get down the chimney after him. When the little pig saw what he was about, he hung on the pot full of water, and made up a blazing fire, and, just as the wolf was coming down, took off the cover, and in fell the wolf; so the little pig put on the cover again in an instant, boiled him up, and eat him for supper, and lived happy ever afterwards.
