A chantry was established

here by Sir John Leigh, knight, and endowed with lands worth i i, 2s. 4d. per annum. The incumbent was one John Griffith, a master of
arts, who taught English grammar to
young children. But as this chantry was not
stated to have been a grammar school by foundation, it may be that teaching was only the
voluntary occupation of the chantry priest. However this may be, the chantry was founded
before the year 1548, and was partly re- endowed as a " Free Grammar School " before
1617, and 1622. It remained a real grammar school until 1813, since which date it has been concerned only with elementary education.

Godshill Church (6rf. each, towards the restoration), one of the six given by William Fitz Osbern soon after the Conquest, to his Abbey of Lyra in Normandy, and perhaps founded by him, was, according to tradition, originally built in the valley at Devil's Acre, Sheepwash, about a mile S.W. Perhaps the monks effected the change of site, attributed as usual to the devil, but of their work nothing is left. On the suppression of the Alien Priories in 1414, Henry V. gave Godshill to Sheen Priory, founded that year.
The Church, as we see it, dates from the first quarter of the 15th cent., and is, with the exception of later tasteless work, Early Perpendicular. Architecturally it is of little interest. The top stage of the tower was rebuilt in the 16th cent., and restored after being struck by lightning in 1778. The building consists of two equal aisles with short transepts—Sanctus Bell niche in S gable—and a Tower at the W. end of the N. Aisle or Nave. In the S. Porch is a tablet to Eichard Gard, whose virtues are chronicled, but not the oblique ways in which, according to Sir John Oglander, he acquired wealth. Notice the old door, and just within it a piscina. The latter is an insertion, but its left- hand side is Early English, and the sole relic of the church of the Lyra monks. The interior of the Church is fairly lined with memorials, chiefly to the Worsley family of Appuldurcombe. It may be noted that the E. and W. windows, which have apparently Decorated tracery, are really of Perpendicular date, and the arch next W. of the sacrarium is only an imitation of Early English work. On the N. wall is a copy of a picture by Eubens, "Daniel in the den of lions." The only monuments of interest are S. of the sacrarium. Sir John Leigh {temiJ. Henry VIII.) and his wife, with alabaster effigies. At his feet is the boar which killed him, and two monks as weepers. The lady {nee Hackett) whose first husband had been the last of the Fry family of Appuldur- combe, brought that property to Sir John, whose only child married Sir James Worsley, from Lincolnshire, who was Captain of Wight from 1511 to 1538.



Wight words skeet p58
The belief in supernatural influences at the erection of churches is of very early origin, and it appears to point to the period of transition from paganism to Christianity. That connected with Godshill church is, that when the materials for building were collected in a field below, they were removed, at night, to the elevated spot on which the church now stands. The field from which the building stones were removed is called the Devil's Acre.






Isle of Wight Venables
The church (of which the old tradition is told, so common elsewhere to explain the position of sacred edifices on elevated or otherwise inconvenient sites, of spirits, either good or evil, transporting the materials from the valley below during the night, until the builders were constrained to acquiesce in the change of situation) stands on an isolated knoll, whose broken sides, rich in colouring and profuse vegetation, offer many tempting studies to an artist
pp97
Godshill church was the scene, in the fourteenth century, of some of those unseemly disputes between the seculars and regulars then so common. Letters from two successive Bishops of Winchester A.D. 1307, 1340, are given in Worsley's History, complaining that the monks had taken violent possession of the church, and fortified themselves therein, holding it by force of arms against the bishop, and begging the king to interpose his authority in their behalf.
The church was struck by lightning in January 1778,
and considerably damaged. The lightning descended the tower, loosening the masonry ; and entering the church, proceeded along the whole length of the wall above the arcade to Sir John Leigh's monument, where it dislodged a portion of the mouldings, and made itsway into the ground below the east windows. Soon after this the gable fell, and continued some little time in ruins.
A grammar school was founded here by Sir Richard Worsley, in 1614 ;but though former writers speak of it as in a state of efficiency, the endowment has proved entirely
inadequate, and the intentions of the founder have ceased
to take effect. The curate for the time being has been
for some time past the nominal master of the Grammar School, and the occupier of the premises built on the site of
the old “ Chantry House ."

1850 barbers picturesque guide
GODSHILL is a picturesque village, much remarked for
the bold position of its Church, which, standing on a very abrupt hill, surrounded by the cottages of the inhabitants,
may be supposed to have given name to the place, from its erection on so commanding a site. Rustic tradition, indeed, tells that a more lowly spot was at first selected ; but that the materials employed for that purpose by day, being regularly removed, by invisible agents, to the summit of the hill during the night, the workmen at length wisely determined to save themselves further unnecessary trouble, and built the church where some supernatural authority so plainly intimated that it must be erected !



https://godshill.online/the-godshill-legend/
There have been a number of variations on the Godshill Legend. However, they all revolve around the same set of happenings over the space of a few days back in the seventh century when the largely Saxon inhabitants of the Isle of Wight were converted to the Christian faith.
The local inhabitants now needed a christian place of worship to attend. The only location at that time was the pagan site set on the top of the small hill where the church now stands. The village elders decided to build a chapel to God in a field below the site that had been used in pagan times.
It was a big community project and all the village helped to mark out the foundations on the chosen site. They built using small and large local stones gathered from wherever they could find them. At the end of the first day everyone was exhausted and went home to bed and they probably all slept very soundly.
When they returned to the building site early the following morning they discovered that everything in the field had disappeared. After a local search, they discovered everything, the stones, all of the markers and lines and all of their tools and ropes had been moved to the top of the hill. What’s more, everything was laid out at the top of the hill exactly as had been left in the field below the previous evening.
So, the day’s work was to be the moving of everything from the top of the hill back to the field below. So, after another day’s exhausting work they were back to where they were the evening before. They thought no more of it and set off home for a good night’s sleep.
You can imagine their astonishment the next morning when they found that exactly the same had happened again. Everything had been moved and laid out perfectly once more on top of the hill. They were determined the church should be in their chosen location at the bottom of the hill and again moved everything back and then continued the building work. At the end of the day, the village elders decided to post watchmen around the church to watch over the building works.
At midnight, in the dark, the watchmen started to hear rumbling sounds. They couldn’t believe their eyes. They saw the giant stones sway from side to side slowly, as if awakening. The smaller stones then started jumping and rolling up the hill, leapfrogging over each other and the various obstacles in the way. The larger stones moved slowly, swaying and rolling. Not only the stones, but marker pegs, ropes, shovels and anything related to the building of the church, flew up the hill with them. At the top of the hill, marker pegs were hammered into the layout of the church with mallets that swung themselves, and string tied itself to the pegs to form the guide for the church building layout.
After the village elders had heard what had happened, they decreed that the church would be built on the top of the hill, and that from that time on, in honour of the miracle that had happened there, the village would be named “God’s Hill”. The field below the hill where they had initially tried to build their church was from then on known as “Devil’s Acre”.

Garle, Driving tour, p60-61
Passing through the interesting little village of Godshill, we stopped to visit the church, which is situated on the summit of a steep hill.
Tradition says the building operations were begun in the valley on a part known as the Devil's Acre, but during the night all the materials were mysteriously carried up to the top of the knoll, and those concerned, taking this for an intimation that the edifice was to be erected on the hill, built it there. In the entrance porch is a memorial tablet to a worthy, Richard Gard by name, who lived in the time of Sir John Oglander. This tablet sets forth his many virtues and generous acts ; but Sir John, who knew him, describes him in his diary as a French refugee, shrewd and dishonest, and as having amassed considerable property by various base practices, such as by getting possession of title deeds of estates under colour of examining them, discovering some flaw, and then by base and fraudulent representations driving the parties to a com(osition advantageous to himself ; also by stealing cattle and placing hot loaves on their horns to make them supple, and so render it easy to alter their natural shape, in order to deceive their lawful owner, should he come to claim them.
Sir John Oglander puts rather a different complexion on his deeds to that recorded on the tablet in the church porch. One curious clause in his will was that the stone placed over his grave should \^e broken to enable him to rise the easier on the Day of Judgment



Hassell vol 2 p87-89
Godshill
The architecture is partly Gothic, but,
through the usual mode of modern beauti
fication, the whole is not to be distinguish ed. However, when we viewed it, two of
its gable ends had just fallen in, which
broke the formal appearance of its extremity, and introduced a beautiful specimen of its ancient splendour. The ivy had
twisted off many of its disagreeable angles, and added beauty to its Gothic appearance. Its present shattered state might have arisen
from its having been struck by lightning in
the year 1778, when great damage was done to it. This church was anciently
appropriated to the abbey of Lyra,in Normandy .
Upon our entering the porch [to the Church] we obſerv ed abſtracts from ſeveral acts of parliament
fixed againſt the door, and among them one that excited both our curioſity and ri
fibility ; - it was from an act made in the
ſeventh of James the Firſt , which enacts,
that every female who unfortunately in
trudes on the pariſh a ſecond illegitimate
child , ſhall be liable to impriſonment and
hard labour in Bridewell for ſix months.
· Now as the number of females on this
iſland much exceeds that of the males; and
as, from the mild temperature of the cli
mate, circumſtances frequently ariſe among
the lower ranks that render the intention
of this act of no effect ; we could not help
thinking this public exhibition of the ab
ſtract as rather a rigorous exertion of Juf
tice.
We found it was not very unuſual here for the young men , from the deficiency of numbers juſt ſpoken of, to pay their devoirs
to more than one young woman at a time ;
and as it is not poſſible for him legally to
unite himſelf to all of them , he generally
beſtows his hand on her who had firſt pre
ſented him with a pledge of their love .
This, however , is ſeldom done till the ap
proach of a ſecond pledge from the ſame
perſon renders ſuch an act of compaſſion
needful, in order to avoid the conſequences
of the tremendous anathema fixed on the
church door.

Worsley, History of the Isle of Wight, Appendix XLVII

In the Synod assembled at Oxford by Archbishop Langton, the thirteenth canon forbids the vicarage of any church to be
given to a Vicar who shall not serve the church : the fourteenth obliges those who have benefices to reside: the fifteenth appoints a sufficient portion of the benefice to be allowed for the maintenance of the Vicar : and the fortieth forbids the letting to farm , excepting it be done for some cause, which hall be approved by the Bishop.


A neglect in the observation of these canons occasioned the Bishop to collate to those churches which fell to him by lapse :
as fully appears by the register of William of Wykeham , who
collated to the Vicarage of Carisbrook , void , as he expressly says, through neglect of the constitutions of Otho and Ottoboni.
There had been great commotions in the island on this occasion,
and to what a height they rose at Godshill, are seen in Bishop  Wocdlock's Register, wherein the Monks , with their friends,
are recorded to have held the church by force : the Bishop's letter to the King on that occasion, with another on a subsequent one, are inserted in the Appendix *. The Bishop also ordered
the Dean of the island, to put the Clerk, collated by him , in possession of the church of Godshill, devolved to him , by virtue of the canon of the General Council .

There are fairy-dead counties in England, counties from which no or few fairy legends survive, particularly in the south-east. At the top of the league table is fairyless Kent, but not far behind is the Isle of Wight. To the best of my knowledge there is only one nineteenth century-legend (and nothing before) and that involved a close encounter with fairy dust. It is worth including here because it may – there is a slim chance – confirm the idea much loved of shaggy-haired anthropologists and neo-Murrayians that British ‘shamans’ (witches, fairy seers etc) used to imbibe magic mushrooms.
We are at Puckaster Cove on Wight a name that recalls, but that probably has nothing to do with, Puck. This particular account comes from a recent history of Wight Folklore and Legends by Joanne Thornton
The moon came out just then and [John] realized he was on the smooth area of Puckaster cove. He could hear tiny voices singing and on looking down towards his feet he saw several tiny people dancing in a ring. While he stood watching, one came up to him which looked like a child of about 5, the fairies began singing that this was Mr Puck. Mr Puck came up to John and climbed up his front holding onto his buttons; he came up to John’s face and shoved some brown powder up John’s nose. This made John sneeze and as he did so he shrank down to the fairy’s size.
It is not clear where this brown powder originates: but might it be from the puffball that follows? Certainly, after an encounter with a rat, John ends up on a puffball.
Following this, which for John was a very scary encounter [the rat]; the fairies resumed dancing and mushrooms began to appear in the ring, with a puffball growing in the centre. John was asked to sit upon the puff ball, while the other fairies sat on the mushrooms forming a ring around John. He suddenly noticed that 2 butterfly like wings had grown out of his back, and that he could fly up into the air. This he tried, but decided to come back down and sit back on the puffball, as he was afraid of owls or other predators.
John was clearly a prudent man. However, if the connection with the puffball seem weak in this modern summary it should be noted that the puffball is repeated again and again in different versions of this tale. The puff ball is claimed to be John’s seat assigned by Puck and is responsible for giving him wings. It also changes colour from white to brown, exploding, its spores making him again the normal size. In the earliest version known to me the powder is described as a kind of brown snuff. Puffballs do give out brown spores. Unfortunately for this theory puffballs do not seem to be hallucinogenic (having said that my source is a not always scientific site called shroomery). Any expert knowledge? drbeachcombing At yahoo DOT com
Fairies are always associated with toadstools and mushrooms: making or sitting on them. But this is the only instance I know anywhere of a fairy story including a fungus as a plot device.
27 June 2014: ANL, ‘I remember coming across a clump of luminous toadstools in the middle of my parents’ lawn when I was about ten or eleven years old. They looked rather like giant button mushrooms and were an orangey-brown colour in daylight. At night, however, they glowed a bright-green colour. I have never been able to identify the species. It looked quite magical, and I would not be surprised if some fairy lore was generated by such luminous phenomena rather than by the hallucinogenic qualities of some fungi.’ Thanks ANL!

 Dangerous ! I did my best to look calm and collected ; but I found it very necessary to steady myself with my stick, and to use all my caution, while my landlord related to me some of the popu- lar tales about the high downs and cliffs."
" Did he tell you those tales while you were standing in that dangerous spot ?"
" He did. He said there was a strip of land at the bottom of the high down that no one could ever build upon ; and the tale commonly told about it was this : —-Once upon a time a certain bishop, on horseback, whether it was bishop Boniface or not, he did not say, was benighted on the high down. Not knowing what to do, he threw the reins on the neck of his horse, that he might take his own course. The horse directly began to descend the precipitous steep."
" What! down the steep side of St. Boniface?"
" Yes ; the poor animal picked his way, as well as he could, while the bishop kept praying all the way, as he had good reason to do, that his life might be preserved. In his jeopardy he made a vow, that if ever he again set foot on level ground he would buy the place that he first trod on, for pious purposes. The horse carried his master
safely down the hill, the bishop kept his vow in purchasing the land, and it goes by the name of Bishop's Acre to this day."
" Well, that is a curious tale ! true V
Do you think it
" I hardly know what to say about it ; there is some truth in most of the wildest stories which are told about particular spots and places, though they are often much exaggerated. It is very possible that a bishop's horse might have safely carried his master from the high down to the level ground below; but if he did do so, all that I can say is,it is not very probable that he went down the steep part by the wishing-well."

" I entertained my landlord with an account of a desperate adventure in which I once engaged at night, to take into custody a party of gipsy robbers, so that we passed the time very pleasantly till we
came to St. Boniface Down."
" Will you tell us of that adventure of the gipsy
robbers, uncle ?"
" Not now, not now! let me go on with my
story. We went down the side of St. Boniface Down very cautiously, for the place is fearfully steep, and one false step might have precipitated us five or six hundred feet headlong. At last, after descending about a third part of the precipitous
highdown,wecametothespot; butafallofloose chalk had completely filled up the well, so that had it not been for the rushes which grew there, no one would have suspected that water had ever issued from the place."
" Then it was of no use your wishing anything, uncle."
" None at all, none at all ; and if there had been water there, it would have made no difference on that head ; but I thought of what my landlady had told me about wishing herself safe down again, and it appeared to me to be a very natural wish."

" Was it so very dangerous ?"
" Dangerous ! I did my best to look calm and collected ; but I found it very necessary to steady myself with my stick, and to use all my caution, while my landlord related to me some of the popu- lar tales about the high downs and cliffs."
" Did he tell you those tales while you were standing in that dangerous spot ?"
" He did. He said there was a strip of land at the bottom of the high down that no one could ever build upon ; and the tale commonly told about it was this : —-Once upon a time a certain bishop, on horseback, whether it was bishop Boniface or not, he did not say, was benighted on the high down. Not knowing what to do, he threw the reins on the neck of his horse, that he might take his own course. The horse directly began to descend the precipitous steep."
" What! down the steep side of St. Boniface?"
" Yes ; the poor animal picked his way, as well as he could, while the bishop kept praying all the way, as he had good reason to do, that his life might be preserved. In his jeopardy he made a vow, that if ever he again set foot on level ground he would buy the place that he first trod on, for pious purposes. The horse carried his master

safely down the hill, the bishop kept his vow in purchasing the land, and it goes by the name of Bishop's Acre to this day."
" Well, that is a curious tale ! true V
Do you think it
" I hardly know what to say about it ; there is some truth in most of the wildest stories which are told about particular spots and places, though they are often much exaggerated. It is very possible that a bishop's horse might have safely carried his master from the high down to the level ground below; but if he did do so, all that I can say is, it is not very probable that he went down the steep part by the wishing-well."
" What tales were told you about the high cliffs, uncle ?"
" Several, that I have reason to believe were true. My landlord said that, some years ago, two soldiers who were intoxicated, lost their way by night and became confused. They approached the perpen- dicular cliffs that are seen as you pass between the
St. Lawrence and Niton, and over they they went. I dare say the cliffs are more than five hundred feet high ; it was a terrible fall, and both of them were killed. There are accidents enough in the world
without intemperance adding to their number."

" Poor soldiers ! very likely they were brave
fellows, with all their faults."
" They might be so. I like bravery, but I had
much rather see it employed in saving life, than in destroying it. I met with some lines yesterday that much pleased me. They were scrawled by a prisoner on his dungeon walls, and if he really
were a Christian and a patriot, they do him credit they were as follows :
I boast no courage on the battle field,
Where hostile troops iinmix in horrid fray
For love or fame I can no weapon wield, With burning lust an enemy to slay.
But test my spirit at the blazing stake, For advocacy of the rights of man
And truth—or on the wheel my body break Let persecution place me 'neath its ban Insult, defame, proscribe my humble name
Yea—put the dagger at my naked breast If I recoil in terror from the flame
Or recreant prove when peril rears its crest,
To save a limb, or shun the public scorn
Then write me down for aye—weakest of woman born.'
" He must indeed have been a bold man !"
" My landlord told me, also, of a man who fell over the cliffs, with some water cans, and though badly hurt, he was able afterwards to follow his
calling. But another accident of which he told me was very remarkable."
" Let us have it, uncle !" ! let us have it

 “ THE BISHOP’S ACRE ”
around which such a halo of mystery has grown, must now be con- sidered. This plot of ground at the foot of the Down stands on the north side of St. Boniface Road, just outside the parish boundaries, and before Ventnor, in 1867, was constituted a separate Urban Authority, formed a part of the Newchurch parish.
Several interesting stories have arisen in connection with it. The earliest I can find is the following :
” There are few places of antiquity but wj||^t have some extraordinary stories told of them. Among those circulate in this neighbourhood is the following A gentleman mistaking his road during a heavy snow, and descending, in consequence of it, the steep down of St. Boniface, on horseback, he was so affected by the danger he was in, that he vowed if ever he reached the bottom of the hill in safety, he would, as a memento of the kindness of Providence, purchase the land, and present it toihe church of Shanklin.”
Albin, five years later, repeats this version, and further says that :
"It needs only to be added that a small parcel of land, containing about an acre, was given to the living in this situation, and, as supposed, in consequence of that vow.”2

1 Hassell, Tour to /. JV,, vol. ii, pp. x-a. 3 Albin, ffist. of I, p. 494

The story, as related by Adams, varies the particulars :
“ Good St. Boniface, during a very stormy night, having missed his path, found himself descending this steep,—not a very pleasant expedition on horse* back,—and thereupon vowed that if he reached the bottom in safety, he would purchase the land where he alighted, and endow with it the Church of Shanklin. He did descend in safety, and he piously kept his vow ; —the land is known in remembrance thereof as the "Bishop’s Acre." ** l
The tradition, as related by Canon Venables is :
**
That a certain bishop who, riding over the Downs, lost his way in a thick mist, and to his horror found himself on the brink of the precipitous face
Canon Venables says, in alluding to the legend, ” that the story does account, in a manner not altogether incredible, for the singular fact that this little rectangular plot lying by itself in the midst of other pro- perty, and not even in the parish of Bonchurch, has belonged to the Rector from time immemorial.” As the ” old sea captain ” says in his
Wanderings in the Isle of Wight, ” it is a curious tale, but as to the truth of it—that is quite another story.”
In the Appendix to Worsley’s History a charter of Walter de Insula is given, g?anting land on the side of St. Boniface, next to Luccombe, to the monks of Quarr Abbey. The charter is couched in the following terms :
” Sciant praesentes et futuri quod ego Walterus de Insula, assensu et voluntate Galfridi filii et haeredis mei, dedi et concessi Deo et beatae Marie de Quarraria et monachis ibidem Deo servientibus terram cultibilem lateris mentis sancti Bonifacii qui est versus Luvecumbam,” etc.3
Mr. Percy Stone gives the purport of the charter clearly : —” A feoff- ment in fee of Land made to the monks of Quarrer according to bound- ariessetbycommonassentoftheParties. GiftbyWalterdeInsula,with the consent of his son Geoffery, of the side of St. Boniface down next Luccombe : testibus*Will. filio Stur, Will Avenel. Seal, a knight riding at speed in his right hand the bridle, in his left extended a hawk.”^ The date of the charter is not given, and though assigned to the time of Henry III, is probably of an earlier date, towards the close of King John’s reign. Walter de Insula died in 1221; the son, Geoffrey, was probably of full age when he assented to the grant, and therefore born by or before 1201.
The gift could not have been to the church of Shanklin, since that church was not founded till a later period—after 1305 and before 1333. The edifice is not mentioned in the Dean’s return of the Island churches, but is referred to in Bishop Stratford’s register, 1323--33, and is then in the presentation of John de Insula, the probable founder of the church

and the patron of the Bonchurch tiving. Shankiin was a chapelry—^not having the right of burial or of administering the sacraments, and the residents had to resort to Brading in order to bury their dead. The Bishop could not have been St. Boniface, who lived several centuries earlier. When the temporalities belonging to Quarr Abbey were dis- persed, there is no deed to show how this parcel of land became attached to the Bonchurch living. It was not unusual however, where monas- teries had been previously established, to transfer the tithes, glebe, etc., to a church of later foundation in the locality from whence the offerings were derived, the consent of the Bishop having first been obtained.
Mr. F. J. Hughes, the present owner of 5, 6. 7, and 8, St. Boniface Terrace, rents part of the glebe land known as “ Bishop’s Acre ” on lease, renewable every twenty-one years, from the Ecclesiastical Com- missioners acid the Rector of Bonchurch, at an annual rental of £12, The land thus leased is included in and forms part of the garden ground attached to the houses.
^‘ST. BONIFACE WISHING WELL.”
There is another feature connected w'ith the early history of Ventnor which ought to be noticed. The “Wishing Well,” or “Holywell Spring,” as it is called by Worsley, is situated on the steep face of the down, not far from its summit, and although, in these later days, it has fallen from its high estate, and its claims are barely recognised, has still several interesting points connected . with it which call for notice. Its antiquity is undoubted, and if the past history could be traced we should have to go back many centuries to a period when well-worship was in vogue. This of itself should excite the interest and enlist the sympathies of all who visit the spot. Reverence, or in other words, well- worship, can be traced from the most remote antiquity all the world over. It appears to have been common alike to the Pagan Celts and to the Saxon Christians. It was found difficult to put down this worship, and many edicts of the Church were directed against it, from the 5th to the nth centuries. What could not be suppressed would appear to have been at last sanctioned under the patronage of the Saints; hence we have St. Boniface Well, St. Lawrence Well and Holiwell, Niton, in the neighbourhood, as examples of such holy wells.
“I think there can be little doubt,” writes Mr. T. W. Shore, “ that the ‘ Wishing Wells ’ are survivals^! the medieval holy wells. In Hampshire and the Isle of Wight we have a considerable number of wells and springs which had a sanctity in previous centuries, and which have, or had, a ‘ Folk Lore ’ of their own down to the last century. First, in point of interest, amon^ these is St. Boniface Well, at Bon- church.”!
The earliest reference to the Well is found in the pages of Tomkins’ Tour to the Island, showing that the sanctity of the well and its claims
: were duly recognised —“
Just above the house (St. Boniface House) is 1 Shore, Memorial VoL, p. 99 (H. F. C).

a spring, which was formerly held in high veneration by the seamen. It was their custom, in passing this place, to lower the fore-topmast in reverence to St. Boniface. A further notice occurs in the pages of Englefield : —“ Near to the top of the slope, and in the steepest part of it, is a small spring, famous by the name of St. Boniface’s Well, and regarded by the people with a sort of religious veneration,” adding later : —“ I climbed up the steep side, by the path which leads to the celebrated Well of St. Boniface, which, however, was at that time a very inconsiderable spring. A spring at this height is a most remarkable circumstance, and the only instance of the kind in the whole range of chalk downs. It indicates some stratum within the hill differing from the chalk, which would certainly let the rain water sink through its substance here, as it does everywhere else. ”2 The late Canon Venables
: says —
“ The remarkable fact of a spring bursting forth at so great an elevation is alike interesting to the geologist and to the lover of old superstitions, from the reverence which it is said, was formerly shown to it. The popular belief was, that if the well were reached without once looking back, any wish formed while drinking the water would certainly be granted, and the story goes that the lads and lasses of the neigh- bourhood used to resort to the well on St. Boniface Day to deck it with garlands of flowers.”3 This custom, I need hardly say, no longer exists among the merrymakings of the district, but is buried in oblivion, with many other partially religious observances of the olden times in “ Merrie England.”

1884 Isle of Wight Davenport

Several stone coffins have,at different times,been excavated at Quarr;afewcoinsandsomeotherrelicshavealsobeendiscovered,but not of a nature or in such abundance as to satisfy the antiquary, or throw any vivid light upon the history of the abbey. In 1857 a curious discovery was made by some labourers engaged in the con structionof a new road through the old abbey grounds,of “three small stone boxes or chests, each chest being about two feet in length and one foot wide. They were placed side by side,—two of them nearly close together, and the third a foot or two to the south. Upon removing the heavy stones of which the lids were composed, three human skeletons in a good state of preservation were found.

ENVIRONS OF RYDE. 163

The leg and arm bones were on either side, the ribs and small bones
in the centre, and the skulls at the western end, the latter being in all
three cases turned upside down. It was evident that these remains
had been removed at some time or other from the place of their
original burial ; and that they were of persons of distinction was
beyond doubt, or such care would not have been bestowed upon
them”(Isleof WightObserver). One of the skeletons was pronounced
to be that of an aged man,another that of an aged female,and the third that of "a tall fine man about forty years of age." It has been
suggested, and there is an air of probability about the suggestion, that they were the remains of Count Baldwin, his wife, and his son Henry. They are now in the Museum at Ryde.

This is just the spot where “the violet of a legend " might be ex pected to blossom ; and the traditions connected with the abbey are of a fantastic character. One tells of a deep subterraneous passage, closed by a golden gate, and is evidently the offspring of the awe and wonder created in the minds of the vulgar by monastic wealth and power. Another is not less wildly fabulous:—“At a short distance south of the ruins of the abbey is a wood, formerly thickly timbered, but now only consisting of a few decayed oaks and brushwood ; itis
called Eleanor's Grove,from a tradition that Eleanor of Guienne, queen of Henry II., was imprisoned at Quarr,and frequented this secluded spot, where, after death, it is related, she was interred in a golden coffin,which is supposed still to be protected from sacrilegious cupidity by magical spells.” About half a century ago a search was made for this golden coffin,with theresultof discovering one of common character, containing a female skeleton .

At Chale still lingers a relic of a curious feature of life in th eMiddleAges, On St. Catherine's Down, 769 feet above the sea, there is undoubted evidence showing that in the fourteenth century a hermit had taken up his residence on the summit. A hermit was a religious personage who, without becoming a member of a monastic community, kept aloof from society. The hermit was a solitary in a cell, as distin-

guished from an anchorite, who was a solitary without any
fixed dwelling-f)lace. There is record in the registers of llie

same register that a chapel was erected on the spot by Walter
de Godyton, who added an endowment for a chantry priest
to sing masses for the soul of the founder and the souls of
his ancestors, as also to provide lights at night to warn off
ships from approaching too near this dangerous coast. The
abode of this chantry-priest was nothing more than a half-
timbered hut, containing two rooms, with no fireplace beyond
a space of ground on which he burnt some dried turf, and
with no chimney except a hole in the roof. At the Reforma-
tion, when some of the wheat was pulled up with the tares by
the rude and ruthless hands of those who took part in that
purifying but destructive process, the lights in this humble
hermitage were put out, when the masses were forbidden.
The chapel and the hermitage have entirely disappeared, but in 1753 their foundations were excavated by Sir Richard
Worsley, and are. Canon Venables says, still to be traced.
Worsley {Hisi. I. W. p. 247) has a note which states that '
in the family papers is a small rude drawing of this chapel, when entire, from which it appears that it had only a body without a transept; the tower stood at the west end. A description of this tower, with four views of it in its de- cayed state, is seen in the Gentleman's Magazine, vol. xxvii. p. 176.
With the destruction of the chantry, the morals of the
people of Chale, as regarded the treatment of shipwrecked mariners, became worse rather than better. Tomkins, in his
Tour in the Isle of Wight (London, i 796), vol. i. p. 1 26, having
described in his how,

'
island, they stood

out in the channel to avoid the lurking rocks which abound
'
in Chale Bay." adds, Here our sailors told us of an inhuman
stratagem said to have been practised on this coast for a number of years, but it has too much the air of fiction and
improbability to be seriously credited. On every stormy night the inhabitants of the coast of Chale are said to have allured the unwary mariner to his destruction by fixing

a lanthorn to the head of an old horse, one of whose fore-
legs had been previously lied up. The limping gait of the animal gave the lantliorn a kind of motion exactly similar to that of a ship's lanthorn, and led the deceived pilot on thefe fatal rocks, a prey to merciless plunderers, who it was said would not even scruple to dispatch any unfortunate individual that survived the wreck, in order to secure their booty more
completely.'
Dreadful traditions of such barbarous contrivances as that
mentioned by Tomkins still linger on other coasts besides that of the back of the Isle of Wight. The history of wrecking, as told by the different legislative enactments which have been passed to prevent this savage custom, is a dismal chapter in the records of human and ' Wreck,'

by
the ancient common
law,
was where
any ship
was lost at sea and the goods and cargo were thrown upon
the land, in which case these goods so wrecked were ad-
judged to belong to the king, for it was held that by the loss
of the ship all properly was gone out of the original owner.'
This revenue of wrecks was frequently granted out to lords
of manors as a royal franchise. The lords of the Isle of
Wight had this privilege, and thus in the 8th of Edward I
we read that when Isabella de Fortibus was called upon
before the Justices Itinerant to answer respecting the peculiar
extent and nature of her dominion in the island she was,
among other demands in the language of the Pleadings
' summoned to show to the lord the what warrant king by
she claimed to have wreck of the sea.' And so also, accord-
ing to Worsley {Hisl. I. W. p. 245), when Sir Thomas Langford leased out the manor of Chale, reservation was
made in this lease of wards, marriages, reliefs, escheats, wrecks of the sea, with the advowson of the church of Chale. In order to constitute a legal wreck, the goods must come to
the uncouth terms of 'jetsam,' flotsam,' and ligan.' Jetsam is where goods are cast into the sea, and there sink and remain under water ; flotsam is where they continue swim- ming on the surfiice of the waves ; ligan where they are sunk in the sea, but lied 10 a coik or buoy, in order to be found
land. If they continue at sea, the law distinguishes them by ''

 AND THE WRECKERS. l6l
ap:ain. These are also the Crown's if no owner appears to claim them ; but if any owner appears he is entitled to
recover the possession.
Henry I, whose declininfi; years were saddened by the loss
of his son, William of Normandy, and two of the king's
illegitimate children through shipwreck, a. d. 1120, was moved so far as to ordain that if any person escaped alive out of the
ship it should be no wreck. Henry II made a feeble
enlargement of this scant mercy, and by his charter declared
that if on the coasts of either England, Poitou, Oleron, or
Gascony, any ship should be distressed, and either man or
beast escape or be found therein alive, the goods should
remain to the owners if they claimed them within three
months, but otherwise should be esteemed a wreck and be-
long to the king, or other lord of the franchise. This was
again improved by Richard I, and the law as laid down by
Bracton in the reign of Henry III was a still further improve-
ment. In A. D. 1275, when at the Parliament held at
Westminster several reformatory statutes were issued, fur-
ther progress was made in the maritime law relating to
wrecks and wreckage. In a. d. 1257, when under Edward III,
who has been called the father of English commerce, the
staple was regulated by statute, and the five great commo-
dities of the kingdom were allowed to be dealt in for
exportation only by a corporation called the merchants of the staple and in certain specified towns where they were
disposed of to foreigners, it was also enacted that if any ship be lost on the shore and the goods come to land (which
cannot, says the statute, be called a wreck) they shall pre-
sently be delivered to the merchants, paying only a reasonable
reward to those that saved and preserved them, which shall '
becalled salvage.'
In spite of all this legislation the barbarous practice of
wrecking prevailed to the disgrace of the population on our sea-coasts. The fate of a vessel near in shore and driving
before a gale with people on board likely to perish ought to touch every human heart in one way only ; but in place of
creating a feeling of sympathy with the sufferers, it put the seafaring population on the Isle of Wight and elsewhere upon calculations of their own profit from the sad catastrophe.
VOL. I. M

 1 62 THE VILLAGE OF CHALE AND THE WRECKERS.
Often in remote times has an unfortunate crew been seduced to its fate upon the rocks in thick weather, and then not seldom have the master, the mate, and the sailors, too few and too feeble to fight for their lives, escaping from the breakers, been hurried to their end by the bludgeons of the wreckers. Dead men tell no tales and claim no property. Instances have occurred when some fearful old woman has been known to kneel upon the chest of a sailor who had been dragged upon the beach out of the way of the surf and covering his mouth with her cloak carry off his money which he wore about his person. Not only tradition has handed down these atrocities ; there is more trustworthy evidence that such things were done even towards the end of the last century. The preamble of an Act of Parliament is generally the sum- mary of the arguments for the necessity of the Bill. The preamble of a Bill for the repression of crime may therefore be taken as the expression of the national conviction that such crimes exist at the time. In —the reign of George II
'
a new Act was passed which recited That notwithstanding
the good and salutary laws now in being against plundering and destroying vessels in distress, and against taking away
shipwrecked, lost, and stranded goods, still many wicked enormities had been practised to the disgrace of the nation.' Therefore certain provisions were enacted to the effect that death was to be the punishment for hanging out false lights ; also for those who killed or prevented the escape of ship- wrecked persons ; also for stealing goods from a wreck, whether there be any living creature on board or not. Acts of Parliament in following years showed the impress of the more merciful spirit of legislation which began to prevail. The punishment of theft from a wreck was reduced to imprisonment, while penal servitude for life was made the penalty for a new development of crime, the wilfully scuttling or setting on fire or wrecking a ship for the purpose of defrauding insurance offices or owners.
Upon our coasts, even at the beginning of this century, this plea for plundering a wrecked vessel was put forward, that it was done only at the expense of the underwriters, who, it was urged, made enormous profits in their business by calculating on these chances and squaring their rales of

 THE CISTERCIAN ABBEY OF QCARR. 163
insurance accordingly. Such sophistical arguments come easily enough from the lips of those who saw no harm in smuggling, and thought it no sin to cheat the revenue.
The lifeboat movement has contributed greatly towards
bringing about an improvement in the tone of public opinion.
The flashing lights from the lifeboat stations tell of coming
rescue to the homeward-bound ship, which has come suddenly
to destruction on our dangerous coast, instead of luring it on
to be the prey of wreckers. The mission of the gallant
crews of the lifeboat is to save life, and their courage is glori-
fied by mercy. There are still, as of old, keen eyes watching
the signs of the coming storm, as they see in the dim dis-
tance the struggling ship making towards the land, but those
eyes are not lighted up with the greed of the vulture watching
lor its prey ; hardy resolute men are on the look-out, eagerly
watching the labouring vessel from the shore, and preparing
to launch the lifeboat, should the necessity arise. Let all
honour be paid to the branch of the Lifeboat Institution
which has been established in this Island, but do not let us
forget Walter de Godyton and his primitive lighthouse on
St. Catherine's Down, nor the solitary chantry priest kindling
the lamp, whose faint gleams were in old days blessed by the
anxious mariner. None of the excitement which stirs the
heart of the coxswain and his crew in the lifeboat was felt in
the bleak abode of that man of God; he had sacrificed every-
thing on earth which most of us hold dear ; a drearier life we
cannot conceive; let us not then grudge the due meed of
honour and of respect to this lonely watcher o'er the deep, as
night after night he lit his beacon, and bent his knee in prayer

those in danger of the sea.' February 5, 1887.
