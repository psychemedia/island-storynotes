A chantry was established

arts, who taught English grammar to
young children. But as this chantry was not
stated to have been a grammar school by foundation, it may be that teaching was only the
voluntary occupation of the chantry priest. However this may be, the chantry was founded
before the year 1548, and was partly re-endowed as a "Free Grammar School" before
1617, and 1622. It remained a real grammar school until 1813, since which date it has been concerned only with elementary education.

Godshill Church (6rf. each, towards the restoration), one of the six given by William Fitz Osbern soon after the Conquest, to his Abbey of Lyra in Normandy, and perhaps founded by him, was, according to tradition, originally built in the valley at Devil's Acre, Sheepwash, about a mile S.W. Perhaps the monks effected the change of site, attributed as usual to the devil, but of their work nothing is left. On the suppression of the Alien Priories in 1414, Henry V. gave Godshill to Sheen Priory, founded that year.

The Church, as we see it, dates from the first quarter of the 15th cent., and is, with the exception of later tasteless work, Early Perpendicular. Architecturally it is of little interest. The top stage of the tower was rebuilt in the 16th cent., and restored after being struck by lightning in 1778. The building consists of two equal aisles with short transepts—Sanctus Bell niche in S gable—and a Tower at the W. end of the N. Aisle or Nave. In the S. Porch is a tablet to Eichard Gard, whose virtues are chronicled, but not the oblique ways in which, according to Sir John Oglander, he acquired wealth. Notice the old door, and just within it a piscina. The latter is an insertion, but its left-hand side is Early English, and the sole relic of the church of the Lyra monks. The interior of the Church is fairly lined with memorials, chiefly to the Worsley family of Appuldurcombe. It may be noted that the E. and W. windows, which have apparently Decorated tracery, are really of Perpendicular date, and the arch next W. of the sacrarium is only an imitation of Early English work. On the N. wall is a copy of a picture by Eubens, "Daniel in the den of lions." The only monuments of interest are S. of the sacrarium. Sir John Leigh {temiJ. Henry VIII.) and his wife, with alabaster effigies. At his feet is the boar which killed him, and two monks as weepers. The lady {nee Hackett) whose first husband had been the last of the Fry family of Appuldur- combe, brought that property to Sir John, whose only child married Sir James Worsley, from Lincolnshire, who was Captain of Wight from 1511 to 1538.



Wight words skeet p58
The belief in supernatural influences at the erection of churches is of very early origin, and it appears to point to the period of transition from paganism to Christianity. That connected with Godshill church is, that when the materials for building were collected in a field below, they were removed, at night, to the elevated spot on which the church now stands. The field from which the building stones were removed is called the Devil's Acre.






Isle of Wight Venables
The church (of which the old tradition is told, so common elsewhere to explain the position of sacred edifices on elevated or otherwise inconvenient sites, of spirits, either good or evil, transporting the materials from the valley below during the night, until the builders were constrained to acquiesce in the change of situation) stands on an isolated knoll, whose broken sides, rich in colouring and profuse vegetation, offer many tempting studies to an artist
pp97
Godshill church was the scene, in the fourteenth century, of some of those unseemly disputes between the seculars and regulars then so common. Letters from two successive Bishops of Winchester A.D. 1307, 1340, are given in Worsley's History, complaining that the monks had taken violent possession of the church, and fortified themselves therein, holding it by force of arms against the bishop, and begging the king to interpose his authority in their behalf.
The church was struck by lightning in January 1778,
and considerably damaged. The lightning descended the tower, loosening the masonry; and entering the church, proceeded along the whole length of the wall above the arcade to Sir John Leigh's monument, where it dislodged a portion of the mouldings, and made itsway into the ground below the east windows. Soon after this the gable fell, and continued some little time in ruins.
A grammar school was founded here by Sir Richard Worsley, in 1614 ;but though former writers speak of it as in a state of efficiency, the endowment has proved entirely
inadequate, and the intentions of the founder have ceased
to take effect. The curate for the time being has been
for some time past the nominal master of the Grammar School, and the occupier of the premises built on the site of
the old "Chantry House."

1850 barbers picturesque guide
GODSHILL is a picturesque village, much remarked for
the bold position of its Church, which, standing on a very abrupt hill, surrounded by the cottages of the inhabitants,
may be supposed to have given name to the place, from its erection on so commanding a site. Rustic tradition, indeed, tells that a more lowly spot was at first selected; but that the materials employed for that purpose by day, being regularly removed, by invisible agents, to the summit of the hill during the night, the workmen at length wisely determined to save themselves further unnecessary trouble, and built the church where some supernatural authority so plainly intimated that it must be erected!



https://godshill.online/the-godshill-legend/
There have been a number of variations on the Godshill Legend. However, they all revolve around the same set of happenings over the space of a few days back in the seventh century when the largely Saxon inhabitants of the Isle of Wight were converted to the Christian faith.
The local inhabitants now needed a christian place of worship to attend. The only location at that time was the pagan site set on the top of the small hill where the church now stands. The village elders decided to build a chapel to God in a field below the site that had been used in pagan times.
It was a big community project and all the village helped to mark out the foundations on the chosen site. They built using small and large local stones gathered from wherever they could find them. At the end of the first day everyone was exhausted and went home to bed and they probably all slept very soundly.
When they returned to the building site early the following morning they discovered that everything in the field had disappeared. After a local search, they discovered everything, the stones, all of the markers and lines and all of their tools and ropes had been moved to the top of the hill. What's more, everything was laid out at the top of the hill exactly as had been left in the field below the previous evening.
So, the day's work was to be the moving of everything from the top of the hill back to the field below. So, after another day's exhausting work they were back to where they were the evening before. They thought no more of it and set off home for a good night's sleep.
You can imagine their astonishment the next morning when they found that exactly the same had happened again. Everything had been moved and laid out perfectly once more on top of the hill. They were determined the church should be in their chosen location at the bottom of the hill and again moved everything back and then continued the building work. At the end of the day, the village elders decided to post watchmen around the church to watch over the building works.
At midnight, in the dark, the watchmen started to hear rumbling sounds. They couldn't believe their eyes. They saw the giant stones sway from side to side slowly, as if awakening. The smaller stones then started jumping and rolling up the hill, leapfrogging over each other and the various obstacles in the way. The larger stones moved slowly, swaying and rolling. Not only the stones, but marker pegs, ropes, shovels and anything related to the building of the church, flew up the hill with them. At the top of the hill, marker pegs were hammered into the layout of the church with mallets that swung themselves, and string tied itself to the pegs to form the guide for the church building layout.
After the village elders had heard what had happened, they decreed that the church would be built on the top of the hill, and that from that time on, in honour of the miracle that had happened there, the village would be named "God's Hill". The field below the hill where they had initially tried to build their church was from then on known as "Devil's Acre".

Garle, Driving tour, p60-61
Passing through the interesting little village of Godshill, we stopped to visit the church, which is situated on the summit of a steep hill.
Tradition says the building operations were begun in the valley on a part known as the Devil's Acre, but during the night all the materials were mysteriously carried up to the top of the knoll, and those concerned, taking this for an intimation that the edifice was to be erected on the hill, built it there. In the entrance porch is a memorial tablet to a worthy, Richard Gard by name, who lived in the time of Sir John Oglander. This tablet sets forth his many virtues and generous acts; but Sir John, who knew him, describes him in his diary as a French refugee, shrewd and dishonest, and as having amassed considerable property by various base practices, such as by getting possession of title deeds of estates under colour of examining them, discovering some flaw, and then by base and fraudulent representations driving the parties to a com(osition advantageous to himself; also by stealing cattle and placing hot loaves on their horns to make them supple, and so render it easy to alter their natural shape, in order to deceive their lawful owner, should he come to claim them.
Sir John Oglander puts rather a different complexion on his deeds to that recorded on the tablet in the church porch. One curious clause in his will was that the stone placed over his grave should \^e broken to enable him to rise the easier on the Day of Judgment



Hassell vol 2 p87-89
Godshill
The architecture is partly Gothic, but, through the usual mode of modern beautification, the whole is not to be distinguished. However, when we viewed it, two of its gable ends had just fallen in, which broke the formal appearance of its extremity, and introduced a beautiful specimen of its ancient splendour. The ivy had twisted off many of its disagreeable angles, and added beauty to its Gothic appearance. Its present shattered state might have arisen
from its having been struck by lightning in the year 1778, when great damage was done to it. This church was anciently appropriated to the abbey of Lyra, in Normandy.

Upon our entering the porch [to the Church] we observed abstracts from several acts of parliament fixed against the door, and among them one that excited both our curiosity and risibility; - it was from an act made in the ſeventh of James the First, which enacts, that every female who unfortunately in trudes on the pariſh a second illegitimate child, shall be liable to imprisonment and hard labour in Bridewell for six months.

Now as the number of females on this iſland much exceeds that of the males; and as, from the mild temperature of the climate, circumſtances frequently ariſe among the lower ranks that render the intention of this act of no effect; we could not help thinking this public exhibition of the abstract as rather a rigorous exertion of Justice.

We found it was not very unuſual here for the young men, from the deficiency of numbers just ſpoken of, to pay their devoirs to more than one young woman at a time; and as it is not poſſible for him legally to unite himself to all of them, he generally beſtows his hand on her who had first presented him with a pledge of their love.

This, however, is seldom done till the approach of a second pledge from the same person renders such an act of compassion needful, in order to avoid the conſequences of the tremendous anathema fixed on the church door.

Worsley, History of the Isle of Wight, Appendix XLVII

In the Synod assembled at Oxford by Archbishop Langton, the thirteenth canon forbids the vicarage of any church to be given to a Vicar who shall not serve the church: the fourteenth obliges those who have benefices to reside: the fifteenth appoints a sufficient portion of the benefice to be allowed for the maintenance of the Vicar: and the fortieth forbids the letting to farm, excepting it be done for some cause, which hall be approved by the Bishop.


A neglect in the observation of these canons occasioned the Bishop to collate to those churches which fell to him by lapse: as fully appears by the register of William of Wykeham, who collated to the Vicarage of Carisbrook, void, as he expressly says, through neglect of the constitutions of Otho and Ottoboni.

There had been great commotions in the island on this occasion, and to what a height they rose at Godshill, are seen in Bishop Woodlock's Register, wherein the Monks, with their friends, are recorded to have held the church by force: the Bishop's letter to the King on that occasion, with another on a subsequent one, are inserted in the Appendix *. The Bishop also ordered the Dean of the island, to put the Clerk, collated by him, in possession of the church of Godshill, devolved to him, by virtue of the canon of the General Council.

http://www.strangehistory.net/2014/06/09/hallucinogenic-fairies/
There are fairy-dead counties in England, counties from which no or few fairy legends survive, particularly in the south-east. At the top of the league table is fairyless Kent, but not far behind is the Isle of Wight. To the best of my knowledge there is only one nineteenth century-legend (and nothing before) and that involved a close encounter with fairy dust. It is worth including here because it may – there is a slim chance – confirm the idea much loved of shaggy-haired anthropologists and neo-Murrayians that British 'shamans' (witches, fairy seers etc) used to imbibe magic mushrooms.
We are at Puckaster Cove on Wight a name that recalls, but that probably has nothing to do with, Puck. This particular account comes from a recent history of Wight Folklore and Legends by Joanne Thornton
The moon came out just then and [John] realized he was on the smooth area of Puckaster cove. He could hear tiny voices singing and on looking down towards his feet he saw several tiny people dancing in a ring. While he stood watching, one came up to him which looked like a child of about 5, the fairies began singing that this was Mr Puck. Mr Puck came up to John and climbed up his front holding onto his buttons; he came up to John's face and shoved some brown powder up John's nose. This made John sneeze and as he did so he shrank down to the fairy's size.
It is not clear where this brown powder originates: but might it be from the puffball that follows? Certainly, after an encounter with a rat, John ends up on a puffball.
Following this, which for John was a very scary encounter [the rat]; the fairies resumed dancing and mushrooms began to appear in the ring, with a puffball growing in the centre. John was asked to sit upon the puff ball, while the other fairies sat on the mushrooms forming a ring around John. He suddenly noticed that 2 butterfly like wings had grown out of his back, and that he could fly up into the air. This he tried, but decided to come back down and sit back on the puffball, as he was afraid of owls or other predators.
John was clearly a prudent man. However, if the connection with the puffball seem weak in this modern summary it should be noted that the puffball is repeated again and again in different versions of this tale. The puff ball is claimed to be John's seat assigned by Puck and is responsible for giving him wings. It also changes colour from white to brown, exploding, its spores making him again the normal size. In the earliest version known to me the powder is described as a kind of brown snuff. Puffballs do give out brown spores. Unfortunately for this theory puffballs do not seem to be hallucinogenic (having said that my source is a not always scientific site called shroomery). Any expert knowledge? drbeachcombing At yahoo DOT com
Fairies are always associated with toadstools and mushrooms: making or sitting on them. But this is the only instance I know anywhere of a fairy story including a fungus as a plot device.
27 June 2014: ANL, 'I remember coming across a clump of luminous toadstools in the middle of my parents' lawn when I was about ten or eleven years old. They looked rather like giant button mushrooms and were an orangey-brown colour in daylight. At night, however, they glowed a bright-green colour. I have never been able to identify the species. It looked quite magical, and I would not be surprised if some fairy lore was generated by such luminous phenomena rather than by the hallucinogenic qualities of some fungi.' Thanks ANL!
