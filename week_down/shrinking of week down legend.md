# The Shrinking of Week Down

A remarkable tale is is told of Week Down, between Whitwell and Ventnor, between St Catherine's and Shanklin, on the Isle of Wight.

In Sir Richard Worsley's [*The History of the Isle of Wight*](https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=wOZWAAAAcAAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false), of 1781, p247-8, a view from St Catherine's Down, where de Godeton's Pepperpot stands, is described:

> Looking eastward, from the elevated spot where the tower stands, two other hills are to be seen : the nearest, which is about three miles distant, is called Week down, over which, about a mile and a half farther, appears that called Shanklin down. Concerning these downs, a singular circumstance is remarked by the inhabitants of Chale, that may be mentioned for the gratification of those who are curious in natural enquiries, as the evidence of it seems unobjectionable. Shanklin down may now be guessed to stand about an hundred feet higher than the summit of Week down ; yet old persons still living affirm that within their remembrance, Shanklin down was barely visible from St. Catharine's : they declare moreover, that in their youth, old men have told them, they knew the time when Shanklin down could not be seen from Chale down, but only from the top of the Beacon ; the old post of which stands near the chapel. This testimony, if allowed, argues either a sinking of the intermediate down, or a rising of one of the other hills; the causes of which are left for philosophical investigation.

According to John Hassell, in the first part of his two volume [*Tour of the Isle of Wight*](https://archive.org/details/tourislewightdr00hassgoog/page/n290/mode/2up?q=chale), 1790, p192-3, it seems that the channge is even more pronounced than Richard Worsley suggested, even if he does not actually believe the legend:

> Stories are told by the inhabitants of the parish of Chale of the sinking of Week down, which lies about three miles off, in the intermediate way between St. Catherine's and Shanklin down. They say, that formerly Shanklin down, through the interference of Week down, could only be seen from St. Catherine's ; whereas now it is visible from Chale down; consequently either Week down must have sunk considerably, or Shanklin down must have increased its altitude. And some of the old people tell you that this has partly happened within their own own remembrance. So wonderful are the operations of Nature, that it is not for man to say , "It cannot be ;" but this is an event so far out of her usual course, that I own I could not readily give credit to it.

In passing, Hassell also describes the unused light house on top of St Catherine's down:

> On the top of St. Catherine's is a light house, and a beacon, neither of which are now used. The tower serves, in the day time, for an excellent landmark ; it being near eight hundred feet above the level of the sea at low water. A small part of the chapel is remaining ; it is in form an octagon, and by some called the hermitage, from - the circumstance of a priest's having formerly immured himself in it from the world.

He also relates, at pp207-8, a curious tale regarding the local atmospheric conditions out in the bay compared to the shoreline:

> hen we sat out from Knowle a storm seemed to be pending in the horizon ; and by the time we had reached St. Lawrence we heard several claps of thunder. As every incident which tended to produce picturesque effects instantly attracted our attention, we cast our eyes towards the sea, in order to observe whether any alteration had taken place on its smooth surface ; when, to our great surprise, we plainly perceived a vessel, within eight miles of the shore, labouring under the effects of the storm, and apparently in the greatest distress. And what was extremely striking was, that though the sea where the vessel happened to be, rolled (as it is commonly termed,) mountains high, yet not a breath of that air, which was there so tempestuous, ruffled the water on the beach beneath us.- An operation of Nature that had never before fallen under our inspection; and we greatly regretted not having with us some ingenious painter, in the marine line, to take an exact representation of it .

A few years later in [*The history of the Isle of Wight; military, ecclesiastical, civil, & natural*](https://archive.org/details/historyofisleofw00warniala/page/180/mode/2up), 1795, pp180-5, Richard Warner seems more believing of the legend, as well as being supportive of the idea that some of the downs are rising, rather than others sinking:

> A late amiable naturalist, speaking of a range of chalk downs, in the upper part of Hampshire, resembling those of the island, has the following observation : "perhaps I may be singular in my opinion, and not so happy as to convey to you the same idea; but I never contemplate these mountains, without thinking I perceive something analogous to *growth*, in their gentle swellings, and smooth fungus like protuberances, their fluted sides, and regular hollows and slopes, that carry at once the air of vegetative dilatation and expansion." `[White's Nat. Hist. Selborne, p. 163.]` The idea is novel and ingenious, and seems to be founded in truth, from certain appearances of gradual enlargement which the Isle of Wight hills have exhibited.

He describes the changing relationship between Week Down and Shanklin Down as follows:

> It is a well-known fact, that, about half a century since, Shanklin down, which (lands in the South-Eastern part of the island, was not to be discerned, from St. Catherine's, owing to the intervention of Week down, whose magnitude and elevation completely screened it from the eye. A gradual, but imperceptible expansion, however, of Shanklin down, has at length reared it to a greater bulk, and a greater height, (by at least one hundred feet) than that of its formerly invidious neighbour.

As to the sinking of Week Down, he favours a contrary explanation:

> It seems sufficiently clear, that this difference in the appearance of the two downs must have arisen rather from the growth of Shanklin, than the sinking of Week; since the latter, and all the surrounding downs, bear the same relative proportion to each other they ever did, which could not be the case, had any change taken place in its elevation or magnitude.

These downs exhibit a number of those circular marks on the grass, which Philosophy, unable herself to account satisfactorily
for the phenomenon, in compliance with vulgar superstition, is content to call by the name of *fairy rings*:

" Where At fall of eve the fairy people throng,  
In various game and revelry to pass  
The summer night, as village stories tell."

These appearances are generally circular, sometimes oval, and from two to twenty feet in diameter. They may easily be discovered by the rankness of the grafs, which forms the ring, and the number of fungi or mushrooms that cover it. Various, have been the conjectures relative to the cause of this phenomenon, and none perhaps more plausible than that of Doctor Darwin, who accounts for it in the following manner :

> "The numerous flames of lightning which occur every summer, are, I believe, generally discharged on the earth, and but seldom, if ever, from one cloud to another. Moist trees are the most frequent conductors of these flames of lightning, and I am informed by purchasers of wood, that innumerable trees are thus cracked and injured. At other times larger parts or prominences of clouds, gradually sinking as they move along, are discharged on the moister parts of grassy plains. Now this knob or corner of a
cloud, in being attracted by the earth, will become nearly cylindrical, as loose wool would do when drawn out into a thread, and will strike the earth with a stream of eleclricity perhaps two or ten yards in diameter. Now as a stream of electricity displaces the air it passes through, it is plain no part of the grass can be burnt by it, but just the external ring of this cylinder, where the grass can have access to the air, since without air nothing can be calcined. This earth, after having been so calcined, becomes a richer soil, and either fungusses or a bluer grass for many-years mark the place. That lightning displaces the air in its passage, is evinced by the loud crack that succeeds it, which is owing to the sides of the aerial vacuum clapping together when the lightning is withdrawn. That nothing will calcine without air is now well understood from the acids produced in the burning of phlogistic substances; and may be agreeably seen by suspending a paper on an iron prong, and putting it into the centre of the blaze of an iron furnace; it may be held there some feconds, and may be again withdrawn without being burnt, if it be passed quickly into the flame, and out again through the external part of it, which is in contact with the air. I know," adds the Doctor, " some circles of many yards diameter, of this kind, near Foremark in Derbyshire, which annually produce large white fungusses, and stronger grass, and have done so, I am informed, above thirty years." The probability of this hypothesis will perhaps be allowed, when it is recollected that these gramineous circles are generally found upon open and exposed places, and never in *immediate contact* with trees, or any other free conductors of the electrical fluid.

c|;ecj above thefe terrible precipices, in form of a chapel, dedicated to St. Catherine^ in 1323, by Walter lord of the manor of Godyton in this neighbourhood, who alTigned certain rents for a chaunting prieft to fing mafs, and also to provide light in the Tower for the safety of navigators. At the DhTolution, the prayers of the priest:, and the more efficacious security derived from the light-house, were involved in one common ruin. Neither of them were ever reftored ; yet the Tower, still called St. Catherine's Tower continues to serve as a guide to mariners by day. It was thought of such importance, of late years, that it has been thoroughly repaired, and, in clearing away the foundation of the chapel, the form was discovered, and the floor of the little cell of the pious priest laid open to view.
This chapel flood seven hundred and fifty feet above high-water-mark, and commanded a most extensive view ;
its outside was octangular, its inside square, the top pyramidal. In the two first respects it has the form of the famous Roman Pharos at Dover \ but, the finishing of the last being loft, we can pursue the comparison no further.
Divines, who seek for the completion of prophecies, may have a more comfortable and authentic proof, from the recent appearance of Shanklin Down, from the Tower of St Catherine. Within memory of man, another, called Week Down, interfered fo far as to render the former scarcely visible from the Tower; but, at present, Shanklin Down appears from that ancient structure a hundred feet higher than that of Week: so that, in this instance at least,
cc every valley shall
be exalted, and every mountain shall be made low." I well
remember the infinite satisfaction I gave to a truly learned
and pious Divine on this subject, by relating to him, that the
later measures of the height of our boafled Snowdon made
it about a hundred and fifty feet lower than it was in the
preceding century.
Being now on the centre of danger, from, the storms and
tides of this important coast, I shall, from the communication of my worthy friend Mr. Bull, give a history of the
lea, and the new attempts of the useful Trinity -house fee* teach the mariner to fhun thefe dire ftiorcs*.
" The high lands of St. Aldan s"' (fays my intelligent correfpondent) " in Dorsetshire, and St. Catherine s-point in the
il Isle of Wights form a great bay, and, in blowing weather,
<{ with the wind to the fouth-weft, hardly any veffel that
M gets within it efcapes without coming adioit. To preu vent this, the Trinity-house , a few years fince, erected, at
u the expence of 7000L two light-houses, one upon *S/. Catherine's-hill, and one upon the high downs just. above the
u Needle rocks, and a third upon Hurst beach ; the two laft
c were lighted for the first time the 29th of last September^
M but the former has never, yet been illuminated,. A toll
u or duty of one ihilling for every coasting vessel palling the " light is collected by the Trinity-house. British veffels, " bound on foreign voyages^ pay one halfpenny per ton ; " Foreigners, double. Sailors doubt whether the lights upon
s the two high points of the Needles, and St. Catherine's.,
will anfwer any good pnrpofe. They fay, they had been

c lights ; one fatal inftanceof which has already happened, " for, the night before we left the island, a Dutch frigate^
c of thirty-six guns and two hundred and fifty men, came
" bump ashore, (miftaking the lights,) and was beat to pieces ; " and though most of the crew were saved at lafl,.the furf " ran fo high, it was one night and two days before they

THE ISLE OF WIGHT. 535
At length I sat upright in bed to take a good look at them ; but the moment they observed me watching them, their forms faded gra- dually away, till at length they only appeared like thin mists waving about. When I laid my head down again, they appeared to be more at their ease, dipping, and splashing, and throwing the water about at one another. After amusing themselves in this manner for about an hour, one of them took hold of the hearth-broom, and sat herself astraddle on it ; the two others got on behind her, and they all three flew up the chimney together, broom and all. I could hear the thick end of the broom knocking against the sides of the chimney all the way up to the top, first on one side, and then on the other."
" Pray, sir, did not the fire burn blue all this time?" asked an old woman in a plaid cloak, who had been listening with breathless interest.
" Very blue," was the reply.
" When I went down to breakfast in the morning, I told my host that something very extraordinary had happened to me in the night, and I related to him all that I had seen."
" There is nothing at all extraordinary in that," was his reply. " If you leave your foot-tub in your room, the witches always do come and bathe in it. Nobody in the Highlands ever leaves a foot- tub that he has washed his feet in, in the room. I do not know that I can remember an instance of it of late years, except, indeed, one, and that was a man in. Inverness gaol, who was sentenced to solitary confinement — and he did it for society."
The story being concluded, its hero passed through his cluster of listeners, lounged up and down the deck, affecting a kind of aristo- cratic superiority. He felt conscious that his story had told well, and that he was for the moment the lion of the party ; he flattered himself that he had thrown both Mr. Winterblossom and Mr. Brown altogether into the shade. His triumph, however, was but short- lived ; for soon afterwards, as we were looking towards the island, I observed to the antiquary,
" That high peak that we see is St. Katherine's, the highest point of the island, is it not ? "
<e Yes," he replied, "St. Katherine's is at present the highest point of the island."
" Is at present ! Why, you do not mean to say that there ever was a time when its elevation was different ? "
" That I know nothing about," he replied ; " but it appears very probable that Shanklin Down will soon overtake it in height."
" Why, you don't mean to say that Shanklin Down is growing higher ? "
" That, indeed, appears to be the case, or, at any rate, relatively to other heights in the island. The inhabitants of Chale will tell vou that formerly Shanklin Down, from the interference of Week Down, could only be seen from the top of St. Katherine's, whereas it is now visible from Chale Down, which is much lower ; conse- quently, unless Week Down has sunk lower than it was, Shanklin Down must have risen considerably. Now, if Week Down is sink- ing, it is very probable that St. Katherine's is slipping down too ; so that, whether Shanklin Down is growing higher or not, it seems very probable that it will in the course of time overlook all the rest of the Isle of Wight."

" Very curious/' said the hero of the foot-tub, with a kind of supercilious air. "I suppose the two hills playing at see-saw. — Now we go up, up, up ; and now we go down, down, clown. Very cu- rious,—-very," picking his teeth incredulously between the two last words.
" There is no animal," thought I to myself, " so jealous of another of the same species as your regular story-teller."
