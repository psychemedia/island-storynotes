*A selection of Island related tales I currently tell, I can fit various combinations into a set.*

## Ten Minute or so Tales

- *Walter de Godeton and the Shipwrecked wine* — the legend of the Pepperpot
- *Micah Morey and James Dove* — a gruesome tale
- *A Legend of Godshill* — Abraham Elder's take on how the Church came to be on the hill...
- *Puckaster Cove Fairy Tale* (15 mins) — a fairy tale...
- *The Pied Piper of Newtown* — via Abraham Elder...
- *The Three Little Pigs* — originally collected from Arreton in the 1840s
- *The Tragic Case of Henry Card* — (a tale from the Ferryman pub in Lymington that parallels the tale of the death of Windsor Dudley Cecil Hamborough in *The Ardlamont Affair*)

## Slightly Longer

- *the loss of the Eurydice* — myth, sinking, aftermath
- *Newport in the 1850s* — vice, depravity, the Pittis libel case, and a tangential link to Charlotte Brontë

## In preparation (ready in the next few weeks (some of them), months (others of them))

- *When the Island went to war with France* — a tale of Edward Woodville
- *Odo's gold* — a tale from Carisbrooke Castle around the time of 1066, and all that...
- *Felo de se at Knighton Gorges* — a sort of ghost story
- *Lady Worsley's bottom...* — a scandalous tale of Sir Richard Worsley...
- something around the Bembridge harbour development, Sandown pier etc - building projects around the time of the Eurydice, and complementary to that tale.
- *The death of Windsor Dudley Cecil Hamborough, aka "The Ardlamont Affair"*
- *The Parkhurst apprentices* (also relates to Newport in the 1850s)

## Portsmouth / Solent Tales (slightly longer than 10, also in prep.)

- *The Spithead mutiny* — yes there was, in 1797...
- *The tale of David Tyrie* — a spy story, and a gruesome execution; this can also lead in to the next tale...
- *The sinking of the Royal George*.
