# Castle Library Internet Archive Collection

*Proposal to create a full text searchable, publicly accessible, listing of 18th and 19th c. books about the Isle of Wight, where possible using openly licensed and freely accessible resources and services published by the Internet Archive and Wikimedia Foundation.*

Within the Castle Museum Library Museum, there is a good good collection of 18th and 19th century works about the Island (tours, topographies, etc.) Digitised copies of many of these works are available in digitised form, free of license restrictions, via the Internet Archive.

The Internet Archive works are full text searchable, albeit with varying degrees of accuracy (in some cases, the quality of the text extracted when the works were originally scanned several years ago leaves much to be desired).

Making a digital collection of works held by the Castle Museum library would offer the following benefits:

- it would promote the existence of the collection and the works held;
- it would provide remote access to works equivalent to works held in the collection;
- it would make works available in the collection searchable.

The Library catalogue is currently shared with researchers on request, and in a cut-down form, using an Excel spreadsheet.

The following project describes seeks to improve ways in which the catalogue can be accessed and digitised copies of equivalent works to some of the works held in the Library made available.

## Step 1 — Enriching the Current Catalogue with Links to Equivalent Works in the Internet Archive

For each item in the Library catalogue, try to identify an equivalent work in the Internet Archive. This process can be automated, at least in part.

*For works not found in the Internet Archive, it may also be worth checking to see igf an equivalent work exists via Google Books, the Hathi trust, and other openly licenced online scanned book collections.*

## Step 2 — Book Public Lists

In the first instance, for 18th and 19th century (out of copyright) works about the Island, as identified by class mark, held in the Castle Museum Library.

The [*Open Library* project](https://openlibrary.org/), developed under the auspices of the Internet Archive*, can be used to provide a browseable view of books in one of two ways:

- an online __list__ of works, with links to equivalent works, where available, in the Internet Archive. *This can be done with an ordinary user account; the resulting list can be shared ([small partial example](https://openlibrary.org/people/psychemedia/lists/OL294450L/Isle_of_Wight_Travel_Guides)).*

- an online __collection__ of works [https://openlibrary.org/help/faq/collections]. This requires additional Open Library "librarian" permissions over and above a simple user account. A catalogue allows works to be displayed using a carousel.

*The data added to the Open Library about a work can be accessed programmatically and used in other web applications and web pages.*

## Step 3 — Full Text Search of Books in the Collection

Using the list of books created in step 2, construct a simple full text search engine that can search inside all the books in the collection that are available on the Internet Archive.

Provide a simple web interface for searchng inside the books in the collection.

## Step 4 — Image Collection

For the works in the collection that also exist in the Internet Archive, create a gallery of images (plates, figures, illustrations, etc.) linked back to the original work.

## Costs

For a fully costed project, costs are likely to include at least the following:

- extending catologue collection records, e.g. with cross-reference data into the Internet Archive;
- creating a full text-searchable collection (a) min. viable using text from Internet Archive and related projects; b) improved OCR text extraction; c) human verified / improved texts;
- creating minimum viable public access tools to digital versions / equivalents of Castle Library holdings using Internet Archive and Wikimedia Foundation resources and services;
- developing and hosting improved public access tools to digital versions / equivalents of Castle Library holdings.

*Early stage proof-of-concept is the sort of thing I have tended to do in my spare time. For example, around the lockdown times, I explored search tools around fairy tale collections and Notes and Queries (the latter using resources from the Internet Archive https://psychemedia.github.io/storynotes/preface.html*
