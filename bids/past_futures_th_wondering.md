# Past Futures

Uncovering heritage on the Isle of Wight.

Stories exist:

- in peoples' heads
- in documentary sources (books, pamplets, newspaper articles)

Stories can be triggered:

- by places
- by artefacts
- by trades
- by stories
- in conversation
- etc.

## Documentary sources

*Focussing on documentary sources more than 100 years old: out ot copyright; no-one still living to retell the tales first hand.*

One aim of the project is to expose "hidden heritage". So what physical or digital collections exist that might act as a source of hidden, in the sense of *forgotten*, local stories?

- book collections (e.g. Castle Museum has a large collection of 19th c. guides to the Isle of Wight; many of this include descriptions of "things that were commonly known" about local places, annual events, etc. ("lost" or forgotten commonplace knowledge from 100+ years ago)); digitised copies many of the works in e.g. the Castle Museum are available to read online via the Internaet Archive, Google Books, etc.

- newspaper archives: the IWCP and Island Observer regularly publish "historical news" columns, demonstrating an interest (and cheap source of copy) in old news. The British Newspaper Archive ([BNA](https://britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/)) includes local and regional newspapers that span the 19th c. News stories identify: events, places, people, and also often reveal (or, intriguingly, suggest but do not describe...) commonplace knowledge.

*(There are also other possible collections which may be in or out of scope, e.g. pictures, photographs, postcards (front and back...); traditional songs and tunes.)*

__Contribution__: make an index available of historical books about the Island, ideally with brief summaries. For example, using OpenLIbriary lists [ https://openlibrary.org/people/psychemedia/lists/OL294450L/Isle_of_Wight_Travel_Guides ]

__Contribution__: links to / transcripts of interesting historical newspaper articles (BNA is searchable but the text transripts are often corrupted, which also hinders searsearch indexingach)

The above contributions can provide a starting point for story discovery / research, as well as identifying stories than can act as triggers for learning more about those stories. They surface resources that already exist and make them more visible, more accessible, more usable.

*Why is this important? There are collections available but who knows about them, or what they contain?*

## Community discovery and contribution

Community contributions might include, but are not limited to:

- providing *additional* or missing detail regarding a particular tale/place/person/event etc;
- providing *alternative* tellings;
- providing context;
- "that reminds me of ..."

Community contributions might include:

- stories;
- resources (books, pamphlets, ephemera, objects, photographs/postcards/drawings/pictures, places)

The community process can by triggered by / supported using prompts of stories identified in documentary collections, backed up by / further triggered by research from documentary collections, etc.

*I don't have a clear idea about who or what this "community" or "communities"  is or are, how it/they might be identified, approached, recruited? For a specific location, I imagine it might include regular walkers, dog-walkers, etc., as well as occasional, one-off visitors, etc. Related interested might be generated from offering "work in progress" talks to local history societies, interest groups, etc? Chatting to folk in cafes, pubs, etc.?*

## Trades

Some things change, some things don't. What glimpses are there of the past that can be triggered by, or continue in some form, in craft based trades, and what tales exist in the records that can be retriggered by living examples today:

- book-binding
- clock-making / repair
- wood-working
- blacksmithing
- harness making etc.
- globe making

__Contribution__: listing / directory of folk on the Island engaged in traditional crafts. *For Island Storytellers et al., this can help us plug into a living resource of folk we can talk to about traditional craft practice, related tales, etc.*

Approching craftworkers as community members has the advantage that, if they are trading, they are discoverable and identifiable.

*Why is this important? What did we lose when the Island lost Kevin Garlick, traditional shoemaker last year, along with his craft-related knowledge and tales?*

*Island farming recollections were collected in recent years as part of the [Farming Memories project](https://farmingmemories.com/).*

Trade / craft workers are knoweldgeable in tools, practice, apprentice-based transmission of skill and knowledge.

## Story realisation

Having identified, developed and articulated stories:

- they can be retold / remembered (oral transmission; e.g. amongst, by and from the community engaged in the community process);
- they can be added to the repertoire of, and performed by, Island storytellers (site specific events; final capstone performance; traditional fayre);
- they can described in written form (small published print book, online story archive);
- they can be captured, e.g. as an audio recording of a telling, video recording of an informal telling, performance, etc.
- they can be illustrated or act as a provocation for a visual reprepresentation.

## Somewhen Festival, Take 2

Building on ideas and reflections arising from the original Somewhen Festival, use the project as an input into a "Somewhen Traditional Fayre" â€” stories, music and crafts with an Island focus, celebrating things about the Island once commonly known...
