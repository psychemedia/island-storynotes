Memoirs of a smuggler: Compiled from His Diary and Journal

Rudyard Kipling

A smuggler's song

If you wake at midnight, and hear a horse's feet,
Don't go drawing back the blind, or looking in the street;
Them that ask no questions isn't told a lie.
Watch the wall, my darling, while the Gentlemen go by!

Five and twenty ponies,
Trotting through the dark —
Brandy for the Parson,
Baccy for the Clerk;
Laces for a lady, letters for a spy,
And watch the wall, my darling,
While the Gentlemen go by!

Running round the woodlump if you chance to find
Little barrels, roped and tarred, all full of brandy-wine,
Don't you shout to come and look, nor use 'em for your play.
Put the brishwood back again — and they'll be gone next day!

If you see the stable-door setting open wide;
If you see a tired horse lying down inside;
If your mother mends a coat cut about and tore;
If the lining's wet and warm — don't you ask no more!

If you meet King George's men, dressed in blue and red,
You be careful what you say, and mindful what is said.
If they call you "pretty maid," and chuck you 'neath the chin,
Don't you tell where no one is, nor yet where no one's been!

Knocks and footsteps round the house — whistles after dark —
You've no call for running out till the house-dogs bark.
Trusty's here, and Pincher's here, and see how dumb they lie —
They don't fret to follow when the Gentlemen go by!

If you do as you've been told, 'likely there's a chance,
You'll be given a dainty doll, all the way from France,
With a cap of Valenciennes, and a velvet hood —
A present from the Gentlemen, along o' being good!

Five and twenty ponies,
Trotting through the dark —
Brandy for the Parson,
'Baccy for the Clerk;
Them that asks no questions isn't told a lie —
Watch the wall, my darling,
While the Gentlemen go by!

The Listeners
BY WALTER DE LA MARE
'Is there anybody there?' said the Traveller,
Knocking on the moonlit door;
And his horse in the silence champed the grasses
Of the forest's ferny floor:
And a bird flew up out of the turret,
Above the Traveller's head:
And he smote upon the door again a second time;
'Is there anybody there?' he said.
But no one descended to the Traveller;
No head from the leaf-fringed sill
Leaned over and looked into his grey eyes,
Where he stood perplexed and still.
But only a host of phantom listeners
That dwelt in the lone house then
stood listening in the quiet of the moonlight
To that voice from the world of men:
stood thronging the faint moonbeams on the dark stair,
That goes down to the empty hall,
Hearkening in an air stirred and shaken
By the lonely Traveller's call.
And he felt in his heart their strangeness,
Their stillness answering his cry,
While his horse moved, cropping the dark turf,
'Neath the starred and leafy sky;
For he suddenly smote on the door, even
Louder, and lifted his head:—
'Tell them I came, and no one answered,
That I kept my word,' he said.
Never the least stir made the listeners,
Though every word he spake
Fell echoing through the shadowiness of the still house
From the one man left awake:
Ay, they heard his foot upon the stirrup,
And the sound of iron on stone,
And how the silence surged softly backward,
When the plunging hoofs were gone.

You may have heard the phrase "flotsam and jetsam" to describe various bits and bobs you might find floating in the sea?

Commentaries on the laws of England: in four books, Volume 1 
by sir William Blackstone

Publication date 1807

p.292-4

It is to be observed, that, in order to constitute a legal *wreck*, the goods must come to land. If they continue at sea, the law distinguishes them by the barbarous and uncouth appelations of *jetsam*, *flotsam* and *ligan*. Jetsam is where goods are cast into the sea, and there sink and remain under water: flotsam is where they continue swimming on the surface of the waves: ligan is where they are sunk in the sea, but tied to a cork or buoy, in order to be found again. These are also the king's, if no owner appears to claim them; but if any owner appears he is entitled to recover the possession. For even if they be cast overboard, without any mark or buoy, in order to lighten the ship, the owner is not by this act of necessity construed to have renounced his property: much less can things ligan be supposed to be abandoned, since the owner has done all in his power to assert and retain his property. These three are therefore accounted so far a distinct thing from the former, that by the king's grant to a man of wrecks, things jetsam, flotsam, and ligan will not pass.

Wrecks in their legal acceptation, are at present not very frequent: for, if any goods come to land, it rarely happens, since the improvement of commerce, navigation, and correspondence, that the owner is not able to assert his property within the year and day limited by law. And in order to preserve this property entire for him and if possible to prevent wrecks at all, our laws have made many very humane regulations; in a spirit quite opposite to those savage laws, which formerly prevailed in all the northern regions of Europe, and a few years ago were still said to subsist on the coasts of the Baltic sea, permitting the inhabitants to seize on whatever they could get as lawful prize: or, as an author of their own expresses it, *in naufragorum miseria et calamitate tanquam vultures ad praedam currere* ["in the wave of misery and disaster, run after their prey like vultures"]. For by the statute 27 Edw. III. c. 13. if any ship be lost on the shore, and the goods come to land, (which cannot, says the statute, be called wreck,) they shall be presently delivered to the merchants, paying only a reasonable reward to those that saved  and preserved them, which is entitled *salvage*. Also by the common law, if any persons (other than the sheriff) take any goods so cast on shore, which are not legal wreck, the owners might have a commission to inquire and find them out, and compel them to make restitution. And by statute 12 Ann. st. 2. c. 18. confirmed by 4 Geo. I. c. 12. in order to assist the distressed, and prevent the scandalous illegal practices on some of our sea coasts, (too similar to those on the Baltic,) it is enacted, that all head-officers and others of towns near the sea shall, upon application made to them, summon as many hands as are necessary, and send them to the relief of any ship in distress, on forfeiture of 100*l.* and, in case of assistance given, salvage shall be paid by the owners, to be assessed by three neighbouring justices. All persons that secrete any goods shall forfeit their treble value:  and if they wilfully do any act whereby the ship is lost or destroyed, by making holes in her, stealing her pumps, or otherwise, they are guilty of felony, without  benefit of clergy. Lastly, by the statute 26 Geo. II. c. 19, plundering any vessel either in distress, or wrecked, and whether any living creature be on board, or not, (for, whether wreck or otherwise, it is clearly not the property of the  populace,) such plundering, I say, or preventing the escape  of any person that endeavours to save his life, or wounding him with intent to destroy him, or putting out false lights in order to bring any vessel into danger, are all declared to be capital felonies; in like manner as the destroying of trees,  steeples, or other stated sea-marks, is punished by the statute 8 Eliz. c. 13. with a forfeiture of 100*l*. or outlawry. Moreover, by the statute of George II, pilfering any goods cast ashore is declared to be petty larceny; and many other salutary regulations are made for the more effectually preserving ships of any nation in distress.

[By the civil law, to destroy persons shipwrecked, or prevent their saving the ship, is capital. And to steal even a plank from a vessel in distress, or wrecked, makes the party liable to answer for the whole ship and cargo. The laws also of the Wisigoths, and the most early Neapolitan constitutions, punished with the utmost severity all those who neglected to assist any ship in distress, or plundered any goods cast on shore.]


https://www.gov.uk/guidance/wreck-and-salvage-law

According to section 255 of the Merchant shipping Act 1995, the definition of wreck includes "jetsam, flotsam, lagan and derelict found in or on the shores of the sea or any tidal water".

Jetsam describes goods cast overboard to lighten a vessel in danger of sinking. The vessel may still perish.

Flotsam describes goods lost from a ship which has sunk or otherwise perished.

Goods are recoverable because they remain afloat.Lagan describes goods cast overboard from a ship which afterwards perishes. The goods are buoyed so they can be recovered.


http://www.duhaime.org/LegalDictionary/F/Flotsam.aspx
William Blackstone, at paragraph 292 of his Commentaries on the Laws of England, Book I, wrote eloquently:
"... in order to constitute a legal wreck, the goods must come to land. If they continue at sea, the law distinguishes them by the barbarous and uncouth appellations of jetsam, flotsam and ligan.
"Jetsam is where goods are cast into the sea and there sink and remain under water.
"Flotsam is where they continue swimming on the surface of the waves.
"Ligan is where they are sunk in the sea, but tied to a cork or buoy in order to be found again."

https://www.beachcombingmagazine.com/blogs/news/flotsam-and-jetsam
sir William Blackstone (1723-1780) was an English lawyer, judge, and Tory politician who spent a good amount of time researching and studying jurisprudence and was most famous for writing Commentaries on the Laws of England, which was published in four volumes between 1765 and 1769. He penned these eloquent words about his country's maritime laws, "...in order to constitute a legal wreck, the goods must come to land. If they continue at sea, the law distinguishes them by the barbarous and uncouth appellations of jetsam, flotsam, and ligan."
Why is the difference important? Because under maritime law, salvaged items may or may not be claimed by the finder depending on whether they are flotsam or jetsam. And determining if debris is flotsam or jetsam rests solely on why it ended up in the water.

Flotsam, because it was unintentionally cast to the sea, may be claimed by its original owner, and not one who recovers it. Goods or items that float to the surface and eventually to the shore from a sunken vessel may be classified as flotsam. Generally, salvagers may keep the items they find if no one comes forward to lay claim to the found objects but they will have little legal claim to them if the original owners stake a claim. storied sunken treasure ships, when eventually found, usually make the news as court cases certainly follow. Once ownership is established (typically by the country that owned the ships hundreds of years ago), proving the wreckage was unintentional all but guarantees the flotsam will be returned to its original owner, and rarely to the person who found it.

Jetsam, because it was intentionally tossed into the water—usually thrown overboard to lighten the load when a ship was in distress—may sometimes be claimed by a lucky rescuer who discovers the discarded items. However, there have been instances where legal claims were successfully made by the jettisoning owner to retrieve their property.

"Flotsam" refers to goods that are floating on the surface of the water as the result of a wreck or an accident. As there is no clear way of defining ownership, one who discovers flotsam is allowed to claim it, unless someone claims ownership to the items in question.

Jetsam designates any cargo that is intentionally discarded from a ship or wreckage. Legally jetsam also floats, although floating is not part of the etymological meaning.[8] Generally, "jettisoning" connotes the action of throwing goods overboard to lighten the load of the ship if it is in danger of sinking.Per maritime law, one who discovers these artifacts is not required to return them to their rightful owner except in the case that the latter makes a legally abiding claim

If the items are washed ashore, however, then the laws of the land come into play.

Around the 1300s, the law of the sea, maritime law, was in its infancy. One of the earliest formulations was know as the *The Rolls of Oleron* (Rôles d´Oleron), named after the Île d'Oléron, an island due west of Rochefort, half way up the Atlantic coast of France, and which looks a little like a stretched Isle of Wight tipped on its side. Also known as the Judgments of the sea [ Jugemens de la mer], they were codified some time in the 1200s and to a large extent helped regulate the shipping of goods associated with the wine trade from Brittany and Normandy to England, scotland and Flanders, which is to say, the North European coastal areas around the Netherlands, Belgium and North Eastern France; by 1336, they had been included in the Black Book of the Admiralty and from then on were applied by Admiralty Courts, where necessary. But they would almost certainly have been know to seafarers twenty years before: as a maritime nation, coastal areas of England also lived as much by the law of the sea as the law of the land.

In the Rolls of Oleron, Article XXXII - oleron

If by reason of tempestuous weather, it be thought expedient, for the lightening of any ship or vessel at sea, or riding at anchor in any road, to cast part of the lading overboard, and it be done accordingly for the common safety, though the said goods so ejected, and cast over-board, do become his that can first possess himself thereof, and carry them away

Article XXXIII

If a ship, or any other vessel, hath cast overboard several goods or merchandises, which are in chests well locked and made fast; or books well clasped and shut close, that they may not be damnified by salt water; in such cases it is to be presumed, that they who did cast such goods overboard, do still retain an intention, hope, and desire of recovering the same: for which reason, such as shall happen to find such things, are obliged to make restitution thereof to him who shall make a due enquiry after them; or put them to pious uses, according to his conscience and the advice of some prudent neighbor.

Article XLIII

In all other things found by the sea side, which have formerly been in the possession of some one or other, as wines, oil, and other merchandize, although they have been cast overboard, and left by the merchants, and so ought to appertain to him that first finds the same; yet herein also the custom of the country is to be observed as well as in the case of fish. But if there be a presumption that these were the goods of some ship that perished, then neither the said lord, nor finder thereof, shall take any, to convert any part of it to their own use; but as has been said, distribute the money it produces amongst the poor and needy.

Article XXXIV

If any man happens to find any thing in the sea, or in the sand on the shore, in floods or in rivers, if it be precious stones, fishes, or any treasure of the sea, which never belonged to any man in point of property, it belongs to the first finder.

Article XXXVI

If any going along the sea-shore to fish, or otherwise, happens to find gold or silver, he shall be bound to make restitution thereof, deducting for his own pains; or if he be poor he may keep it to himself that is, if he knows not to whom to restore it; yet he shall give notice of the place where he found it, to the neighborhood and parts next adjacent, and advise with his superiors, who ought to weigh and take into consideration the property of the finder, and then to give him such advice as is consonant to good conscience. 

but from shipwrecks. And shipwrecks aplenty there were around that part of the coast.

According to chapter of IV of Edward I's statute of Westminster of 1275, *CONCERNING Wrecks of the sea), it was agreed "That where a Man, a Dog, or a Cat escape quick out of the ship, that such ship nor Barge, nor any thing within them, shall be adjudged Wreck"; any goods washing ashore from them would be held for a year and a day so that the owner could reclaim them.  
  
What greater temptation could there be for ensuring there were no survivors, and that any goods washing assure were from a wreck with no human, canine or feline survivors.

The Rolls of Oleron and the Admiralty Court in Fourteenth Century England Author(s): Timothy J. Runyan

common law couldn't cope with maritime disputes; court couldn't be heard at oleron; so Admiralty courts set up to administer law according to oleron
 The original version of the laws was probably drawn up in Anglo-Norman in about 1200
hat the Rolls are composed of judgments made by the court at Oleron in maritime disputes and that its decisions were based on custom familiar to most seamen. The Rolls of Oleron, then, are French in origin,12 associated with Aquitaine, and, as a quick reading will show, concern the Gascon wine trade in particular.'13 Because of the great volume of the wine trade between Gascony and England, carried mostly in English ships, the English mariners needed to be familiar with these practices. In fact, this necessity may have precipitated the codification of the laws in England. Their adoption was clear by the reign of Edward III when a Bristol inquest (1351) confirms that the Rolls have the status of law.14 We know also that the Rolls
were used in Castile, Brittany, Normandy, Flanders, and in the Baltic by or after this date

The Rolls of Oleron concern themselves with all aspects of a shipping venture. They are especially informative on the subject of the relationship of the members of the ship's party to one another and to merchants and owners as well. The master was appointed by the shipowner, and he engaged the mariners by a contractual agreement.16 Mariners were hired in one of three ways. They were paid a set wage for the journey, allowed to freight their own cargo in space allotted them (mareage)'7 or granted a share of the profits of the freight by the master. 8 Each of these contracts for payment entered into by the mariners ensures that they will be as interested as the master and merchants in the protection of maritime law for themselves and the cargo

The sailors generally made additional money by helping to load the ship for the merchant

It is evident from this discussion the English seas were not devoid of an extensive code for the regulation of life at sea. What is not revealed in a survey of the laws is the administrative machinery established to implement them.

The jurisdictional limits of the admiralty court were neither unchallenged nor as clearly defined as the above might suggest. There were several instances where the court's right to determine a case was challenged by the common law courts
These justices resented the growth of the admiralty court because they claimed it frequently indicted and tried persons without the use of a jury. Also, they questioned its power to hear all infractions of the law which occurred on water. since the seas do not uniformly cease once they reach land, but are contiguous with rivers and streams, the meaning of "at sea" or "on water" was rather nebulous. The admiralty generally expressed jurisdiction over inland waterways, but only to a point. It was never very clear exactly where that point was. It was for just such reasons that the common law courts objected to the ill-defined, but all too apparent, admiralty cou

We have seen that the admirals were determined to express their authority in a court of law as well as aboard ship, but it is unclear exactly when this court was established. The patent creating John Paveley admiral in 1360 empowered him to hear
pleas (querelae), and to do justice secundum legem maritimam.62

As we have noted, however, the vice-admiral and his court were functioning before this time. The evidence from a variety of cases indicates that the court originated between 1340 and 1357.6


Medieval Maritime Law from Oléron to Wisby: Jurisdictions in the Law of the sea
Edda Frankot Regulations regarding maritime law were recorded in compilations like the Rôles d'Oléron [Rolls of Oléron] and the so-called Wisby sea Law, which
in the past have been ascribed a wide-spread validity

The existence of various town laws including maritime regulations suggests, however, that the law of the sea was not shared between territories at all, but was divided across many small jurisdictions.

the fact remains that merchants and skippers involved in overseas trade did have special needs which were shared by all, for example with regard to gaining justice abroad. so how were these needs met?

s increase in carrying capacity of deep-sea vessels resulted in a separation of interests between the shipowners and the owners of the cargo. Merchants could now afford to buy off their duties aboard the ship and started to focus solely on trade
The clear division between shipowners, skipper, freighters and crew which was a result of the thirteenth-century developments, on the other hand, has continued until today.

A mention of the laws in a report written in the 12th year of Edward
III's reign (1329) confirms that the laws were in use in England in the first half of the 14th century1

In the later 15th century, some articles from Lübeck law were added to the text in two stages, resulting in the compilation which came to be known as the Gotland or Wisby sea Law.

The written maritime laws of Northern Europe can be divided into two groups: the
customary sea laws26 and the maritime regulations in the town laws.

The customary sea laws on the other hand had come into being as customs or rules of conduct agreed upon between different groups involved in sea shipping. They were meant to be valid in a large area, but in themselves lacked an authority to administer justice based on them: they could only become valid when a group of people accepted them as the law, as happened in Bruges and in some towns in the Netherlands, or when they were enforced by a (royal) authority, as was the case in France and England, The customary sea laws were private law restricted to the problems that arose during the journey and to those involved in sea trade, whereas urban maritime regulations also contained public law relating to the harbour and the law of wreck.

For a law to function there needs to be either an authority which can implement such a law from above or a community of people who swear an oath to abide by that law.

The question remains how the parties decided to which court to bring their case, especially when burghers from several different towns were involved. As mentioned above, the cases were dealt with by the home court of either one of the parties, by the court of the port of arrival or destination, which may have been different from the home towns of the involved parties, or, especially in cases of damage to ship and/or cargo, at the port nearest to where the accident had taken place n. Medieval maritime traders were, in general, first and foremost burghers of a town and as such subject to its jurisdiction. When encountering legal problems abroad,  ractical reasons dictated their decision as to where they would take their case to court. This would often mean that they had to seek justice from a foreign legal authority. However, having to deal with different customs and uses was inherent to medieval international trade, and merchants and skippers therefore probably did not think much of bringing their matters before the court of a foreign port where they had in general been granted equal rights to a fair trial as resident traders.

Digiest par 3 , book XIV, title II
(see also TItle 1: TITLE I. CONCERNING THE ACTION AGAINsT THE OWNER OF A sHIP. cf oleron rolls)
TITLE II. CONCERNING THE RHODIAN LAW OF JETTIsON.
1. Paulus, sentences, Book II.

It is provided by the Rhodian Law that where merchandise is thrown overboard for the purpose of lightening a ship, what has been lost for the benefit of all must be made up by the contribution of all.

2. The same, On the Edict, Book XXXIV.

When anything has been thrown overboard on account of the distress of a ship, the owners of the lost merchandise must sue the master of the ship on the contract for transportation, if they had entered into an agreement for the carriage of the same; and he can then bring suit against the others whose merchandise was saved, so that the loss may be distributed proportionally. servius, indeed, answered that they should proceed against the master of the ship under the contract for transportation to compel him to return the merchandise of the others, until they make good their share of the loss. Even though the master does retain the merchandise, he will, in any event, be entitled to an action under the contract for transportation against the passengers.

What is to be done if there are passengers who have no baggage? It evidently will be more convenient to retain their baggage, if there is any; but if there is not, and the party has leased the entire ship, an action can be brought on the contract, just as in the case of passengers who have rented places on a ship; for it is perfectly just that the loss should be partially borne by those who, by the destruction of the property of others, have secured the preservation of their own merchandise.

(1) If the merchandise is saved, and the ship is damaged, or has lost part of her equipment, no contribution should be made, for the condition of the things provided for the use of the ship is different from that on account of which the freight has been received; since, if a blacksmith breaks an anvil or a hammer, this will not be charged to him who hired him to do the work. Where, however, the loss occurred with the consent of the passengers, or on account of their fear, it must be made good.

(2) Where several merchants collect different kinds of goods in the same ship, and, in addition, many passengers, both slaves and freemen, are travelling in it, and a great storm arises, and part of the cargo is necessarily thrown overboard; the question was with respect to the following point, namely, whether it was necessary for all to make good what was thrown overboard; and whether this must also be done by those who had brought on board such merchandise as did not burden the ship; as, for instance, precious stones and pearls, and if this was the case, what portion of the same must be contributed; and whether it was necessary for anything to be paid for freemen, and by what kind of an action proceedings could be instituted? It was held that all those to whose interest it was that the goods should be thrown overboard must contribute, because they owed that contribution on account of the preservation of their property, and therefore even the owner of the ship was liable for his share. The amount of the loss must be distributed in proportion to the value of the property; no appraisement can be made of the persons of freemen; and the owners of the lost property have a right to proceed on the contract for transportation against the sailor, that is the master. An agreement also arose as to whether an estimate was to be made of the clothing and rings of each person, and it was held that this should be done, and that everything should be taken into account for contribution, except what had been brought on board for the purpose of consumption, in which would be included all kinds of provisions; and there is all the more reason in this, for if, at any time during the voyage, such articles should be lacking, each one would contribute what he possessed to the common stock.

(3) If the ship has been ransomed from pirates servius, Ofilius, and Labeo state that all should contribute; but with reference to what the robbers carried away, the loss must be borne by the party to whom it belonged, and no contribution should be made to him who ransomed his property.

(4) The share is generally contributed in accordance with the valuation of the property which is saved, and of that which is lost; and it makes no difference if that which was lost might have been sold for a higher price, since the contribution relates to loss and not to profit. With reference, however, to those things on account of which contribution must be made, the estimate should be based upon not what they had been purchased for, but upon what they could be sold for.

(5) No estimate should be made of slaves who are lost at sea, any more than where those who are ill die on the ship, or throw themselves overboard.

(6) If any of the passengers should be insolvent, the loss resulting from this will not be suffered by the master of the vessel; for a sailor is not obliged to inquire into the financial resources of everybody.

(7) Where property which has been thrown overboard is recovered, the necessity for contribution is at an end; but if it has already been made, then those who had paid can bring an action on the contract for transportation against the master, and he can proceed under the one for hiring, and return what he recovers.

(8) Any articles thrown overboard belong to the owner of the same, and do not become the property of him who obtains them, because they are not considered as abandoned.

3. Papinianus, Opinions, Book XIX.

Where a mast, or any other part of the equipment of a ship is thrown overboard for the purpose of removing a danger common to all, contribution is required.

4. Callistratus, Questions, Book II.

If, for the purpose of lightening an overloaded ship because she could not enter a river or reach a harbor with her cargo, a certain portion of the merchandise is placed in a boat to prevent the vessel from being in danger outside the river, or at the entrance of the harbor, or in the latter, and the boat is sunk, an account should be taken between those who have their merchandise preserved on the ship and those who lost theirs in the boat, just as if the latter had been thrown overboard. sabinus also adopts this view in the second Book of Opinions. On the other hand, if the boat is saved with part of the merchandise, and the ship is lost, no account should be taken with reference to those who lost their property in the ship, because jettison necessitates contribution only where the ship is saved.

(1) But where a ship, which has been lightened in a storm by throwing overboard the goods of a merchant, is sunk in some other place, and the goods of certain merchants are recovered by divers for compensation; sabinus also says an account must be taken between the party whose goods were thrown overboard during the voyage for the purpose of lightening the ship, and those who subsequently recovered their goods by means of divers. But, on the other hand, no account must be presented by the party whose merchandise was thrown overboard during the voyage to those whose merchandise was not thereby preserved, if any of it was recovered by divers; for it cannot be held to have been thrown overboard for the purpose of saving the ship which was lost.

(2) But where jetsam is made from the ship, and the merchandise of anyone which remained on board, is damaged; it is a matter for consideration whether he should be compelled to contribute, since he ought not to be oppressed by the double loss of contribution and deterioration of his property. The point, however, may be maintained that he should contribute in proportion to the present value of his property. Thus, for example, where the merchandise of two persons was each worth twenty aurei, and that of one of them became only worth ten, on account of having been wet; the party whose property was not damaged should contribute in the proportion of twenty and the other in the proportion of ten.

An opinion can, however, be given in this instance, if we make a distinction as to the cause of the deterioration; that is to say, whether the damage resulted on account of the exposure resulting from throwing the merchandise overboard, or for some other cause; for example, where the merchandise lay somewhere in a corner, and the waves reached it. In this instance the owner will be compelled to contribute, but in the former one, ought he not to be released from the burden of contribution because the jetsam also injured him? Or ought he to be liable even if his goods were deteriorated by the splashing of water on account of the jetsam?

A still finer distinction should be made, namely, as to whether the greater loss is sustained through the damage, or through the contribution; for example, if the merchandise is worth twenty aurei, and the contribution is assessed at ten, the damage, however, amounts to two, and this having been deducted because of the loss, must the owner contribute the remainder? How then if the damage amounted to more than the contribution? For example, if the property was damaged to the amount of ten aurei, and the contribution amounted to two, there is no doubt that the party should not bear both burdens. But here let us see whether a contribution should not be made to him; for what difference does it make whether I lose my property by its being thrown overboard, or have it deteriorated by being exposed? For just as relief is granted to a party for the loss of his property, so, also, it should be granted to him whose property has become deteriorated on account of the jetsam. Papirius Fronto also stated this in an opinion.

5. Hermogeniamis, Epitomes of Law, Book II.

The contribution of those who saved their merchandise from shipwreck does not indemnify anyone for the loss of the vessel; for it is held that the equity of this contribution is only admitted when, by the remedy of jetsam, during the common danger, the interest of the others is consulted, and the ship is saved.

(1) If the mast is cut away in order that the ship with its merchandise may be freed from danger, there will be an equitable claim for contribution.

6. Julianus, Digest, Book LXXXVI.

A ship beaten by a storm and with her rigging, mast, and yards burned by lightning, was carried into Hippo. Having been provided while there with a hasty and temporary equipment, she sailed for Ostia, and discharged her cargo uninjured. The question was asked whether those to whom the cargo belonged were obliged to contribute to the master of the ship in proportion to the loss? The answer was that they were not obliged to do so, as the expense was incurred rather for the purpose of equipping the ship, than to preserve the cargo.

7. Paulus, Epitomes of the Digest of Alfenus, Book III.

Where a ship is sunk or stranded, the opinion was given that whatever each one saves out of his own property he can keep for himself, just as in case of fire.

8. Julianus, On Minicius, Book II.

Those who throw any property overboard for the purpose of lightening a ship, do not intend to consider it as abandoned; since if they should find it they can carry it away, and if they have any idea of the place where it has been cast by the sea, they can claim it; so that they are in the same condition as anyone who oppressed by a burden throws it down on the road, expecting to return presently with others and remove it.

9. Volusius Mæcianus, On the Rhodian Law.

A petition of Eudaimon of Nicomedia to the Emperor Antoninus; "Lord Emperor Antoninus, having been shipwrecked in Icaria we have been robbed by farmers of the revenue inhabiting the Cyclades Islands." Antoninus answered Eudaimon as follows: "I am, indeed, the Lord of the World, but the Law is the Lord of the sea; and this affair must be decided by the Rhodian law adopted with reference to maritime questions, provided no enactment of ours is opposed to it." The Divine Augustus established the same rule.

10. Labeo, Epitomes of the Probabilities of Paulus, Book I.

If you have made a contract for the transportation of slaves, freight is not due to you for a slave who died on the ship. Paulus says that, in fact, the question is what was agreed upon, whether freight was to be paid for those who were loaded on the ship, or only for those who were carried to their destination? And if this cannot be established, it will be enough for the master of the ship to prove that the slave was placed on board.

(1) If you hired a ship on condition that your merchandise was to be transported by her, and the master of the ship, without being compelled by necessity, placed your property on an inferior vessel, being aware that you did not wish this to be done; and your merchandise was lost, together with the ship in which it was last transported, you will be entitled to an action on the contract of leasing and hiring against the master of the first ship.

Paulus, on the other hand, says that this is not true, provided both ships were lost on the voyage, since it occurred without the malice or negligence of the sailors. The rule is the same if the first master, having been detained by public authority, was prevented from sailing with your merchandise. This rule is also applicable if he entered into a contract with you under the condition that he would pay you a certain penalty if he did not, by a day agreed upon, land your goods in a place to which he had agreed to transport them, and he was not to blame if he did not wait; even though the penalty was remitted to him. We must observe the same rule in a similar imaginary case, where it is proved that the master, having been prevented by illness, was unable to sail, if his ship became unfit for navigation without any malicious intent or negligence of his.

(2) If you hire a ship capable of transporting two thousand jars and place jars on board, you are liable for the freight of two thousand jars. Paulus says that the fact is, if you hire the entire capacity of the ship, the freight for two thousand jars will be due, but if the freight was agreed upon according to the number of jars placed on board, the contrary rule will apply; for you owe for the transportation of as many jars as you placed on board.

If someone hosts someone, known or unknown, for two nights, he can consider him a guest, because if that one commits an offense, he shall not incur damages for that man. But if he who had been injured makes a report to the justice about him, that the offense was committed by his counsel, he will expurgate himself from plan and deed, if he can, by oath with two of his law-worthy neighbors. But if not,83 he shall pay in compensation the damage and the monetary penalty. But if he provides hospitality for a third night, and that man wrongs someone, he shall hold him to right as if one of his own household because, as the English say, tuo niht gest, pridde niht open hine.84 And if he can not hold him to right, he will have a term of a month and a day. And if he can find him, the evildoer himself shall restore the damage that he caused and the penalty if he is able, [and] also of the body if to this he is forfeit. And if the evildoer cannot restore the damage that he caused, the host who had given him hospitality will make restoration and [pay] the monetary penalty. And if the justice holds him suspect, he will clear himself according to the judgment of the hundred or shire.85

The fairies don't always need a reason to bestow good fortune, though: a man came across the fairies dancing on the beach at Puckaster Cove on the Isle of Wight. He joined the dance but, after a while, needed to sit and rest. He sat down on something like a puffball mushroom which burst under his weight, showering gold dust everywhere. The faeries gave him some of this before he parted from their company.

The Whit Well - "Legend tells us that pilgrims visited the well for its healing qualities. They arrived by ship in Puckaster Cove and came via the Cripple Path and Ashknowle Lane to the well. Prayers were said while the sick and suffering bathed in and drank of its cooling waters. Then healed or with hope renewed and full of thanks to Our Lady of Whitewell and her good saint Rhadagunde, they returned to the coast via st, Rhadagunde's Path."

http://tudoraccidents.history.ox.ac.uk/?page_id=177 June 2019. Rock samphire is a succulent coastal plant, nutritious to eat but dangerous to harvest. In shakespeare's King Lear, Edgar and Gloucester look down from a cliff and spot 'one that gathers samphire, dreadful trade'. John Pantridge was practising that trade at Freshwater on the Isle of Wight on 18 June 1576 at a place on the cliffs called 'peppers mede', perhaps near Old Pepper Rock. He fell 170 feet onto the rocks below and broke his neck. One month later, on 20 July, the same fleshy, spicy treat lured John Turle to his doom at Fairlight, sussex. He fell only 13 feet, but it was enough to break 'his hed and scull'. And women as well as men braved the coast for samphire. At Weston-super-Mare in somerset on 27 May 1587, Joan Davys fell on a rock and broke her neck when gathering 'sampyer'.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oyer_and_terminer
In English law, oyer and terminer (/ˈɔɪ.ər ... ˈtɜːrmɪnər/; a partial translation of the Anglo-French oyer et terminer, which literally means "to hear and to determine"[1]) was the Law French name for one of the commissions by which a judge of assize sat. The commission was also known by the Law Latin name audiendo et terminando, and the Old English-derived term soc and sac.
