Harold In Normandy
In 1064, Harold is believed to have sailed to Normandy. How and why he travelled there is a matter of debate, one version is that he had been fishing off the coast of the Isle of Wight when he was caught in a storm and wrecked on the Normandy Coast, where he was forced to swear that William would inherit the crown.

Tostig and Harold
In 1065, Tostig faced a rebellion in his Earldom. He was accused of having 'robbed God first, and then despoiled of life and of land all those he had power over.' Edward the Confessor gave in to the people of Northumbria, and appointed Morcar to the Earldom, despite Harold's objections. Tostig became outlawed.

On January 5th 1066, Edward the Confessor died. At this point, the succession was far from clear, for their were many claimants to the throne, not just two as is often assumed. The obvious successor, appointed by Edward himself, was Edgar Ætheling, grandson of Edmund Ironside, King in 1016. However, he was still a child, and after the last child king, Æthelred the Unready, he was not a popular choice. Other options included Swegn Estrithson, King of Denmark and King Cnut's nephew, Harald Hardrada, King of Norway, Tostig Godwinson, Harold's brother, as well as William and Harold. Yet it was Harold who became King, and in the just over 40 weeks that he ruled, he faced threats of Invasion not only from William, but also from Harald Hardrada and his own brother Tostig.

Tostig was the first to attack, and the first to come to the Isle of Wight. Both he and his brother used the Isle of Wight as a base - Tostig using it to attack, and Harold to defend - similarly to how their father, Godwine, had used the Isle of Wight in 1052.

1066 - In this year King Harold came from York to Westminster at the Easter which was after the midwinter that the King passed away; and Easter was then on the 16th April. Then throughout all England, a sign such as men never saw before was seen in the heavens. Some men declared that it was the star comet, which some men call the haired star, and it appeared first on the eve of the Greater Litany, 24th April, and shone thus all the week.

And soon thereafter came Earl Tostig from beyond the sea into Wight, and with as great a fleet as he could get, and there was given both money and provisions; and then went from there, and did harm everywhere along the sea-cost he could get to, until he came to Sandwich. And King Harold, his brother, gathered a greater raiding ship-army and also raiding land-army than any King here in the land had ever done before, because he was informed that William the bastard6 wanted to come here and win this land, just as afterward it came to pass.

Then when Tostig found out that King Harold was on his way to Sandwich, he went from Sandwich, and took some of the boatmen with him, and went North into Humber, and there raided in Lindsey and killed many good men there. ...And then he went to Scotland - and Malcolm III the King of Scots7 gave him safe-conduct and helped him with provisions - and lived there all summer.

Then King Harold came to Sandwich and waited for his fleet there, because it was long before it could be gathered. And then when his fleet was gathered, he went into Wight, and lay there all the summer and the autumn; and a land army was kept everywhere by the sea, although in the end it was to no avail. Then when it was the Nativity of St. Mary, the men's provisions were gone, and no-one could hold them there any longer. Then the men were allowed to go home, and the King rode inland, and the ships were sent to London, and many perished before they came there.

Then when they came home, King Harald Hardrada from Norway then came by surprise north into the Tyne, with a very great raiding ship-army - and no little one, it could be 300 ships or more and Tostig submitted to him and became his man, and they went into the Humber until they came to York, and there Earl Edwin and Earl Morcar8, his brother, fought against them, but the Northmen had the victory. Then Harold, King of the English, was informed that this had come about there - and this fight was on the Vigil of St Matthew. Then Harold our King came upon the Northmen by surprise, and encountered them beyond York at Stamford Bridge with a great raiding-army of English people; and there was that day a very hard fight on both sides.

There were killed Harald Fine-Hair and Earl Tostig, and the Northmen who remained there were put to flight...

Harold had managed to defeat the combined forces of Tostig and King Harald Hardrada, which in many ways was a threat more serious than that of Duke William. Certainly the army was larger than William's. Yet soon after the Battle of Stamford Bridge, William invaded, and at the Battle of Hastings, won.

After the Battle of Hastings, Anglo-Saxon Britain had come to an end, and the Isle of Wight as well as the rest of England entered into the Norman era.

Harold Godwinson ascended to the English throne on January 6, 1066, following the death of King Edward the Confessor. His claim was contested by several rivals, most notably William of Normandy, who asserted that Edward had promised him the throne. Additionally, Harald Hardrada of Norway also laid claim to the English crown, leading to a year fraught with military threats.


January 1066: Harold is crowned King of England, but his claim is immediately challenged by William of Normandy and Harald Hardrada.

Summer 1066: Anticipating an invasion, Harold gathers forces along the southern coast of England. However, the expected Norman invasion is delayed due to unfavorable winds.
September 1066: Harald Hardrada invades from the north, forcing Harold to march his army to confront this threat.

On September 18, 1066, Harold Godwinson, the last Anglo-Saxon king of England, landed on the Isle of Wight with his army. This strategic move was part of his preparations to defend England against the anticipated Norman invasion led by William, Duke of Normandy.

Strategic Position: The Isle of Wight served as a crucial staging ground for Harold's forces. Its location allowed him to monitor the southern coast and respond quickly to any Norman landings.

Military Preparations: Harold's army, composed of housecarls (professional soldiers) and the fyrd (local militia), was on high alert. They were prepared to march at a moment's notice to repel the Norman forces.

In January 1066, King Edward died, and Harold Godwinson was proclaimed King Harold II. William immediately disputed his claim. In addition, King Harald III Hardraade of Norway had designs on England, as did Tostig, brother of Harold. King Harold rallied his forces for an expected invasion by William, but Tostig launched a series of raids instead, forcing the king to leave the English Channel unprotected. In September, Tostig joined forces with King Harald III and invaded England from Scotland. On September 25, Harold met them at Stamford Bridge and defeated and killed them both. Three days later, William landed in England at Pevensey.

With approximately 7,000 troops and cavalry, William seized Pevensey and marched to Hastings, where he paused to organize his forces. On October 13, Harold arrived near Hastings with his army, and the next day William led his forces out to give battle. At the end of a bloody, all-day battle, King Harold II was killed—shot in the eye with an arrow, according to legend—and his forces were defeated.
