*Honourable(?)* Marion Shaw Mellor
http://www.boxpeopleandplaces.co.uk/mothers-union.html "The Box branch was started in 1925 by the indomitable, the Honourable Mrs Dora Marion Shaw Mellor, daughter of Lord Alverstone, Lord Chief Justice"  "The Arthur Webster Hospital, opened in 1905, was presented to the town of Shanklin, Isle of Wight by Lord Alverstone in memory of his son."

Box House
"The Hon Dora Marion Shaw Mellor, 1921
http://www.boxpeopleandplaces.co.uk/box-house.html
Anyone who has read PG Wodehouse's Jeeves and Wooster novels will have a mental picture of Bertie Wooster’s nemesis, aunt Agatha, who he describes as someone who could chew on broken glass and wore barbed wire next to her skin. If a description of Dora Shaw Mellor is accurate, she modelled herself on Bertie’s Aunt.
One Box resident of the time described Mrs Shaw Mellor as a formidable lady, large in stature, and since she always wore high heels required assistance to remain on her feet, particularly when visiting the Scout Hall in her capacity as President of the Guides Committee. The Shaw Mellors became resident at Box House from the early 1920s.
The Hon Dora Shaw Mellor, born 18th May 1873, was daughter of Richard Everard Webster and his wife Louisa Mary. She was a woman brought up in high Victorian society; her father was a distinguished lawyer and a staunch Conservative. In 1900 he was appointed Lord Chief Justice of England and made a baron. In 1913 he was raised to the peerage as Lord Alverstoke, 1st Viscount Alverstoke. Sadly Dora’s brother, who died of appendicitis, without issue, would have been the 2nd Viscount, but the title became extinct.
Dora was born and raised in Kensington and on the 19th, April 1902, she married Arthur Shaw Mellor, a medical practitioner from Paddington and subsequently lived there. Arthur was himself the son of a distinguished lawyer who was Master of the Crown Office. Almost certainly the two families knew each other socially.

Mrs Shaw Mellor, characteristic of her breed, was at the centre of village life and involved with the Guides, the Church and the Mothers' Union. She was the mother of three daughters but her eldest daughter, Joan Marion, died in 1923, just 20 years old. The family had a memorial mounted close to the pulpit in her memory.
"Also in the Church is an embroidered banner presented by the Mothers' Union reflecting the skill of among others Dora Shaw Mellor.[2] The Hon Dora Marion Shaw Mellor died in 1954 and her husband, Arthur, 13 years later in 1967."

Box, Wiltshire, on the road from Chippenham to Bath
"The Box branch (Mothers' Union)was started in 1925 by the indomitable, the Honourable Mrs Dora Marion Shaw Mellor, daughter of Lord Alverstone, Lord Chief Justice. Rev George and Mrs Kate Foster had fundraised to pump-prime the local branch and sixty women met up at the inaugural meeting.[1] Mrs Shaw Mellor spoke about the main concerns of the Box branch: to revive Mothering Sunday observance on the fourth Sunday of Lent and upholding the sanctity of marriage through the power of prayer."

The building is still in use as the Arthur Webster Clinic."

"In January 1900 he was created a Baronet,[5] but in May the same year succeeded Sir Nathaniel Lindley as Master of the Rolls, being raised to the peerage as Baron Alverstone, of Alverstone in the County of Southampton[6] and sworn of the Privy Council,[7] and in October of the same year he was elevated to the office of Lord Chief Justice"

"He was well known as an athlete in his earlier years, having represented his university in the first Inter-Varsity steeplechase and as a runner. As such, the Cambridge University Alverstone Club is named in his honour, and makes a pilgrimage to Alverstone, Isle of Wight, every 4 years."
