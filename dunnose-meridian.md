art. 1. Of Particulars relative to the Commencement of the Trigonometrical Operation.

Having, by the re-measurement of the base on Hounslow Heath, sufficiently determined its accuracy, it became necessary, upon the approach of the following spring, to form some plan which might enable us to commence the survey with the most advantage.

Of those which were suggested, that of proceeding immediately to the southward with a series of triangles seemed the most eligible, not only because, in the first instance, the execution of it would forward one great design of the business, in an early determination of some principal points upon the seacoast, but also because a junction of the eastern part of the series with that of the western of General Roy, would afford an early proof of what degree of accuracy had attended both operations.

To ascertain the truth of the General's work, by verifying some principal distance or distances, was an object which presented itself, not only as interesting and curious, but as highly necessary, in order to determine whether, by the result, the triangles might stand good, and become a part of the general series.

In addition to this reason, there was another which offered itself, and that was, the prospect of being able to obtain the length of a degree of longitude in an early stage of the survey ; for it had been suggested, and upon inquiry was found to be true, that Dunnose in the Isle of Wight was visible, in particular moments of fine weather, from Beachy Head on the coast of Sussex : but attention was at the same time given to the recommendation of General Roy, in the selection of Shooter s Hill and Nettlebed, as places for observing the directions of the meridian ; and it was resolved, whatever preference might in future be given to those on the coast for this important operation, that at all events such observations should be made, as might determine the distance between the stations recommended by the General.

p458

As the principal object of this year's business was, to determine the directions of the meridians, the party left London for the Isle of Wight early in the month of March, that it might arrive at Dunnose in proper time for making the required observations. The instrument, however, was first taken to Motteston Down, for the purpose of intersecting many places whose bearings had been last year taken when the instrument was at Rook’s Hill, and which were now wanted by the surveyors of the Ordnance. This station had been selected for that purpose, and was never intended to become a principal one in the series ; but when the instrument was on the spot, it was considered as proper that some observations should be made to the stations which were at that time chosen. Jor this reason, when the time for observing the star approached, and most of the lights had been fired without our having seen them, it was not considered of consequence to remain there any longer, and the instrument was therefore taken to Dunnose.

A small staff, of about three inches diameter, was erected on Brading Down, which is about six miles from the station, for the purpose of referring the star to it ; a small lamp of six inches diameter, constructed upon the same plan as the large ones, being, when made use of, buckled at the bottom of the staff.

As the best method of obtaining the direction of the meridian, is by observing the star upon each side of the pole, whence the double azimuth is nearly obtained without any correction for the star’s apparent motions, every opportunity was watched, of observing it at the times of its greatest apparent eastern and western elongations. But in the unsettled season of the month of April, when almost every wind brought a fog over the station, many days elapsed without our seeing either the star or staff ; and it was on that account we continued so long at Dunnose.

As the truth of the deductions must entirely depend on the accurate determination of the directions of the meridians, the greatest care was taken in making the observations. An hour, and generally more, before the star came to its greatest elongation, the observers repaired to the tent for the purpose of getting the instrument ready. The method of adjusting it, was first by levelling it in the common way with the spirit level which hangs on the brass pins ; and afterwards, by that which applies to the axis of the transit: The criterion which determined the instrument to be properly adjusted, was the bubble of the latter level remaining immoveable between its indexes, while the circle was turned round the axis.

XVI. An Account of the Measurement of an Arc of the Meridian, extending from Dunnose, in the Isle of Wight, Latitude go° S7 ; 8", to Clifton, in Yorkshire, Latitude 53 27' 3!", in course of the Operations carried on for the Trigonometrical Survey of England, in the Years i8oo 5 1801, and 1802* By Major William Mudge, of the Royal Artillery, F. R. S.

Read June 23, 1803

In the last account presented to the Royal Society, I expressed my intentions of making the operations which were to follow that period, subservient; to the purpose of measuring a portion of the meridional arc, running from Dunnose, in the Isle of Wight, into the northern part of Yorkshire.

...

It is proper I should state, more fully than I have formerly done, my reasons for selecting Dunnose as one of the extremities of my meridional line, and also those for preferring its meridian to any other; which I shall do as briefly as possible.

In a country whose surface, throughout its whole extent, is equally diversified with hilly ground, that particular part of It should be chosen, for carrying on a meridional measurement^ which comprehends the most extensive arc. This arises from the necessary consequence which attends an operation in a country so circumstanced ; as, possibly, no spot fixed on for a place of observation, could be supposed free from the effects of the unequal attraction in the adjoining matter. In such a country, therefore^ a measurement upon the most extensive arc, must give the most accurate conclusion ; for the errors arising from the cause here mentioned, like those of observation, lessen in their effects^ on their application to arcs of increasing magnitude*

If Great Britain were a country thus diversified, the most eligible part would be that where the meridian from Lyme, in Dorsetshire, passes northward into Scotland, The difference of latitude between that place and Aberdeen, near to which that line cuts its parallel, is 4 47', nearly. But, however great the advantages attending such a length of arc might be, undetf the general circumstances of accurate terrestrial measurement, and accurate observations at its extremities, no beneficial consequences could be expected to attend the placing of the sector at intermediate stations ; as the arc would be found running, almost every where, through a country abounding with hills, considerable both in magnitude and number.

Under this consideration, I determined to measure a portion of the meridian which proceeds from Dunnose to the mouth of the Tees ; because, from inquiry, I had reason to suppose it thelongest meridional arc In Britain , free from any apparent ob* struction. And I was led to select Dunnose for one of its extremities, as observations made there, in conjunction with others at Greenwich, would enable me to make corrections of the latitudes of places given in our former papers, if found necessary. By fixing on Dunnose, I had also the means of ascertaining the distance of the Royal Observatory from the northern or southern end of my line, and, consequently, of connecting it with the parallels of Dunkirk and Paris.

Dunnose being fixed on, my subsequent endeavours were directed towards carrying on the triangles, as nearly as 1 possibly could, in the direction of its meridian, selecting the stations so that their sides might be properly inclined to it, and of suffix dent length. In choosing the station at the northern extremity j I was careful to select it as near the meridian of the southern one as possible, and likewise in the neighbourhood of some open spot of ground, proper for the measurement of a base of verification. A station having these advantages, was found near Clifton, a small village in the vicinity of Doncaster; and a level of sufficient extent for a base, on Misterton Carr, in the northern part of Lincolnshire.

Particulars relating to the Operations of the Year 1802,

I have already stated, that a proper observatory had been provided for the reception of the zenith sector. The dimensions of it were twelve feet square at bottom, and six feet square at top; its proportions being the same as those of the external stand. A floor having a square vacuity, to admit of the instrument standing on the ground, covered the joists of it. The sides of the observatory were of strong painted canvas ; and the roof of wood, with an aperture, which could be opened or closed at pleasure, for viewing the stars near the zenith.

The instrument, with this observatory, was erected in the Tower on the 3d of April, merely to examine all its parts, and to ascertain whether any thing could be done to render it more perfect. Some trifling addenda were accordingly made, and the whole, thus rendered perfect, was removed to the Royal Observatory, and erected in the garden of the Astronomer Royal, close to the eastern extremity of the transit room.

I am now to specify, that my intentions were to devote, from this period, the whole or the greatest part of the following summer, to the use of this sector; nor did I indeed imagine such a portion of time more than sufficient I purposed to erect it at Dunnose, and at Clifton, the extremities of my arc ; and also at Arbury Hill, near Daventry, the station almost in the middle of it. This last station I fixed upon, because it was proper to ascertain how far the observations for determining the extent of the whole arc, would agree with any others made for finding the value of its parts. The erecting of it at Greenwich was necessary, for the purpose of observing the zenith distances of certain stars, which were afterwards to be observed at Dunnose, thereby affording means of ascertaining the latitude of that station.

The instrument remained at the Royal Observatory till the 26th of April; and, although the weather was for most part of the time unfavourable, yet the erecting of it there will be found, as appears in a future part of this work, to have answered the proposed end. One very material service accrued to myself; this was, the advice and instruction I received from the Astronomer Royal, for the successful management of the sector, by which I scrupulously governed myself throughout the whole of the subsequent campaign. Having observed the zenith distances of some few stars, and made myself completely master of every adjustment about the instrument, the sector, with all its apparatus, was sent to the Isle of Wight, by way of Southampton ; every possible care being used to protect it from injury, not only while transporting by land, but also when under the act of being taken into, and removed out of, the vessel which conveyed

it from that place to Cowes. It will be readily supposed, that watchfulness and care were necessary, to preserve this complicated instrument from being damaged by accident or roughness of the roads.

In the year 1794, an iron cannon was sunk in the ground, for the purpose of permanently preserving the point on Dunnose, where the direction of the meridian was observed in VJQ& It must be now remarked, that the cannon so inserted could not have its breech placed so low as might have been wished ; in consequence of which, it became necessary to erect the observatory for the reception of the sector some little distance southward of the old station. The distance from the centre of the gun to the point over which the instrument was afterwards erected, was six feet and a half.

To procure for the external stand, and thence for the whole apparatus, a firm foundation, I caused four long stakes to be driven into the ground, one for each foot of the stand, to which its feet were firmly screwed down. The surfaces of the stakes were then cut off smooth, and brought into the same horizontal plane, by which means, the interior frame and sector were placed much within the limits of their several adjustments.

The pointed top of Sir Richard Worsley's obelisk afforded me an excellent means for bringing, with the assistance of the side telescope and azimuth circle, the plane of the arch into the true meridian. The distance and magnitude of that object is extremely convenient for the purpose. Its bearing from the meridian of the station is 87 42' 33", as I shall show in its proper place. The side telescope was turned to this object very frequently ; and I never found the vernier, on the azimuth circle^

to indicate any serious warp in the standi Its greatest variation was 4'; but, for several days together, it did not amount to

30".

The weight of the plummet, I adjusted to the strength of the plumb-line, in the usual way. I suspended it in air, and gradually increased its weight, till the wire broke. This plummet was then immersed in the vessel appropriated for its reception. It will, perhaps, not; be improper to observe, that I was careful to give the plummet its maximum of weight, that its wire might not be subject to motion from streams of air*

As it was to be apprehended that errors would result, from the effects of an inequality of temperature in the air within the observatory, I placed two thermometers, both adjusted to a third; near the telescope. One I elevated as high as the axis, the other I laid on the hollow brass cylinders which connect the divided arch with that behind it usually called the back arch. In the day, I found (as may be seen in the register of observations) the heat a little greater at the top of the tent than towards the bottom ; and the reverse was generally the case at night.

To equalize the temperature at those times when the sun shone out, or the weather was hot, I opened the shutters in the roof, as well as the door of the observatory, a considerable time before the moment of observation. By these means, the air within the tent was rendered tolerably uniform in its degrees of heat. For the space of a week following the commencement of my observations, I suspended a third thermometer from the milled-headed key which turns the diaphragm placed inside the telescope. As the situation of this thermometer was midway between the two others just mentioned, I always found the temperature there, a mean between those degrees shown by the upper and under thermometers ; and as, in the course of the time specified, I had various opportunities of satisfying myself on this point, I desisted from making any farther use of it. For the purpose of ascertaining the limits of the errors likely to result from the cause now spoken of, it will be right to institute some little inquiry into its mode of operation.

Mudge also needed to measure the relative heights of the trig points, and he did so by a process called ‘levelling’. A spirit level was used to provide the position of a sight line that travelled horizontally from a ‘levelling telescope’ at trig station A. Trig station B was at a different height from A, say fifty feet higher, and there a surveyor manipulated a ‘levelling rod’ (a staff marked with measurements of length) so that it dropped vertically towards the hor¬ izontal sight line from A. The observer at that first trig point noted where the vertical rod met the telescope’s horizontal sight line, and used the rod’s measurements to ascertain the vertical difference between the two trig points. In May 1793 Mudge used this levelling method to ascertain the height of a trig station at Dunnose, on the Isle of Wight, above the low-water mark. Using a spirit level, he positioned a telescope (on an instrument called a ‘transit’) on the horizontal from the trig point and trained it towards the coast at Shanklin. There his assistants used a measuring tape and rods, which they positioned vertically up a cliff face, to discover the 792-foot ver¬ tical distance that separated the height of the trig station from ‘the water’s edge’. Over longer distances, levelling could be done trigonometrically. The theodolite’s telescope could be trained from one trig point to another at a different height, and the angle that separated the telescope from the hori¬ zontal could be used in a trigonometric equation to determine the vertical distance between them.

English artillery officer and surveyor, born in Plymouth, 

He was appointed in 1791 to the Ordnance Trigonometrical Survey, of which he was promoted to be director on the death of Colonel Edward Williams in 1798. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society the same year.[1]

Around 1800 Dunnose was taken as a base point for a triangulation of Great Britain, in which Mudge measured a section of the meridional arc running up into Yorkshire.[2] The triangulation was conducted in 1801 and 1802.[3] The positions of twenty three points between Dunnose[a] and Beacon Hill, Clifton, near Doncaster, were determined, and the closest possible measurements were made of the distances between the points and the direction from one point to another.[5] Doubts were cast on the accuracy of the measurements in 1812, when Joseph Rodriguez pointed out that, if they were accurate, the length of a degree of longitude did not vary with latitude as it should if the earth were flattened at the poles.[6]

Dunnose in the Isle of Wight presents itself as highly eligible, not only because it is removed the necessary distance from the meridian of Greenwich, but also because it commands a most extensive view of the western coast : therefore, as the direction of the meridian was observed on this station in 1793, (see Philosophical Transactions for 1795, p. 517 ) it became necessary to fix on three places only.

In the selection of these stations, it was our wish to have found such as should lie nearly in the same parallel, each intermediate one being visible from those east and west of it ; by which means, the differences of latitude between their respective parallels would be accurately determined.

When tire party was at Dunnose, in the year 1793, a hill at a very considerable distance, in a direction very nearly west, was seen just rising out of the horizon. It then occurred to us that this spot would, at some future period, be a very proper one for a station whereon a new direction of the meridian might be observed. Experience, in the Survey of 17 95, led us to believe this hill was actually Black Down in Dorsetshire; therefore it was determined that our operations should commence at that station, and the event verified the truth of our suppositions.

147. Height of the Station at Dunnose.

With a view to obtain the heights of the stations nearly, from their elevations or depressions, we determined the height of that at Dunnosc above low water, in May, 1793, ty levelling down to the sea shore near Shanklin, a distance of about a mile. Instead of a levelling telescope, we made use of the transit instrument, which, on account of its very accurate spirit level, seems extremely well adapted for the purpose. Two circular wooden platforms were provided, broad enough for the feet of the transit stand ; these platforms rested on pegs driven into the ground, and were always made horizontal at the time of levelling, by means of a mahogany spar, or straight-edge, furnished with a spirit level. The graduated rods, of course, were constantly set vertical on the lowest platform, while the transit stood on the other.

The ground is favourable enough down to Shanklin Chine: this is a large deep chasm, opening to the sea ; but the descent is not so sudden on the western side, which is by far the steepest, and to which we levelled, but a person may get up or down with safety. We found its perpendicular height by means of several rods placed end ways against the sloping side, and supported in an horizontal position, and then letting fall a measuring tape from one rod to another : but this was the most troublesome and difficult part of the whole operation. The fall from the bottom of this chasm or opening, to the water's edge, was found in the usual manner.

The whole perpendicular descent thus determined, was 792 feet; which, we have no reason to suppose, is more than 2 or 3 feet wide of the truth. We finished at low water on May 10 ; and therefore the height of the station above low water at spring tides will, no doubt, be a very few feet more.

In 1793 the triangulating operations were and observations to determine the direction of the meridian at Dunnose, in the Isle of Wight, were taken with great — care in the month of April, by means of azimuths of the pole-star continued, at its maximum apparent elongations. Similar observations were tried at Beachy Head in July; but, owing to the unsteadiness or tremulousness of the atmosphere from heat, the attempt there had to be deferred. In this and the — next year, special surveys of the Hampshire coast were undertaken, and mapped on a scale of three inches to a mile; but these were for purely confidential’ military purposes.

In the summer of 1794, a highly important base of verification, nearly 7 miles long, was measured on Salisbury Plain with the steel chain. Again the labours of the Ordnance officers attracted much attention from the leaders of science,—Sir Joseph Banks, Maskejyne, astronomer-royal, and others, visiting the work during its proUpon this line was after-

wards mainly to hang the entire triangulation of the kingdom. The h of the arc of parallel in the mean latitude between Beachy

‘Head and Dunnose was also geometrically ascertained.

During jhis and the following year, the triangulation was carried on into the counties of Dorse and Devon, and for military objects into Kent. Cornwall was reached in 1796, the

incipal occupation of this year fring the taking of observations to determine the distance of the Silly Isles from the Land's End, avery awkward piece of work in trigonometrical computation, owing tothe unavoidable shortness of any obtainable base in the locality. This difficulty was to some extent counteracted by the‘ circumstance that, while the party was engaged in these observations, "the air was so unusually clear, that one could sometimes, with the telescope of the great theodolite, descern the soldiers at exercise in St Mary’s Island," a long sight to accomplish, considering that the distance of the Scilly stations from the Cornish mainland averaged nearly 30 miles. In 1798, another base-line of verification was measured at Sedgemoor, in Somersetshire, 27,680 feet, or a trifle under 5% miles in length; and during this and the last year of the century, the triangulation, besides being extended over Kent, was carried along the valley of the Thames, and into Essex, Suffolk, Somerset, and some of the midland counties. This year the direction of the Survey passed from Colonel Williams to Captain (afterwards Major-General) Mudge, who retained it till his death in the opening year of the new century the Survey sustained a great loss in the retirement from it of Mr. Isaac Dalby, F.R.S., who had hitherto taken a leading part in all the more difficult and important branches of the work, and whose arduous labours had broken down his health. During the three years 1800 to 1802, the main business was the measurement of a meridional arc nearly 200 miles long. The stations selected for the terminals of the arc were Dunnose and C)ifton, in Yorkshire, very nearly in the same meridian—the latter lying less than a mile to westward of the former. Arbury Hill, in Northamptonshire, formed an intermediate station something near half-way between the terminals.

Saunders's News-Letter - Wednesday 16 September 1846

British Association for Advancement of Science

During this part the voyage the President expressed a hope that Sir John Herschell would give them some explanation of the remarkable abberration in the plumb line which he alluded to in his inaugural address, as having been discovered during the trigonometrical survey at Dunnose. For his own part, could only attempt to account for the phenomenon as a geologist, by supposing that there was a mass plutonic rock great density somewhere beneath the surface in this part the coast, which attracted the plummet.

Sir John Herschell came forward and proceeded to explain his view the probable cause of the phenomenon, in a very interesting manner. He said he supposed it could only be accounted for by the inequality in the gravity of the materials of the globe. If the earth were a perfect sphere or there would be no exception the general rule of gravitation. Wherever a portion of the crust of the earth was formed of light bodies, the specific gravity was less, and there was deficit of the mean density; but where the specific gravity was greater than the mean density there was excess. It was evident that the deviation of the plumb-line at Dunnose to so great an extent that of 3 seconds, as compared with Greenwich, must arise from some local cause. If no such alteration took place the astronomical amplitude should coincide with the geodesic amplitude, and the latter would show the true latitude of place. In three stations near Dunnose, however, it was found that there was a deviation of the plumb line, compared with Greenwich, which would make the astronomic amplitude exceed the geodesic amplitude. This would imply that there was too much curvature of the earth at this point. Of course he did not mean the curvature of the inequalities the actual surface, but of the imaginary surface, which was independent of them. In the three stations which he alluded there was an excess of gravitation as compared with Dunnose, though on going the whole way to Greenwich there was a defect. This would show the existence of some dense body near Dunnose, though whether situated to the north or the south it he found it impossible to say.

Around 1800 Dunnose was taken as a base point for a triangulation of Great Britain, in which Captain William Mudge measured a section of the meridional arc running up into Yorkshire.[3] The triangulation was conducted in 1801 and 1802.[4] The positions of twenty three points between Dunnose[a] and Beacon Hill, Clifton, near Doncaster, were determined, and the closest possible measurements were made of the distances between the points and the direction from one point to another.[6] 

The Retriangulation of Great Britain that began in 1935 again took Dunnose as a base point. Dunnose also was the origin (meridian) of the 6 inch and 1:2500 Ordnance Survey maps for the central group of English counties: they were Derbyshire, Nottinghamshire, Lincolnshire, Staffordshire, Warwickshire, Worcestershire, Leicestershire, Rutlandshire, Northamptonshire, Gloucestershire, Oxfordshire, Buckinghamshire, Wiltshire, Berkshire, Hampshire and the Isle of Wight
