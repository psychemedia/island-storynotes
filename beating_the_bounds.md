# Beating the Bounds

A tradition whereby parishioners walk round a parish boundary, hitting various markers with a stick to establigh the boundary point. May involve beating people with a stick, or, as a report from WInchester in 1900 suggests, giving them "the bumps" at the same point, so they remember...

*Grayson Perry referenced the general tradition in his Reith Lecture.*

BEATING THE BOUNDS AT NORTHWOOD.

The old custom of beating the bounds was revived Northwood on Thursday. In connection with the perambulation a Rogation service, with prayers for the crops, was held a fortnight ago. The party of walkers assembled the Rectory shortly before 4, and after tea started on the road to Newport. The party comprised the Rector (the Rev. A. W. Milroy), the Rev. G. D. Debenham, Messrs. G. H. Jerrom and David Brown (churchwardens). Mr. G. Fellows, C.C., Mr. F. W. Wilson, Mr. Peers, and a dozen boys. The parish is bounded on the north, east, and west sides by water, and also on part the south-east side by the Dodnor stream, which flows through Parkhurst Prison and at the foot of Horsebridge-hill The procession started from the point where the parish bounded by land and went past Ward's Copse, aoroes she Forest-road, through the fields, to tbs north of the Pallance-gate bouses, which lie just outside the parish, thence to Marks's-corner, where two bouses are outside the line, thence to Whitehouae and to Coffin Copse, near Porchfield, which is the extreme south west corner of the parish. From here the course was straight to the north over the hill above Thorness Bay known as Mark-closecorner, and thence through the copse the sea-shore. Here a cairn was erected and cheers were given for the perish and the parish officers. Then all gathered round in circle by the sea, across which the sun was just setting, and interesting little meeting was held. The Rector, after saying that the ceremony had been most enjoyable, quoted from the homily about greedinees of men ploughing and grating upon their neighbor's land, and upon common "balks and walks, where their ancestors left of their land a broad and sufficient bier-balk to carry tbe corpse to tbe Christian sepulture." "These strange encroachments, good neighbours, should be looked upon, these should be considered in these days of our perambulations; and afterward tbe parties monished and charitably reformed who be the doers of such a private gaining to the slander of the township and to the hindrance of the poor." After few words from the Rev. G. D. Debenbam, Mr. Fellows spoke of special interest of this perambulation, which would be the last under tbe present order of things, and hoped the boys would remember the parish bounds they had beaten that day and so be able to tell in days to come of what Northwood was before the passing of tbe Parish Councils Act. The meeting closed with the singing of the Doxology and with prayer.

THE SAME 150 YEARS AGO.

The following account of tbe same ceremony 150 years ago is copied *verbatim* from the original record —

"May ye 30, 1764.— Being Ascension Day the Rev. D. Knail, vicar of Carisbrook with Newport and Northwood, Mr. George Maynard, churchwardens, and several others .... went in parambulation round ye bounds or limits of the parish of Northwood. 1st we met at the church as usual, and from thence went to Werrow, where we had breakfast, and from thence down to ye brook or luck at ye sooth-west corner Werrow Farm, and so up ye brook to ye foot-bridge that goeth over the brook at the north side of Bexley hill and leads to Newport. Upon the west side of which bridge and at the north side of which lock is ye first landmark or boundstone which was in ye forme of a chair or seat, but now part of it is broken off. This stone divides between ye commons in ye forest belonging to Werrow and Noke. Thence we proceeded to ye new stone bridge in ye roadway that leadeth from Cowes to Newport and parteth our new road from that which was done by subscription, where we had the music attend us. The second boundstone is a broad flat stone which lyeth on ye north side of ye said brook close by ye current in ye way that leadeth from Scutsfield gate to Carisbrook. The third boondstone is about 40 lug distant from ye aforesaid, on ye same side of ye brook on ye way that leadeth from Crockers-gate or Noke-corner to Newport. This stone is be maintained by Noke Farm and divideth between Noke Common and ye forest, and is marked E.M., which stands for Edward Meadmore, who in 1673 and long before possessed Noke Farm. From thence we went up to Noke Corner and so to Wedge-gate, alias Crockers-gate, which leads to Crockers, thence all along the bottom to Pallance gate. Thence to ye gate that leads to Rew Street and so up ye hill to ye corner of Youngwoods, where we stopped and drank some beer, the music playing. Then down through Youngwoods by Stackwell, alias Stapless grounds, and so up to Heath-hilis, alias Heathfield, at the Forest-gate leading from Newport to Great Thorness, the hedge being all along our bounds. A little beyond which gate in ye north-west corner of ye forest another gate which leadeth to Bunce-hill, at which oorner Carisbrook, Northwood, and Shalfleet parishes meet together. Thence we leave ye forest and go in at ye gate aforesaid and take in all ye grounds belonging to Heathfield and Great Thorness till we come to ye south-east corner of Burntwood, part Sir John Barrington's land belonging to Elsmore, at which place Northwood, Calborn, and Shalfleet parishes meet. Thence all along ye east side of Burntwood to Mark-close-corner and should have gone right down to ye seaside, but ye bushes being thick we could not go down, so we concluded at ye above corner with singing ye 103 Psalm with becoming reverence, being joined by ye music."

AN OLD CUSTOM.—An ancient territorial rite was renewed this week in connection with the Fleming Estate. In order to preserve intact the boundaries of the property, which extends from the Binstead shore south to Horringford, the process of "beating the bounds" was indulged in, after a lapse, according to records, of seventy-eight years. The beating process was performed at intervals along the boundary of the estate, all through Wednesday and Thursday, the ceremonial being commenced at Binstead, and ending at Horringford. The beaters consisted of three youths from the parishes of Binstead, Haven Street and Arreton, who were accompanied on the round by the Estate representative, the Lord of the Manor (Mr. J. Willis Fleming) and his sons. At intervals they were called upon to testify, in writing, that they had performed their arduous duties.

*A more comprehensive report of the same event by one of the schoolboys involved can be found on the Folk on Wight website.*

> From the County Schools' Monthly Journal, 1910. Before written maps were common, beating
the bounds was the way parishes, landowners and institutions reminded people of important
boundaries in their home area. The custom is believed to date to before 1000 AD. Local
dignitaries and villagers would walk around the boundaries every spring, traditionally during
the fifth week after Easter.
>
> Beating the bounds was a vital part of a child's education. Learning might be reinforced in
unpleasant ways, such as whipping children at boundary stones, knocking heads on a marker
or making them run through mud or water. More enjoyable methods were also used to help
memory. Children were encouraged to beat the boundary stones with sticks or willow rods
and were given treats of food or drink. Thank you to Peter Yardley for this contribution

AN OLD TIME CUSTOM.—BEATING THE BOUNDARY ON THE FLEMING ESTATE.

ON Wednesday, April 13th, a party consisting of Squire Fleming, his two sons, Mr. Arnold (steward), three boys from Havenstreet, two from Binstead, and many farmers and private gentlemen, started from Binstead shore to beat the boundary of the Fleming Estate. After leaving the shore we went due south to Binstead, through a tunnel under the road; the water up to our waists. The younger son of the Squire was stepping on to a stone to escape getting wet when the stone slipped from under his foot and he fell into the water, getting a thorough wetting. We all had a good laugh, which the young gentleman took in good part, and we continued our way through the tunnel. We then went through some fields, going along the bottom of the Common; through some more fields, and then through Stroud Farm to Mr. Plumbley's, Kemphill, where we had some lemonade. After this we passed through some more fields near Ashey Station, then followed the brook to Pondcast, and on to Chillingwood, where we had our luncheon. At 2.15 p.m. we started again on our tour, following the brook through Chillingwood Copse into Little and Big Duxmoor Fields, along the bottom of the Downs, then across the road. Here we stopped to put in a boundary stone. This was done by one of Squire Fleming's workmen named Gray and the help of the Squire's two sons. We then went on through the fields of different farms, until we came nearly to Newchurch Station. Here we beat the stream to Horringford Station, and there we finished for the day. At Heasely Farm we had some tea, and started for home, arriving there about 6 p.m., the distance covered being about 17 or 18 miles.

Next day (Thursday) we again started to beat the other part of the boundary. Our starting place was Quarr Abbey. From here we went to Binstead Shore, walking along to Fishbourne, then through some fields into Ash Lake Copse. Here we took the middle of the road as the boundary and walked back to our starting place. The Squire, Steward, and four more of our party went round to Binstead Shore and took boat to Wootton; the rest walked. Then we walked along Mill Pond out to the Marsh. Here we crossed the water and followed the stream along to Blackbridge. We then crossed the railway line and through farmer Brown's fields into his farm, where we had lunch at 1.30 p.m. After lunch we all had our photographs taken by a man from Binstead. We now went on our way to Blacklands Bridge, taking the road all the way. Then we crossed some fields, out again into the road, past the Hare and Hounds Inn, on towards Arreton. Climbing round a chalk pit, we crossed some fields, went through people's gardens, and came round by Arreton Bible Christian Chapel. Then we came to a high hedge belonging to a garden. We had to use a ladder to get over it. We went on through some fields and gardens till we came to our finishing place, at Horringford Station. The Squire, addressing us, said how very pleased he was to think he could say we had beaten the boundary of his estate. He also told us boys he hoped we should keep our sticks which we had used as a memento of our journey over his estate. I am sure I shall keep and value mine, and I trust never to forget the few days I spent in "Beating the Boundary" of the Fleming Estate. Not only was it most enjoyable, but very instructive, teaching me the extent of the estate and also a good deal of the geography of the Island. At Heasley Farm we had some tea, after which we made tracks for home, arriving about 6.30 p.m., having covered in all about 40 miles. I may say that our doing this was reviving an old custom, which used to be carried out annually in years gone by.

BEATING BOROUGH BOUNDS.

Ancient Custom in Newport.

REVIVED AFTER ALMOST A CENTURY.

The ancient ceremony of beating the borough bounds was revived on Thursday at Newport, Isle of Wight, after an interval of almost a century. In other days the boundary extended as far as Cowes, but is different now. The borough records of the previous ceremonies contain several quaint entries, as to music, and ale, bread and cheese, and shoulders of mutton to be purchased for St. Peter at 2s. 6d, a piece. The charter of the Borough goes back to within a century of the time of the advent of William the Conqueror, and it is claimed by the Mayor (Council Wm. Blake) that the revival of the ancient custom is of educational value.

THE ATTENDANCE.

The start was made at 9.30 a.m. in fine weather from the "Polars." Staplers, Newport. The party included the Mayor, the Deputy Mayor (Coun. Mrs. Chandler). Ald. Rugg, Courts. Deacon. Munden, Quinton, Russell, Welch, Dabell, Horan, Wray, Leonard, Mew, Dant, Mitchell, the Town Clerk (Mr. T. Ross Pratt), the Borough Surveyor (Mr. Slater), Mr. L. Jordan. J.P., Mr. H. M. Williams. J.P.. the Rev. F. S. Hill (headmaster, Newport Grammar School), Mr. Gerald Abraham. representing Mr. E. G. Barnes, W. Ouseley (Newport Council School), with boys from the schools.

ACROSS THE RIVER IN BARGE.

Upon a signal from the Mayor, the singing of the National Anthem was led by Mr. J. W. Marshall, then the Mayor led the party on the tour of the bounds. A "bumping stone" inscribed "Boundary of Newport Borough, March 31st, 1927. W. Blake. Mayor." was carried round.

Bellemead and Firlee were circuited, and then the party rossed the River Medina in a barge. Subsequently the bonuudary beaters went to Marl Hill, Carisbrooke, the Mayor's residence. where the Mayoress (Mrs. Blake) and the Misses Blake dispensed hospitality, including cakes and ale.

The revival of the custom was completely successful.

The boundaries of Winchester have recently been extended, and on Thursday of last week the old-time coremony of beating the bounds of the enlarged city was observed in a very interesting fashion. The distance around the city on the line of its extended area is about nine miles and eleven boundary stones were set up at various points, this feature of the being especially fixed on the memories of some of the younger Wintonians present by their being "bumped" on the stones after they were duly laid. Alderman Jone, who laid one of the stones, said the site was historic, as they were then standing literally on the old Roman road, over which eighteen centuries ago passed the auxiliary troops of Rome from Winchester to Old Sarum. By the way, the honour of being "bumped" was not monopolised by the juveniles.
His worship the Mayor himself was "bumped"; so were other grave and dignified City Fathers; so was the Town Clerk; so was the Town Crier; and there were those who, for "bumping" purposes, even laid hands on the Deputy Chief Constable of the County and the Head Constable of the City. We congratulate the Corporation and the citizens of Winchester on the important extension which has been so successfully and jhappily consummated. May enlarged area mean enlarged prosperity for our grand old county capital; and, in the words of the Dean, may peace be within her borders and plenteousness within her homes!

Southampton

Southampton Court Leet. —The annual meeting of this ancient Court was held, according to custom, on Hock Tuesday, when the jury, constables, hayward, &c. were sworn, and the charge read to the jury. The Sheriff then adjourned the Court to last Tuesday, when the jury, with the sheriff, bailiffs, &c. assembled the Town Hall. After waiting some time for the whole of the jury, the Sheriff, who is foreman of the jury, said, in a serious manner, "Gentlemen, the first nuisance I shall request you inspect is at Mr. Wiggley's, in East-street." The jury then proceeded to the Carpenters Arms, of which Mr. Wiggley is the landlord, and found a substantial lunch, consisting of cold meat, shell-fish, salad, Ac. which was laid on the table in a style alike creditable to the Sheriff and the landlord. A few toasts having been drunk in some excellent sherry, such as "The Lords of the Leet," (which are the Mayor and Corporation of the town) "The Bailiffs", "and The Sheriff," the jury proceeded to business. The first encroachment to which their attention was directed was in Albion-place, where a plot of ground adjoining the Town Wall has been enclosed, thus shutting the public from view of the beautiful estuary of Southampton Water, and the wooded scenery of the New Forest and surrounding villages. They then proceeded down the recently erected steps to the Town Wall and Tower, at the bottom of Orchardstreet. They there noticed an unsightly wooden shed erected against the ancient wall, and some broken palings, enclosing a plot of ground, on which cabbages were growing and fowls feeding. Their attention was then directed to a stone wall, erected some years ago, opposite the new Baths, which was encroachment on the Shoreroad. After proceeding to Acorn Bridge, and then through Water House-lane, they bent their steps to Northam. On inquiring at Messrs. Summers and Day's large iron ship building factory for the ancient foot-path on the banks of the Itchen, they were politely allowed to over the factory. The extent of the work-shops and powerful steam machinery greatly astonished and amused the jury. They then proceeded along the ancient footpaths which formerly extended from Northam Bridge to Cross House, till they were obstructed by Mr. Elliott's slate vard, when they were obliged to turn out from the banks of the Itchen through Melbourne street to the Gas Works, and then through the newly laid out public Park home. The impression was thus strongly made on the minds of the jury that it was by no means a useless ceremony to beat the bounds of the town, and particularly that it was the duty of the jury to present all encroach, ments on public paths, which would have saved to the town many thousands of pounds and much valuable property. The claim lately set up the Lords of the Admiralty to the mud lands must have been materially affected by the ancient custom of going round a boat moored off the Cross House at Itchen Ferry, which was highly amusing when the tide was up, as the colts had to wade up to their knees in water. The jury will make their presentments next week.

Southampton

In accordance with ancient annual custom, the minister of each parish, followed by the parochial officers and other inhabitants, and the boys of the parochial school, headed by their schoolmaster, proceeded to the different boundaries, marking the divisions of the several parishes, the several marks of division, or "bound,," being struck by the boys with the peeled willow wands they carried with them for the purpose, this ceremony being called "beating the bounds," the object bring more especially to impress upon the rising generations the land marks of the several parishes. Services in connection with the festivals were also held in the churches of Southampton and neighbourhood.

A Custom.— The old-fashioned custom of "beating the bounds" was observed day or two ago in the parish of Waddeson, in Bucks, in manner which will, we understand, result in legal proceedings. A party, as usual, perambulated the boundary the parish, stopping at all the important points of junction. At these places they caught some unlucky individual, and if the boundary line was marked by a wall or a tree the aforesaid individual was "bumped" against it thrice. If there was nothing the kind, then his head was placed in a hole cut in the turf, sundry slaps being at the same time administered to another part his person; but his wounds were modified the application of certain horns of ale from a bottle carried for these and other persons. On the occasion referred to the party so dar forgot themselves as to endeavour to remove a clergyman from his carriage, and to practise this horse play upon him. The parties excuse themselves the belief that ou such occasions they are empowered to operate upon whomsoever they please, and that, to use their own expression, "no law will touch them." If, however, legal proceedings are taken, they will be disabused of this belief.

SIR CHAS. DILK ON UNREFORMED CORPORATIONS IN THE ISLE OF WIGHT

Sir Chas. Dilke directed attention to the question of the unreformed municipal corporations of England, with special reference to those of Sussex, Isle of Wight, and Cornwall, and he asked the Attorney-General what was the legal position of those bodies in the matter of their property, and moved that it would be desirable to forthwith abolish all criminal jurisdiction exercised by unreformed municipal corporations or their officers, with the exception of that of the City of London, for which due provision had been made by statute. Referring to the cases of Brading and Yarmouth, he said in Brading the only visible signs of a corporation were the town hall and the stocks. The hall was one of the smallest he had ever seen, being only 8 feet by 10 feet. The court leet consisted of twelve jurymen, who were summoned as the creatures of the corporation, and were sworn to disclose nothing that might take place at their meetings. The corporation of Brading in 1835 returned their income at the utterly ridiculous sum of £6 17s. 11d., and he himself could prove that it was more than ten times that amount. The corporation of Yarmouth was a larger and more important one. In 1535 the commissioners stated that their accounts were not audited or published, and they returned their property as only £30 a year. He could prove that it was £180 from one source alone, and there were great expectations of future increase. They had been able in the Yar Bridge Bill to smuggle a clause through the house which continued these shipping dues for ever, and which enabled them to sell them for a much larger sum than they would otherwise have been able to do. They had a great suit as to their legal right to levy quayage dues, but with great diplomatic tact they elected the two gentlemen who were contesting their right — Mr. Blake and Mr. Begges — members of the corporation (a laugh). After the information required had been given, Sir Charles agreed to withdraw his motion.

The Court Leet of Brading, after an existence of some hundreds of years, was finally abolished, aud the little town is now governed under a scheme of the Charity Commissioners by Trustees. The scheme did not seem to work very well at first, for they were obliged to have two meeting before they could decide as to who were elected on the Board of Trustees, and even then it was said the second meeting might have been upset on legal grounds. The Vicar (the Rev. E. Summers) gave the members of the old Court Leet a dinner to commemorate their final collapse, and a sort of *requiem*, composed for the occasion, was sorrowfully sung.
