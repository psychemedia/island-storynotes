BOROUGH SESSIONS, MONDAY.—Before the Mayor, E. Way and R. M. Wavell, Esqrs.—Corporal Kimber, of the Isle of Wight Artillery Militia, now stationed at Sandown Fort, was charged with having assaulted Elizabeth Dove, the landlady of the White Horse, in Nodehill, because she interfered to prevent a fight between him and a stranger, whom he had knocked down because the man had challenged him to dance. Defendant denied the charge, and on being fined 17s. 6d. he refused to pay it, and was committed for one month. Captain Manners came forward, and said that as the prisoner bore a very good character in the regiment he would pay the money for him—an offer which restored him to liberty.

WIFE AND SIX CHILDREN MURDERED BY A MADMAN AT SANDOWN.

The little village of Sandown has been thrown into a state of the utmost consternation by a horrible tragedy which has taken place at the fort in that neighbourhood. The villagers "with white lips" stand at the corners of the streets deploring the untimely end of a mother and six children who have or all been murdered in cold blood by a maniac husband  and father, and it is even said by one authority, though with what truth we cannot say, that the stout-hearted soldiers of the fort had deserted their quarters for other and more congenial dwelling places.

The dreadful affair would appear to have taken place some time during the night of Thursday, probably early on Friday morning, but nothing was known of it until a short time after noon on Friday. At about that time Sergeant Whitworth, the master-gunner in charge of the Fort, was observed by a coast-guardsman on duty in one of the lanes adjacent to the Fort, walking towards the parade ground, with his hand to his neck. He enquired he what was the matter with it, and received for reply that it was nothing — only a scratch. He further told the Coastguardsman that during the night a man or men had got in down the chimney, and had shot his wife and children, with a pistol. As Whitworth's conduct had been recently somewhat strange, and had been generally noticed by his neighbours as not quite consistent with soundness of intellect, the Coastguardsman took no notice of the observation and passed on; the sergeant went in the direction of the fort. Shortly afterwards,i consequence of the unfortunate maniac's assertion with respect to the men coming down the chimney and murdering his wife and children, two non-commissioned officers went to his house, which is situated within the precincts of the fort, and an entrance having been effected, a most dreadful scene presented itself. The wife of the gunner and the whole of his children had been deliberately murdered, their throats having been cut with a razor. On making the horrible discovery, the non-commissioned officers, leaving the place undisturbed, immediately communicated with the police, and they shortly afterwards proceeded to the spot. They found the floor of the house saturated with blood, and the odour which arose from its commencing decomposition gave rise to the remark that it smelt like a slaughter-house. At the foot of the bed was found lying Mrs. Harris, partly undressed, with her youngest babe in her arms. On her right hand lay another child, and at the foot of the bed a third, the ages of the three being respectively about four months, four or five years, and 11 or 12 years. The whole of these had their throats cut, and were lying in a pool of coagulated blood. On a second bed were found the other three children in a similar condition. One of these was about I8 months old, the others were the two eldest. The whole of the bodies were quite cold, and their condition, as well as the state of the blood around them, showed that the dreadful deed must have been committed some hours previously.

The unfortunate maniac, for it was evident that he could receive no other designation, as, although no thought was entertained of his being capable of committing such a deed, his manner had been for sone time previously remarked as strange, appears, after destroying the lives of his wife and children to have made an attempt upon his own. The wound he inflicted upon himself was, however, very slight, and he will soon recover from its effects. He was taken into custody as soon as the fact of the murders was made known, and he gave into the hands of one of the sergeants of the fort a letter from himself addressed to the adjutant. He is stated to be about the age of 35, and to have belonged to Leeds, and amongst other rumours as to the cause of his insanity, is one alleging that complaints having been made to head-quarters respecting him, and that his removal from his position was imminent. His accounts appear to have been accurately kept, and have found to balance correctly. He had no pecuniary embarrassments, and his wife was a woman much esteemed about the fort, and was considered to have made the miserable man's home comfortable, and, so far as was in her power, happy. The children are stated to have been well-behaved.

It is stated that since Whitworth has been at the hospital he has confessed having murdered his wife and six children, and also that it was his intention to have blown up the fort, but that having lost the key he was unable to do so. Had he been enabled to carry out his intention the consequences might have been very serious, as the village itself might have suffered.

An inquest is being held to-day on the body of the murdered woman and children.

Shocking Murder of a Wife and Children at Sandown.

...

The board guardians of the Newport Union were applied to by the police to bury the bodies. The *Morning Post* says, "They sent over seven boxes— scarcely to be designated coffins— into which the gory remains of the unfortunate sufferers were indecently forced by some of the pauper officials soon after their arrival. There was not the slightest attempt made to perform any of the usual cleanly offices; and some of the c coffins not being large enough, the bodies were actually crushed into their narrow prisons, with most sacrilegious indecency, and without the smallest article of funeral clothing upon them. The lids of the coffins were merely secured by a few common nails, and in this condition the whole seven were huddled together in a kind of taxed cart, and sent over at one o'clock to Brading Church for interment. So deficient were all the arrangements, that but for the volunteer service of a small party of men belonging to the Isle of Wight Militia Artillery, who had come over to Brading from feelings of curiosity, the bodies could not have been removed into the church. Their aid having been accepted, the coffins were deposited in the centre aisle, where they presented oneof the most painful exhibitions that can be imagined. The service was read by the vicar, the Rev. Isidore Heath. The church was densely crowded, but neither relative nor friend of the deceased's family was present. The interment took place in a square grave, scarcely three feet deep—in king with the indecency marking all the arrangements of the funeral. It is a disagreeable duty to allude to the short-comings of any public body, but in this case silence would be inexcusable on the part of the reporter, who was an eyewitness of the painful facts he has endeavoured to describe."

THE MURDERS AT SANDOWN.

The frightful series of murders perpetrated at the little village of Sandown (Isle of Wight) during the night of Thursday week were briefly alluded to in our impression of Saturday last. Fuller information is now supplied. Mr. Wm. Blake held an inquest on the dead bodies on Saturday, when the circumstances were testified to numerous witnesses:—

Whitworth, a sergeant, and the master gunner in charge of the Fort, was observed on Friday, at about noon, walking towards the parade-ground, with his hand to his neck. He was asked what was the matter with it, and he replied that it was nothing—only a scratch. He further told the coastguardsman that during the night a man or men had got down the chimney, and had shot his wife and children with a pistol. As Whitworth's conduct had been recently somewhat strange, and had been generally noticed by his neighbours as not quite consistent with soundness of intellect, the coast-guardsman took no notice of the observation and passed on; the sergeant went in the direction of the Fort. Shortly afterwards, in consequence of the unfortunate maniac's assertion with respect to the men coming down the chimney and murdering his wife and children, two noncommissioned officers went to his house, which is situated within the precincts of the Fort, and an entrance having been effected, a most dreadful scene presented itself. The wife of the gunner and the whole of his children had been deliberately murdered, their throats having been cut with a razor. Rousing the police they examined the place more closely. At the foot of the bed Mrs. Whitworth was lying partly undressed, with her baby in her arms. On her right band lay another child, and at the foot of the bed a third, the ages of the three being respectively about four months, four or five years, and eleven or twelve years. The whole of these had their throats cut, and were lying a pool of coagulated blood. second bed were found the other three children in a similar condition. One of these was about 18 months old the others were the two eldest. The whole of the bodies were quite cold, and their condition, as well as the state of the blood around them, showed that the dreadful deed must have been committed some hours previously.

The wretched madman, for it is evident that he was insane, appears, after destroying the lives of his children, to have made attempt upon his own. The wound he inflicted upon himself was, however, very slight, and he will soon recover from its effects. He is now in custody, and has confessed having murdered his wife and children, and also that it was bis intention to have blown up the fort, but that, having lost the key, he was unable do so.

These are the main facts of the story which was elicited by degrees at the inquest held on the bodies on Saturday. At this inquest, Capt. Manners, of the Isle of Wight Militia Artillery, deposed—I was on the barrack parade-ground yesterday, about two p.m. when I saw Whitworth coming running across it in great excitement. Capt. Robinson was a few paces in front, and Whitworth threw himself on his knees before him, and holding his hands exclaimed, "For God'a sake. Sir, save me!" He then gave Capt. Robinson his watch, an envelope with some papers, and some money, and said, "He's used me dreadfully; he's held pistol at my head, and swore he'd shoot me if I didn't cut my throat;" pulling down at the same time the collar of his coat and showing his throat covered with blood. He then added, "There's awful work down there, pray go down." He was sent to the hospital, walking there himself. Some one then present on the parade said, "He has murdered his family," and I then immediately ran down to the fort.

A paper was found in the room where the shocking tragedy was perpetrated. It was in Whitworth's handwriting, and ran as follows, the blanks representing blood marks:—

Sandown Fort, 1860, 17 May, 1860.  
Infern plot ----- murdered ----- Sergeant Whitworth's wife ----- and six children. ----- Lieut. ————, R.E.  
Dr. ——— the rascall under a cloak as a friend. ----- Shocking work -----Captain ----- Corporal ——— Captain ———

The verdict was one of wilful murder against Sergeant Whitworth, accompanied by an expression of opinion that at the time the murder was committed he was of unsound mind. The prisoner's insanity was clearly established. It appears extraordinary that in so short a space of time seven human beings should have been murdered without any alarm having been given. Nothing was stated in the evidence with reference to the magazine, nor to anything which the prisoner was reported to have said at the hospital, but the village of Sandown is full of all kinds of startling rumours. The key of the magazine was found in the room with the bodies. It would appear that the children were all driven into one room, there murdered on the floor, and afterwards thrown upon the beds.

The Board of Guardians of the Newport Union were applied to by the police to bury the bodies. The Morning Post says,—“ They sent over seven boxes—scarcely to be designated coffins—into which the gory remains of the unfortunate sufferers were indecently forced by some of the pauper officials soon after their arrival. There was not the slightest attempt made to perform any of the usual cleanly offices; and some of the coffins not being large enough, the bodies were actually crushed into their narrow prisons, with most sacriligeous indecency, and without the smallest article of funeral clothing upon them. The lids of the coffins were merely secured by a few common nails, and in this condition the whole seven were huddled together in a kind of taxed cart, and sent over one o'clock to Brading Church for interment. deficient were all the arrangements, that but for the volunteer service of a small party of men belonging to the Isle of Wight Militia Artillery, who had come over to from feelings of curiosity, the bodies could not have been removed into the church. Their aid having been accepted, the coffins were deposited in the centre aisle, where they presented one of the most painful exhibitions that can be imagined. The service was read by the vicar, the Rev. Isidore Heath. The church was densely crowded, but neither relative nor friend of the deceased's family was present. The interment took place in a square grave, scarcely three feet deep—in keeping with the indecency marking all the arrangements of the funeral. It is disagreeable duty allude to the short-comings of a public body, but in this case silence would be inexcusable on the part of the reporter, who was an eye-witness of the painful facts he has endeavoured to describe."

Isle of Wight Observer - Saturday 26 May 1860

HORRIBLE MURDER OF A WIFE AND SIX CHILDREN AT SANDOWN.

If there be one thing more than another which calls for further observation on this melancholy affair from a "Free Press," it is the revolting and inhuman manner in which the bodies were "boxed up" into cases, yclept parish coffins. Into such receptacles the gory remains of the maniac's victims were indecently forced in, and then nailed up; the coffin of the mother being blackened over, and those of the innocents whitewashed. Not the slightest attempt was made to perform any of the usual cleanly offices; and some of the coffins not being large enough, the mutilated remains were actually crushed into their narrow tenements with disgraceful indecency, and without the smallest article of funereal clothing upon them. They were then hurriedly packed into the cart belonging the Isle of Wight House of Industry, and thus conveyed to the Church gate without any other mourners than the multitude. Nor do we learn that any post mortem examination was made to ascertain the extent of injuries the victims may have received, beyond the mere inspection of the bodies as they were found laying in their gory beds. There can nothing, therefore, to deny or confirm one of the thousand rumours which waf circulation, that two of the bodies had been run through with the sword. An eye-witness of the spectacle, previous to the inquest, accords with us that it would appear impossible that these unparalleled murders could have been committed in silence; as it was evident from the imprints of the feet of the eldest child, also, apparently, those of a smaller one, were distinctly visible at the foot of the staircase and in the rooms below, where, no doubt, they had run down stairs and attempted to escape from their maniacal parent; and by him again taken up stairs to be sacrificed with their mother, brothers, and sisters. Were there no cries for help? We, therefore, repeat that it is impossible to credit that quietude prevailed in the house while such deeds were being committed; and the more extraordinary still, that, as has been deposed by the witnesses, no noise was heard in the fort, even by the occupants of the adjoining tenements. This renders the mystery more mysterious. We would not for moment be thought to throw a censure on the inmates of the fort; but the public do not think it right for the general safety that the keys of one of Her Majesty's fortifications should be confided to the custody and care of an officer's servant, with orders that no inmate should have ingress or egress to the fort, after tattoo roll, but the officers themselves: and then an admission obtained with no other "countersign" than that of "kicking at the door." This may be all very well — it may be part and parcel of the red-tape system of the circumlocution office. But here is a fort—one of the many forts built by Henry VIII. for the protection of the coast, in which there is a magazine— the key of  which, as it appeared evidence, has been solely in the care of a maniac, who, had it not been for the providential act of having accidentally dropped the same, might have rendered the tragedy still more appalling to the whole village, and Her Majesty's lieges therein.

Since writing the above few observations, we have again calmly perused the evidence given at the inquest, and have drawn a few inferences therefrom. It is admitted by the testimony of Mrs. Eastley that "the master gunner was strange in his manner;" yet it would appear that no further notice was taken of the same. How is that he was not watched? "No smoke had been seen to come from the chimney for two days previous to the tragedy, and the window blinds were down the whole of Thursday," yet no neighbour made enquiry as to the condition of the inmates. This evidence was also confirmed by Bevis, the servant. Another report in the village was that the eldest girl had stated that she was afraid to go home, yet the party to whom she had spoken was not produced. Captain Manners, who had only known Whitworth about three weeks, said, "he appeared be a very odd man, and had stated to him that he had in his possession that which would transport some of the colonels or generals of Engineers," to which the foreman of the jury inquired whether such language was not contrary to military discipline? Yet, all seems to have passed unnoticed, beyond "that he was odd and strange his manner." We are here forcibly reminded of the old adage of "a stitch in time saves nine;" and if notice had been taken of the expressions and demeanour of the man, a proper vigilance would have been exercised over him, and the fatal result might have been averted. However, from the testimony before us, as also that obtained since the inquest, the precise facts and date of the occurrence in all probability will never be cleared up. During the confinement of Whitworth in the hospital, we learn that nothing has been gleaned from him beyond a few rambling and incoherent expressions, and it is evident that was laboring under some delusion, referred to in  the paper which was picked up. The night before his removal to Winchester appears to have been the same; he slept not, and when a reference was made to him of the affair, he appears to have stated "that that old ——— was standing in the corner of the room with a slouched hat on, with a loaded pistol in his hand, and said, if you don't cut all their throats directly, I will shoot you, and I will not long about it. I had been watching some two or three nights, and there had been a nasty disagreeable smell down the chimney, and I had set up to watch it, and I had got my wife to watch too." This latest circumstance leads us to infer that from the position in which the wife was found, lying on the edge or side of the bed with all her clothes on, excepting her boots, that the woman had suspicions of him and endeavoured to relieve his impressions by watching, as stated by him; but probably worn out, with fatigue form the want of rest, had laid down and there fallen asleep  to wake no more.

REMOVAL OF THE PRISONER.

On Tuesday morning the prisoner, William Henry Whitworth, being sufficiently recovered from his wounds to enable him to be removed, was taken from the hospital, at Sandown, and placed in a fly under charge of the constables, Ingram and Edson, and conveyed to Winchester gaol. He appears to have been in a very feeble state. On his arrival at Ryde he was placed in a Bath chair and conveyed along the pier and put on board the steam packet for Portsmouth—thence conveyed to Winchester; every precaution having been taken for his safety during his removal by his being handcuffed. He has been committed to Winchester assizes tor trial under the Coroner's warrant, it not having been thought necessary to have any farther hearing in the matter.

The following appeared in our second edition of Saturday last:—

In this Island an event has occurred which has, within few hours, cast gloom over every household within it. In the records of our police courts we have been accustomed to pride ourselves in the absence of great crimes; and it has not been our misfortune to have our soil stained with blood, even by a maniac's hand, within the remembrance of any man living. The event which occurred yesterday at Sandown is one which will be long remembered in the Island; and, in fact, the short chapter of horrors which we now lay before our readers has but few parallels.  

Yesterday, about 2 o'clock in the afternoon, Sergeant Whitworth, a gunner at Sandown Fort, was seen by the Coastguardsman on duty walking towards the parade ground with his hand to his neck; and the Coastguardsman naturally inquired what was the matter with his neck, to which Whitworth replied, "I have got a scratch there; but," he continued, "some one has got down the chimney in my house, and murdered my wife and children." Of this the Coastguardsman does not appear to have taken much notice, and the wretched man proceeded to the parade ground, when it was found that he had inflicted a severe injury on himself; and he again repeated the story of the man descending the chimney and murdering his children. He at the same time gave to Sergeant Dash, of the Isle of Wight Militia, a letter and the key of his house. The contents of the letter are not yet generally known. Sergeant Dash and his corporal once proceeded to the residence of Whitworth, one of the houses in the fort, and to their horror found that the man's wife and six children had all been deliberately murdered. Ascertaining this awful fact, the sergeant considered it his duty not to interfere with the bodies, but to leave them in the position they were. The police authorities were at once communicated with, and the sergeant was sent over to Portsmouth to apprise the military authorities there of the crime that had been committed within the precincts of the fort.

Yesterday afternoon the police entered the house, the floor of which they found be literally saturated with blood; in fact, as one of the policemen remarked, it smelt more like a slaughterhouse than anything else. The appearance of the house would seem to indicate that the wretched man had possessed a good wife, who had striven hard to make for him and his children as comfortable a home as their humble means would allow. At the foot of the bed the mother and her infant child were found lying dead with their throats cut. The poor woman was dressed, and had evidently had a struggle with her murderer. The child, which could not have been more than four months old, was lying across the mother's breast. On the right hand of the mother lay a child apparently about four or five years of age, and at the foot of the bed another about eleven or twelve, both with their throats cut. On the second bed, in the centre of the room, there lay, as if asleep, another dear child, apparently about 18 months old; the throat of this child wss cut, but the wound was so low down, that it was not apparent to the looker-on. At the head of the same bed were the two eldest children, lying side by side. All the children were in their bed dresses, and there is no doubt but the murders were committed shortly after the mother had dressed herself, and that the wretched murderer intended to commit self-destruction.

The letter Whitworth addressed to the adjutant will be produced to-day before the coroner, and may throw some additional light on this tragedy, respecting which all sorts of rumours are afloat. It is said that Whitworth was an exceedingly sullen man, and was not much liked, and that complaints had been sent to headquarters, in consequence of which he was about to be removed—that he considered this a degradation, and has allowed it to prey upon his mind for some weeks. One of his children is said to have expressed fear of going home, as her father had threatened to murder her.

Whitworth's books have been examined and found to correct, and it is evident that no pecuniary embarrassment led to the commission of this dreadful act. His age is stated to be 35, and he is a Leeds man. Amongst other rumours it is said that since Whitworth has been in the hospital he has made a confession, not merely of the murders, but of his intention to blow up the fort, and that he would have done so, but he had lost the key of the magazine. It very evident that a man with his mind in a state that enabled him to murder his wife and children would have been equally aa capable of doing the act we have just referred to; and as there is vast quantity of gunpowder at Sandown, it is not improbable that the inhabitants there may have providentially escaped a greater calamity than even the one it has been our painful duty to record.

On further inquiry we have found that Whitworth, although acting as a sergeant of the Royal Artillery at Sandown, had not in reality attained that rank; and it is therefore more than probable that the prospect of being reduced preyed upon the mind of the wretched man.

The poor people of Sandown, unaccustomed to such dreadful deeds, are in a sad state; sorrow is depicted upon the countenance of every individual seen in the streets. The fort is completely forsaken, no one caring to remain there, after the commission of such crimes. The murderer lies in the hospital, and it is much queationed whether he will ever recover from the effects of the wound he inflicted on himself. The murdered woman is spoken of as an exemplary wife and mother, and the children as well behaved and intelligent beyond their years. A coroner's inquest will be held this day.

The following appeared in our third edition of Monday last:—

The above particulars will be found substantiated, in almost every respect, by the following depositions taken before the coroner. There are a few minor circumstances connected with the case, to which it may be as well to refer, as no mentaon was made of them at the inquest. A wedged piece of wood was found in the house which had evidently been used to secure the door, and which in all probability prevented one or more of the children from making their escape; and on a further examination of one body it became painfully evident from the expression of its countenance that its death must have been far more agonising than that of the others. That Whitworth intended to blow ap the magazine there can be no doubt; and the rumour that one of the children had expressed dread of the father has been confirmed but not at the inquest.

THE INQUEST.

The jury assembled in the mess room of the officer's house in the fort at 1 o'clock p.m. of Saturday; and, after being worn in, proceeded to view the body. The Rev. Charles Bury, of Sandown, was the foreman of the jury.

John Dash, staff sergeant in the Isle of Wight Artillery, stationed at Sandown, in answer to questions from the Coroner, deposed that he had seen the bodies now seen by the jury. Identified the woman the wife of Sergeant Whitworth, master gunner in Royal Artillery, also their two elder girls, but did not know the other children. Last saw the mother at 11 o'clock on Tuesday morning, at the door. They had six children here and one away. There were three boys and three girls here. They lived in the fort and occupied a tenement therein. He had known Sergeant Whitworth since last July. He had no opportunity of seeing on what terms he lived with his wife. Never saw them together. Was talking with him on Tuesday. Saw nothing in particular in his manner. Conversation was as usual, talking about drill and guns. Witness was aware Sergeant Whitworth was ordered away. About twenty minutes past 2 of yesterday afternoon (Friday) witness was on the barrack parade at Sandown, and saw Sergeant Whitworth coming towards the parade. He was then near the Star and Garter hotel. He seemed very hurried, and almost staggered as he walked across the parade towards the officers' quarters. Several officers were standing on the steps at their doors. Whitworth went up to Captain Robinson, of the Isle of Wight Artillery, and kneeled down before him: heard him talk in a very excited manner, putting both hands together up to his throat. He saw him take some papers from his breast pocket and and give them to Captain Robinson. He then went with the officers to their quarters; he then was taken to the hospital in his (witness's) presence. Saw his face and hands covered with blood He. had an overcoat on closely buttoned up to the chin. Could not see his throat. By direction of Captain Worsley, witness proceeded to the fort to see about his (Whitworth's) wife and children. I ran to the house. Saw Corporal Eastley of the R.E. standing outside of the pailings of Whitworth's house in the court yard. I went in first, saw one of the Coastguards (Hoar) and asked what was the matter. I asked him if he knew how Whitworth's family were. I went in and saw footmarks of blood in both the lower rooms and [?] similar marks on the stairs. I went up stairs and found the windows closed and the right side of shutter

TO DO open six inches. I opened the shutters, and the first thing I saw was an old sword lying almost in the centre of the room, and lots of papers and pools of blood around them. There were two bedsteads in the room. After opening the shutters, my attention was drawn to the woman on one of the beds. I found there the body of Mrs. Whitworth and three children. In the other bed was the eldest girl and another girl, and a boy about two years of age. I saw the throats of all them were cut. They were all dead, cold, and stiff. The mother was dressed, but had not her boots or cap on. All the children were in their night dresses, with their socks on, except the eldest girl, who had her stockings on. All were more or less covered with bed clothes, Mrs. Whitworth more than the rest. There was a great quantity of blood on the bed, and the pillows were particularly soaked. The eldest girl had much blood on her stockings, as if she had walked in it. My opinion is that the bodies had more the appearance of lying asleep in bed rather than having been placed there afterwards. I found an open razor lying on the floor, almost close to the sword, about 18 inches or two feet from the bed where Mrs. Whitworth was lying. I afterwards went down stairs in company with the police and found another razor in case. As soon as I got into the house I called out of the window, and William Corney, corporal, and a gunner came, also a Coastguardman, and they followed me up. Saw blood on the walls and bed posts as if it had spirted there, and one large spot on the window shelf. The policeman took charge of the sword and razor. There were marks of blood on door jam and latch, and footstep marks of blood downstairs — one naked foot, much larger in print, and another smaller foot. As far as I could judge, it was that of the second girl. I did not see Whitworth again until about 7 o'clock last evening, he was then lying in bed at the hospital. I merely looked through the door, and heard him ask one of the men who was watching him, what he was doing there? He told him he was keeping him company. Soon after I heard him say "Poor little Bobby is gone." Whitworth spoke of his children. He said, the eldest is Ellen; there's Lizzy, Molly, Teddy, Willy, and Bobby. The man asked him how old they were. He said the eldest was 12, and youngest 12 months. After this, he was continually talking to himself in a rambling way. I found in the room where the dead bodies were, a large key attached to several smaller keys, which were covered with papers. The other tenements are occupied by Corporal Eastley and family, across the way, and officers of the Isle of Wight Artillery quartered there. The sword was covered with blood, but not as if it had been used. The razor appeared to have been used. It was covered with blood, and its edge was turned.

Emma Jane, wife of Corporal William Eastley, of Engineers, stationed at the fort, said—We came into fort last Thursday week. Our quarters are nearly opposite—the other side of the court yard. We were in the fort in December last; think we were here 10 weeks. Sergeant Whitworth was there then. His christian name is William Henry. Had identified the body of Mrs. Whitworth and the faces of all the children of Sergeant Whitworth. Eldest was always called Molly, and the second was called Elisabeth, but she did not know the names of the others than as William, Robert, and Frederick. Don't know which was which. Never heard a word between them—always very quiet. Last time she saw Sergeant Whitworth was on Thursday afternoon, about 2 p.m. Saw him come out of the house and walk to the gate. Not seen him since. Last saw Mrs. Whitworth the previous evening of Wednesday. I saw a light in the bedroom, where the bodies now are, on Wednesday evening. Never seen any smoke from the house since. Saw all the children on Wednesday evening looking through the window downstairs. The baby was in its mother's arms. Saw the second girl (Elizabeth) about 10 on Thursday morning. She had her bonnet and shawl on, and went out of the fort gate. Did not see her return, nor any of the other children. When I got up on Thursday morning I found something like soapsuds mixed with water in the cistern in the court yard. I remarked upon it, and found they (the children) did not come after that. The blinds of the bedroom were down the whole of Thursday. They did not appear to have been moved. On Friday morning (yesterday) observed the shutters closed. Yesterday afternoon, at a quarter to 2, as my husband and I were standing at our window we saw a small portion of the shutters slightly opened in Whitworth's house, and called attention to the same, and said, "they are moving." Never saw any one come out of the house. Last Wednesday a razor-grinder came to the fort. I don't know name. He came from Newport. I saw him at the door of Whitworth's house. I took across my scissors to be ground, and the man had a razor with a white handle in his hand setting it; rubbing it on stone. (In answer to questions from coroner and jury on this subject, witness repeated the circumstance, and continued.) Saw the man take the razor into Whitworth's house. Saw it was a razor of the description as that produced. Don't think all the children slept in the same room, as I had seen some of the children at the other room in their night clothes. Whitworth is generally a strange man in his manner. When he came out on Thursday I observed that his trowsers were not pulled down over his boots. We (husband and I) went to bed a little before 10 on Thursday evening. We remarked that there had been no light the whole of the evening. We had very little intercourse with them. It seemed strange to me not to have seen anything of them (the family) on Thursday afternoon. He (Whitworth) came out on Thursday in a hurried manner. There is a back way out of his house on to the ramparts, but there is no way out of the fort but through the large gate. [This witness gave her evidence in a clear and intelligible manner.]

Capt. William Whichcote Manners deposed that he has charge of the fort. Has known Whitworth since I have been here—three weeks. 

TO DO 

 He appeared to be an odd man—he always seems to have had some grievances against some one or the other, particularly the engineers. He said he had forged documents in his possession which would transport some of the Generals and Colonels. was very anxious to remain here (in the fort), and he said he had eight or nine months to serve to complete his term of service for pension. I saw him last in the fort on Wednesday or Thursday. He passed my window. I was on barrack parade yesterday about quarter-past 2. When he came there we were going to fall in. I saw this man running along in excited state. Capt. Robinson was few paces in front me, and Whitworth came up to him, fell to his knees, threw up his hands imploringly and said, "for God's sake preserve me, or save me." put his^an(fin htt W-eastand"handed Robertson nia watch and an envelope with papers and money; did not see how much. He then said, "he has used me shamefully; he held a pistol at my head, and swore would shoot me I did not cut my throat;" and at the same time pulled down the collar of his coat. At all events could see it was bloody. He then pushed his way into the barracks, and was then sent to the hospital. Somebody who was present, said "no doubt he has murdered the whole family." It struck me it might so, and I came down to the fort and found Sergeant Dash and some one else outside of the fort door Whit worth'a house. Dash told witness it was an awful business, and I went into the house and then upstairs. Saw a woman and three children in one bed and three children in the other. Their countenances appeared quite placid; the woman's left hand hanging over the bed side. I noticed her wedding ring. I had seen her once. I returned to barracks, and the doctors were just washing his throat and putting on the it was cut on both sides. In the evening Whitworth ssidat the hospital, she was a good wife, or woman; that he had nursed her and she nursed him, and named the children and they him; and then went off in rambling talk. then began to talk about tome ships coming and attacking the fort; and wanted to know whether the fort was to be condemned. When he feat came into the barracks, on his knees, said "There has been awful work down there," and prayed that some would down—meaning to the fort, and from that some one said had murdered his family. And when in the hospital asked for cold bandage, and then alluded to his poor wife; she had, he said, "put many bandage on his forehead —she was a good woman." Doctor asked him if he was comfortable. Occupiers of the fort are myself, Lieut. Puckle, Lieut. Brigstocke, three officers' servants, Corporal Bastley and family, Whitworth and family. My orders the gate of the fort are that it to be at tattoo Toll call, half-past •. The key are left with the servants till the officers come in. No person can go in or out without the servants' knowledge. On Thursday evening left the Star and Garter hotel, where Sad been dining. About half-past 101 found the door of the fort shut, and after calling once of twice and kicking at the door, servant came. I asked him Mr. was in; said Tea. said that Ike door, then, and (6 bed.

I saw Corporal Eastley outside the fort. asked him if had seen the gunner? He said, "Yes, has just passed up I then went with the corporal into the fort, into his quarters, and asked him where the gunner's quarters where. I went to it, the door was closed, but not locked. I went inside and looked round the lower room. Saw tracks of blood on the floor, and also on the stairs. I then went out to give the alarm. I met Serjeant Dash and two his comrades. I told him what had seen, and then went upstairs. Found the bodies in the same state scribed by Serjeant Dash. I have heard his evidence. The Whitworths are strangers to me. George Bevis, officer's servant.—Is a private in Royal Artillery, occupying premises adjoining. There is internal communication between our quarters, have seen all the bodies! they are those of Sergeant Whit* worth's wife and six children. I saw him last Thursday afternoon, about 3 o'clock, at his own quarters* He went across the square on to the ramparts. spoke to him. I said the weather was clearing up now. made observations about the weather, and that's all of the conversation. About ten minutes afterwards, Raw the second girl; she came into the fort, and then went to her house. Witness said he had charge of the gate and had the key. It was closed at half-past 9 of an evening. During the night never heard any noise from Whitworth's quarters. When I shut the gate half-past 9 that evening, I saw a light downstairs, just at the corner of the blind. When went to let the officers in there was no light there. Cross-questioned to seeing any one go out come into Whitworth fi \jumrters.—He said he saw no one. His fellow servants were James Chatfield and Racket. All of them went to bed together on Thursday night. About 11 o'clock, I was talking with my fellow servants in consequence of not hearing of Whitworth's family, I said, I have good mind to and knock at the house and asked for something to see if they were up. "I should not wonder," said I, "that the master man had made away with himself and his family," because we had seen nothing of them. The jury asked why he said so, witness said, in joke, it came up in my mind at the moment; and I thought nothing more of it until I saw Whitworth come on the barrack ground. Never knew him stop out all night. James H.C. No. 38, said, —When I was duty yesterday afternoon at Sandown, about half-past 2, I heard of the occurrence. I saw Serjeant Dash. gave me a key the house. I went in and found tl\a house in the state described. I took possession of the sword and razor, which were found on the floor, and the keys altogether. t ' They were all produced. Described the dress of the children as they were. Had never seen Whitworth outside of the fort at night. Robert Henry Leesorr, surgeon, practising at Sandown. —Saw "first between and the barracks hospital. had a very severe cut across his throat, by a somewhat instrument. It may have been by the razor, as its edge is blunt. It was evidently done by his right hand. There were two gashes. There were two incisions; first, merely a scratch; second, a deep cut, but did not separate any very important vessels. He must have lost a considerable quantity of Wood. He muttered several sentences, but I paid no particular notice, only to make him speak to ascertain the extent of injury he had sustained. He seemed quite unconscious of hit actions. He seemed in a state of partial collapse from the extent of the injury sustained. saw him about an hour and a half afterwards still in a state of collapse. I have since seen the bodies now viewed; the woman and the sis children. I found the woman with the windpipe completely severed, together with the large vessels and nerves; length of wound six inches, and both sides of the windpipe severed. Bawne other wounds upon her. Her hands were not cut and signs of resistance. I should say the wound in the mother's throat was done with that razor when asleep. She could hardW have awoke. From the nature of the wound death was likely to ensue in two minutes. Quite sufficient to death, and one minute after it inflicted she would be incapable of resistance. did not feel it to be necessary to make a post mortem examination. The wound seen was sufficient. In the same bed, child two or three years old, the body of a boy in a doubled-up position, not in a natural position, his throat cut from ear ear with an instrument that had lost its edge. By cutting to the bone of the woman, it probably may have jagged the razor. On the same bed a girl of 10 or 11 years old, lying with her head a pillow. Her head was at the opposite end of the bed. Her throat was cut 7or inches—the longest cut any. That was evidently hacked, and all the large vessels separated. It had been cut several times. Also infant male child about 12 months old, a very severe cut across, from side side, behind the angle of the jaw, extending to the condyle; all the large vessels were separated. That child fives one an impression that it had been held up by the hair of its head! and sawed to and fro with such sword. Examined the sword produced. The eldest of the three children on this bed had blood on its naked feet. In the other bed I found the eldest girl, 12 or 13 years of age, lying on her side, leading one to suppose that she had thrown herself on the bed. Very severe cut, separating the windpipe. Throat cut with blunt instrument, either sword or razor, and the instrument more than once drawn across. She had stockings on her feet saturated with blood, and the toes protruding through the stockings. Also saw bloody footmarks corresponding in shape and size with her foot, distinctly shewing the web or fabric of the stocking. On same bed child of about a year or two old. Deep wound in the throat, and probably the first from not being hacked, evidently done when asleep from its placid countenance. The other, girl on same bed 9 or 10 years of age had similar cut of about six inches across the throat. Very jagged wound. Bhe was lying her back, her legs thrown up. In every case the wounds were the cause of death, none of them self-inflicted. Of the footmarks downstairs I observed those of a man's foot, and the conformation it was that of Whitworth's foot. Since he has been in hospital I have examined his foot, and on the ball of left foot there is a bunion. On both feet, on the outer side of each, there is somewhat unnatural protuberance. We also saw the-larger footmarks to correspond with the appearances -described on his feet. Some appear to have been made by naked feet, the imprint of the toes, and some with stockings on. The fabric of stocking taken from Whitworth corresponds, particularly the heel marks, the fibres being peculiar, the. woof of one sort runs in circular direction about the heel and in the other from side to tide. There were other cutlasses the store similar to the one produced, to which could have access. Thomas Fleming, gunner, Isle of Wight Artillery, deposed saw Whitworth when he came into the hospital; undressed himself. Witness here produced the shirt he had pulled off, which was saturated with blood (supposed from his own wounds), also the socks. He took charge of the same, and they were in the same state now produced. His feet were bloody then. Witness washed the feet; there were no wounds on them. saw Whit worth take them off and put them by the side of the bed. I then took charge them.
 
Inspector Campbell, superintendent of the police, produced a paper found on the floor of Whitworth's room that morning, upstairs. The following iS a copy, as far it could be made out. It was written in pencil. A pencil was found on the mantelpiece, and produced.

"Infernal Plot. Sandown Fort, 1860.  
Murdered 17 May, 1860.  
Sergt. Whitworth, wife, and 6 children.  
Lieut. Davis, R.E.  
.......... the Rascall under a cloak as a friend.  
several....... Capt. Regan.  
Shocking Work.  
Corpl. Eastley. Captn. Ogle."

The Coroner read a letter which was found addressed to Captain Rogan, R.A., from Whitworth. It was a request that the captain would forward to the authorities to allow him to remain in the fort nine months longer to complete his term for a pension.

Corporal Eastley, stationed at Sandown fort, said he knew Sergeant Whitworth, the master gunner of the fort. He had seen him write on several occasions. He swore to the handwriting of the letter and paper produced as that of Sergeant Whitworth.

The Coroner, (F. Blake, esq.,) at 7 p.m., summed up and drew the attention of the jury to the evidence, which occupied 40 minutes. The jury then retired, and at 8 p.m. returned and gave the following verdict:— "Wilful murder against William Henry Whitworth of his wife and six children;" and the foreman said, "we wish to add, if we may be allowed to do so, for the sake of our neighbours and the locality, that it is our opinion he was of unsound mind at the time."

The Coroner again assured the rev. foreman and jury that the recommendation would have no effect. They were not assembled to express opinions of sanity or insanity. It would be the duty of the Coroner to issue his warrant and commit Whitworth to Winchester for a jury there to decide that point.

Since the inquest the police have among the papers in the prisoner's room the license from the commanding officer for the marriage; also the marriage certificate and baptismal certificates of the children, the substance of which is as follows:—

Bombardier William Henry Whitworth, 5 company, 3 battalion, Royal Artillery, has permission to marry Martha Beech. D. W. Paynter, Captn.—Kingston, 17 July, 1847.

THE SANDOWN TRAGEDY.

*To the Editor of the Isle of Wight Observer.*

Sir, —I do not at all sympathise with those of your correspondents who wish to perpetuate the remembrance of the awful event that has recently filled every household in the Island with sorrow, by erecting a monument over the remains of the poor murdered creatures, who are now where the "wicked cease from troubling." A bloody leaf is added to the hitherto unsullied history of our Island, and it cannot be effaced; but why disturb the holy feelings which occupy the mind of a visitor when near the grave of "Jane, the Young Cottager," by calling to his or her remembrance that in another grave close by sleep children whom the devil prompted their father to murder? "Poor little Bobby," with his mother, and his brothers and sisters are all gone, and let us pray God that the earth may never be cursed by a similar crime to the one that brought them to their untimely end. Let them rest in peace. To cover them with a stone could not benefit the dead, but would, in my humble opinion, give unnecessary pain to the living.

"The recent Traoeut at Sandown Fort.—The ladies of Sandown are raising a subscription in postage stamps, with a view to erect a monument in commemoration of the poor children who, with their mother, were recently murdered, under such tragical circumstances, at Sandown Fort. This expression of sympathy cannot fail, under the circumstances, to elicit cordial support, proportioned to the horror excited by the recital of the sanguinary occurrence."—*Daily Telegraph*, June 9.

To the Ladies of SANDOWN.

S hall man forbear when woman points the way?  
A sweeter sense than his the fair possess.  
N ot yield the trifle for the murdered clay?  
D are men presume if women choose to bless?  
O wn ye, creation, for 'tis woman's due,—  
W oman's the fountain of the good and true:

THE LATE SANDOWN TRAGEDY, AND THE PROPOSED MONUMENT IN MEMORY OF THE VICTIMS.

*To the Editor of the Isle of Wight Observer.*

Sir, —It was much to be desired that the well-timed remarks of "A Parent," in a recent impression of your paper, should have induced those morbid minds whose sympathies, in common with all others, have been excited in connection with the recent terrible affair at Sandown, to abandon their intention of raising funds to enable them to erect a tablet expressive of their sympathy for the unfortunate sufferers; but your correspondent, Mr. F. A. Lewis, in your last *Observer*, informs your readers, on the authority of the *Daily Telegraph*, that "the ladies of Sandown are raising a subscription in postage stamps, with a view to erect a monument in commemoration of the poor children," &c.

I cannot dispossess myself of the impression that the ladies of Sandown are either cruelly slandered in this matter, or that they have not recovered from the shock which doubtless made tremble many a thoughtful mind in masculine frame. It would be well for those who are anxious to raise funds for such a purpose to pause and consider whether it is necessary or desirable to raise a monument which, while expressive of sympathies all of us must alike feel, will at the same time perpetuate the history of one of the most dreadful calamities that can befall the human mind. Surely there can be no supposed similarity between the circumstances attending the Sandown tragedy and those which induce a nation to raise memorials worthy of the heroes or of the victims of a patriotic war, or those which induce individuals to erect in the humble sea-side church-yard, graceful memorials of those unfortunates whom a treacherous sea throws lifeless upon our coast.

Allow me, Sir, to ask, in still more direct terms, "the ladies of Sandown" and their champion, the author of the acrostic *written in such bad taste*, why they wish to perpetuate, as such a monument must do, the recollection of so fearful a catastrophe. Can it have any healthy, religious, or moral tendency? It is well that we should be occasionally reminded of the uncertainty of life; but is it well, is it charitable, is it just to publish in our cemeteries the horrible actions of those on whom applications have fallen far more terrible to contemplate than death in any form?

I think it must be patent to all observers that if the public mind is allowed to dwell long and painfully on frightful passages of human history, it invariably leads to appalling repetitions.

I remain, Sir, your's obediently, F. N. B.

The Sandown Murders.— The grand jury have found a true bill against Whitworth, and his trial comers on tomorrow (Saturday). We understand that the wretched man has quite recovered from the injuries he inflicted on himself. The brother of Whitworth is at Winchester, and will in all probability give evidence to prove his insanity.

WINCHESTER SUMMER ASSIZES, July 17.

THE SANDOWN MURDERS.

*William Henry Whitworth*, a soldier, aged 39, was indicted for the wilful murder of Martha, his wife, and Frederick, William, Robert, Mary Ann, Elizabeth, and Ellen Whitworth, his six children, at Sandown, in the parish of Brading, Isle of Wight.

Mr. W. M. Cooke appeared for the prosecution; Mr. Cole for the defence.

It will be remembered that Whitworth, who was a sergeant of the Royal Artillery, was the master gunner at Sandown Fort, in which his quarters were situated, there residing with him his wife and six of his children, the seventh being absent. On the 13th May Whitworth ran across the parade ground, about half a mile distant from the fort, and threw himself upon his knees before Capt. Robinson, and exclaimed, "For God's sake, sir, save me!" He handed to Capt. Robinson his watch, some papers and money, and added, "He's used me dreadfully! He's held a pistol at my head and swore he'd shoot me if I didn't cut my throat!" then opened the collar of his coat, exhibited his throat cut and covered with blood, and said, "There's awful work down there; pray go down." He was sent to the hospital. On entering the house, bloody footprints—some, the unfortunate children's; others, those of Whitworth's stockings—were observed to cover the floor, showing that the children had escaped from the bedroom and been pursued down stairs, and driven up again by the murderer. The floor of the upper room was covered with blood, papers, clothing—and among other articles found were the razor and cutlass with which the murders had been perpetrated. There were two beds in the room. On the out side of that nearest the door was the body of Mrs. Whitworth, dressed, with the exception of her boots, and her neck so horrible gashed that the vertebrae of the neck were plainly visible. The wounds of the six children were all of the same character. Across the mother lay an infant, which had evidently been at the breast; and had clearly been murdered before it awoke. Near them were a boy and girl, whose bodies had been thrown upon the bed after their murder. On the bed nearest the window were two girls, and at the head of it a little boy; all were quite dead. The pillows show that they had been used to stifle the cries of the unfortunate victims.

The prisoner, when placed the bar, stared vacantly about the court, muttered some incoherent sentences, and was apparently eating something.

A jury was empanelled to try the question whether the prisoner could understand the pleadings to an indictment, and Dr. Lyford, the surgeon to the county gaol at Winchester, stated that the prisoner's mental powers were almost extinct, arising from the softening of the brain, a disease which had apparently been going on for some time.

The prisoner, who had placed his arm around the neck of the turnkey who had him charge, smiled at and pointed to his lordship, and appeared to be much amused at the appearance of the court.

After an explanatory address from his lordship, the jury found that the prisoner was unable to plead.

His lordship said, then he should direct the usual order to be made.

The gaoler motioned to the prisoner to leave the bar but he appeared quite unable to comprehend the meaning, and when at length he was led away by the arm, he exclaimed in a loud tone of voice, "Gracious God, look down upon you all, miserable sinners."
