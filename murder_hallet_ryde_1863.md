THE LATE RYDE TRAGEDIES.

It is announced daily "the publication of the Times commenced at o'clock yesterday morning, and finished at 7," and the public are left to guess at its meaning; in like manner, for this week only, we will announce that we went to Press with the first side of the Observer en Thursday morning last, and published large Extraordinary Edition early on Friday morning, containing full account of the murder of Mrs. Phelps and the attempted suicide of Robert Hallet. On Friday afternoon printed a Second Edition (or rather our Ordinary Edition), and, together, they did not at all supply the demand; we kept on printing until 1.30 on Saturday afternoon, when we published a Third Edition, containing an account of the suicide of Barnahaa Bull, formerly in good circumstances at Bembridge farm, and well known in Hyde and at Butteraea as a "crack ahot" in pigeon inatchea, the demand still continued unabated, we published 4.30 on Monday sr noon a Fourth Edition, containing an account of the inquest upon poor Bull. The largest numbers the ever printed before were, on the occasion of the Sandown fort tragedy; the marriage of the Prince of Wales; and the K.V.Y.C. regatta of thi* year. But the edition* of last week exceeds those nearly Two Thousand copies ; indeed the sale of the Ofamer was limited only by the capacity of our machinery. Considering that others were in the market either before simultaneously with us, this result is a proof of the confidence we have gained. After the inquest on Thursday last, the body of the murdered woman wa* placed in a parish coffin, and aa was then lying the same room where Hallet the murderer waa (and from the state of his throat it deemed unadvisable to move him), was taken to the dead-house near the Hyde Cemetery. On Friday afternoon it was buried with funeral rite*, by the Her. Mr. Yoeman, the presence of large concourse of people, and amongst them waa Charlotte Pickering, concerning whom the quarrel between the deceased and Hallet took place. We have received *ever*l letters animadverting upon the fact that the burial service was read over this unfortunate victim of crime; but whilst make no pretence to be better than our neighbours, we hold that a newspaper is not the proper place to discuss points of religious acrimony, and, moreover, wc ask, Where is the Christian charity which places this poor woman's state lower than that of the thief upon the cross We are not religious enough to be bigotted. and nothing short of bigotry will be presumptious enough condemn this poor woman ; wc will not it, nor suffer any one else to do so in these columns. A most remarkable circumstance occurred in connection with tragedy. A daughter of Hallet'a, who is married and living at Southampton, had not heard of it on Saturday morning (as her friends thought ahe would know of it soon enough without writing to her), when she was out and saw some newspaper placards on the walls announcing a murder at Ryde. and she said instantly, "My father is concerned in that." Indeed all the family were constantly dreading something of the kind; and it was not till she obtained a copy of the newspaper there advertised that she learned the dreadful truth. As Hallet partly severed his windpipe, silver tube was passed down; and that has caused him much irritation, which renders it difficult to deal with him. Mr. Barrow expresses his opinion that Hallet will recover from the wound, which is most unfortunate circumstance, and use the word "unfortunate" advisedly. Samuel Sanders considers himself aggrieved because stated that he and his wife and Phelps and his wife formerly lived together in large unoccupied house when and where a deed of darkness was dune. Sanders says his wife took care of the house, but he continued live at Weeks's. The point is of no importance, but we correct it, notwithstanding his abuse.

TO DO

MURDER AND ATTEMPTED SUICIDE AT RYDE.

Early on the dark and wet December morning of Wednesday last the news—as such news always will be—was rapidly spread over Ryde and the Isle of Wight, that a man had cut a woman's head nearly off, and afterwards attempted to commit suicide by cutting his own throat. Upon further enquiry, we obtained the following version of the tragedy, narrated by the father-in-law of the victim, as he was on his way to Weeks's, Ryde, just it was getting light in the morning ; a few hours after the crime was committed. On Tuesday night Robert Hallett (the murderer) Mary Ann Phelps (the murdered woman and paramour of Hallet's), Hallet's son, and Samuel Sanders (father-in-law of the woman), met at Hallet's house, small cottage in Cullimore's yard, situated in St. John's; road, Ryde. It was a "drinking party," and the nar! rator could not tell how long they sat drinking, or what time they went to bed. However, for very obvious reasons, Sanders could not get home to his own house at Weeks's, so slept with Hallet's son. Sanders had knowledge how long he had been in bed and asleep, but about o'clock was aroused by Mary Ann crying, Father, father, make haste." He got up soon as he could, and he and Hallet's son hunted for some matches; but, as Sanders said, being "boosy," they could not find any for a long time. When they found the matches and got a light, and came down where Hallet and his paramour were, to use his own words, There it wot The poor woman's head was nearly sundered from her body, which was undressed, except chemise and stays. Hallet was in his shirt only, leaning over, her. Sanders could not tell whether they had quarrelled or not, or at all events he said so. One thing, however, is certain, that at the time of his telling the tale,-he was so ?? that it must be matter of impossibility for him to state with any degree of certainty what took place. As, however, the details, so far as they can be supplied will come out before the proper tribunals, we will give a sketch of the history of the parties, as examples to be avoided. The neighbours were aroused; the police were sent for ; and (very remissly) after a long Interval, the medical gentlemen, who ought to have been called first. Mr. Barrow arrived first, and then Mr. Woodward (who it is fair to say had been for a fortnight attending Hallet for nervous complaints); and then Mr. Barrow left for his surgical instruments and called in his partner, Dr. Darcy. Hallet exclaimed, on seeing Mr. Woodward, "She did it." Previous Career op the Pasties. On Christmas morning, about 38 or 39 years ago— we recollect the circumstance well—James (alias Clark) Williams, Jane Lavers, and Benjamin Salter were arrested by Coroner's warrant on a charge of manslaughter, the victim being Richard (alias Dick) Button. How it arose was this: Jane had summoned Dick the Saturday previous before the magistrates at Newport to show cause why he should not support her illegitimate female child of which she alleged him to be the father. She got judgment; so Dick, after leaving Court, became terribly enraged and threatened her, for, if we remember aright, he denied "the soft impeachment." In this posture of affairs, Jane accidentally met Clark and Ben, and they being fellow-villagers (for Ryde was then a village, and it was the custom of folk to to Newport, then called "town," of a Saturday), she put herself under their protection, and course all got on drinking. Near midnight the three left Newport on foot for Ryde, and when they arrived near Smallgains, Dick, who had been laying in wait, came upon the scene, and sought to wreak his vengeance, as threatened, upon Jane. The others interfered, and all being drunk general fight was carried on, during which Dick got a blow and was felled to the ground. He was removed to an adjoining homestead and laid upon some straw, but the following morning he died: hence the arrest. We forget whether the parties were acquitted or suffered a short term of imprisonment ; but they returned to Ryde and the two men have since died, and the woman was married to Samuel Sanders. What has this to do with the present murder? Why, this illegitimate female child was afterwards known "Poll Sanders," "unfortunate;", but having some good qualities in her, poor girl! she was married to Edward Phelps, respectable coachsmith. Accordingly she became Mary Ann Phelps, the murdered woman. Another Chapter. ' ' After marriage Poll could not leave off all her old ways, which raised a terrible spirit of jealousy and revenge in the mind of her husband; and one Saturday night, about 13 or 14 years ago—we were on the jury arising out of it—the climax occurred. Sanders and his wife, and Phelps and his wife, Hvfd together in St. Peter's, a large unoccupied house in Ryde, and aided by some friends on the night named th'fey had a "drinking bout." However Phelps left early in the evening for short time to get his wages, and Poll took advantage of his absence to meet a paramour, so it was supposed. Phelps returned and found his spouse gone, so he left the drinking party and laid in wait amongst the trees waiting her return. The next day the news spread over the town "Dickey Far Tell is killed." At the inquest there was an amount of stubborn reticence which nearly led to the witnesses being committed for contempt but their theory was that Dickey fell over a low wall near the side entrance of the house and pitched on his head in the area below, and thus met hi* fate. The dying man's deposition stated that he received the blow—from whom and how he could not tell—as he was coming out from subterranean passage into the area, on the way to the kitchen entrance, in company with Poll. The jury taking into consideration the provocation and threats of Phelps, together with the above deposition and the shape and position of the wound on the head, gave verdict of manslaughter against Phelps, and he suffered a short imprisonment. What went with him ultimately, we do not know. Poll thus became the paramour Robert Hallet, and her dreadful end is strange commentary upon the dreadful deeds her life was associated with, partly without her consent or fault, and partly with. An Outline op Hallpt's Career. The parents of Robert Hallet lived for many years a honourable life at Binstead Lodge farm, where they brought up their family with credit. Robert was once a fine-looking man, slt. Bin. or 9in. high and stoutly made ; he married a respectable young woman of Ryde, who, by ill-usuage and other causes, was brought to a premature grave. Drinking, whoring, and fighting afterwards characterised his career, and brought down his parents' grey hairs in sorrow to the grave. About 10 or 11 years ago he figured at the Ryde Sessions, and he threatened more than once to "stick" us for reporting his case, but of course we thought (rather too lightly, it seems) he would never do it. Subsequently he became steadier, and married a respectable widow of Ryde, who, long since, separated from him, and to secure herself from his extortion and violence is compelled to trade in her son's name; she deserves sympathy. On the death of his mother he became possessed of a little property, and we believe he holds some of it now, in one of which houses the murder took place. He is about 56 years of age. He frequently appeared before the magistrates, and so lately August last charged a woman with whom he then lived of robbing him of bed clothes, when they accused one another of drunkenness ; but the Court dismissed the case, the things it appeared were taken and sold for drink with his consent. In October he was charged with assaulting Eliia Ash, a neighbour, whose fault was sheltering and feeding his child whom he had turned out of doors. Mrs. Ash swore "he used most awful language, and threatened to strike her, putting his fist into her face. He then struck her and kicked her legs for which he was fined. At that time he was working at Barnsley and living at Prestwood. Since then he returned to Ryde and cohabitated with the woman he murdered. So that this tragical affair was not the effect a sudden outburst of passion, but rather the natural—if such a diabolical crime can be called natural—consequences of a vicious life.

INQUEST ON THE BODY.

VERDICT OF WILFUL MURDER AGAINST ROBERT HALLET.

The inquest on the body of Mary Ann Phelps was held before F. Blake, esq., coroner for the Island, the Star inn, on Thursday. The jury having proceeded to the house and viewed the body, the first witness called was Samuel Sanders, who lives at Weeks's, near Ryde. The deceased was about years of age, and was his wife's daughter before her marriage. She was separated from her husband, Edward Phelps, about five years. lie coachman, and is now living. She had been living with Robert Hallet, on and off, about two years. They had lately lived in St. John's-road, in a house belonging to Hallet. He is farm labourer, and his son George lived with him. There were only two rooms, one upstairs and one downstairs. Hallet and deceased generally slept in the upper room. (the witness) went to Hallet's about o'clock Tuesday evening. The deceased and Hallet and his son were all there. They seemed good terms. lie remained all the evening. They had three half-gallons of sixpenny ale, which they all partook. The deceased also drank a half-quartern brandy. They were about 1 three hours drinking this. Hallet and witness went for the drink, and the brandy was handed him by ' 1 This is wrong: deceased was either II age; not - j more.—Ld. 1 Mallet to give to the deceased. The brandy was received direct from the landlord, and given to him, that he was certain nothing could hare been put into it. There was a little throwing off on the part of the deceased about Charlotte Pickering, who had before lived with Hallet. She said she did not want to live with him any longer. Witness advised them to be quiet, and they then danced and sung, and seemed very peaceable. Soon after 11 o'clock was going home, and had got out of doors, when Hallet pressed him to stop and sleep there with the boy, and he did so. The boy and himself went to bed a little after 12 o'clock. Hallet and deceased said they would sleep on the sofa down stairs. They were all a little "elevated," but not what rolled drunk, as he knew everything that took place, he went sleep in a very few minutes, and did not hear anything then. During the night he heard a cry of "Father, father." He took no notice of it, and he did not suspect anything. He went off to sleep again, and sometime after that the boy and himself were suddenly awoke. He could not tell what it was, but they jumped out of bed together. The boy struck a light, and they went downstairs. When he got down he saw the deceased laying on her face on the floor, and a pool of blood around ber. She was partly dressed, and Hallet was lying by her aide, near the sofa, with his head on her left shoulder. He had nothing on him but his flannel shirt. He pulled the sheet off the sofa and covered himself with it as far as his shoulders. He did not at that time see the state of his throat. He did not attempt to raise them up, but sent the boy to call the neighbours. The door was locked, and the boy broke it open with billhook and poker. There was no key in the door. Mr. Cooper soon came. Witness said to Hallet, "This is pretty thing but he did not reply. He did not notice any knife at that time. When the police came he first noticed the carving knife now produced. He was not aware that it belonged to Hallet. They had no supper on the previous night, so that no knives were used. Hallet and the deceased never agreed long together. He never struck her, to his knowledge, he said to her that night, "If I don't have you, nobody else shall." He had often heard him say the same words. He a&ked her to kiss him, and she turned her bead away. She had different occasions separated from him, and ways' came after her again. They had bean separated within the last month, and he came after her, and she went back to him on the 1st of December. George Hallet, son of Robert Hallet, who cried bitterly during the time of giving his evidence, said that he believed he was about years of age; he was not sure, as his father had never told him. He could not read write, as he had never been taught, having gone to work long he could recollect. He was at home on Tuesday evening, and went after half-a-gallon of sixpenny beer. They had two more cans after that, and all drank, but himself not much. Mr. Sanders brought in some brandy, which deceased drank. During the evening there was a row about Charlotte Pickering, who had been living with his father when deceased left him. Deceased caught hold of his father's hair, and he pushed her back. They both appeared very angry. Sanders asked them to be quiet, and they got friendly. One danced and the other sung. They were tipsy, and so was Sanders, who had gone out of the gate to go home, when witness's father brought him back. Sanders and witness then went to bed about 12 o'clock, and Hallet and deceased came upstairs to see them into bed, and then went downstairs and shut the' stair-foot door. They seemed on very friendly terms then. He heard them talking after they had got down. On the following morning, between and S, he heard cries "murder," apparently from both. He had heard aach cries before, and took but little notice. He was sure he heard both voices, though he thought Mrs. Phelps cried out first. He had heard her cry out "murder" very often when they were fighting. He (Hallet) often said he would murder ber. He did not get up in consequence of the cry, as it was nearly time for him to go to work. Sanders got out of bed, and said, "Oh! they are quarrelling again." They went downstairs together. There was a rushlight burning there. Witness saw Mrs. Phelps laying down, with her face to the floor, and his father by her side, with his head on ber shoulder and one arm across her body. There was blood close to her head. It was only a few minutes after the cry of "murder," and she was then breathing. He heard her sigh several times. He could not find the key of the door, and wrenched it open. He then rushed out for Cooper, but was so terrified he did not go into the room again, nor had he been since. When he went for the billhook to open the door he saw the carving knife on the table. There was blood on it, as also on the chairs. He should think his father could have reached the table if he stood upright. The carving knife was his father's, and had been left to him by his grandmother, and was usually kept in the knife box in the cupboard. That was the knife witness's father often said he would murder the deceased with if she left him, unless it was to live with her husband. On Tuesday evening she said she had a very good house, and would go to it, and threatened to her mother's that night. He said, "Wherever I'M come. get killed Ibr it," Md* she said, "You would not dare to come there." Both the doors were locked, and the keys taken out. He never knew that to be done before. James Saunders, of 49, Albert-street, who stated that he wss no relation the previous witness, Sanders, said on Wednesday morning, about quarter-past o'clock, he heard a very loud knocking at Mr. Coo:er's, next door. Some one called out, "For God's sake come down." He immediately ran down to the passage leading to Hallet's. Cooper came out his house at the same moment. Samuel Sanders came out and said, "You'll see a fine sight." He (witness) took a candle and went in, and saw both of them bleeding. He told Cooper to go for the police, while and Sanders remained there. Witness said, "wonder what he did it with i" and the boy, who was outside the door, said, "I took the knife out of father's hand and put it on the table." Was quite sure the soy said this. He touched the deceased's leg, and she wss not cold. She was Crtly dressed, and her face lying to the floor, and the clothes round both. Hallet kicked out several times, but did not speak at that time. was quite positive the boy said he had taken the knife out of his father's hand. The lad appeared very much alarmed. At this stage of the proceedings, the boy was re-called, and said he never saw the knife in his father's hand. He saw the last witness in the room, and heard him say, "I wonder what he did it with?" said, "There is the knife on the table." If he said, "I took it out of his hand," it was said in his fright, for he did not do so. He was quite sure he had not touched the knife, either in his father's hand or on the table. Ashley Cooper, of 50, Albert-street, said he was called by Sanders and the boy about quarter-past 6 on Wednesday morning, and got up directly and went to Hallet's, where he saw deceased and Hallet on the floor. He did not stop, but went for the police, and returned with Sergeant Mitchell. He saw the knife now produced on the table. Hallet and the deceased frequently quarrelled. About three months ago himself and brother were called in to separate them when fighting. They were crying murder on that occasion. He took him away from beating her, and she then flew him. P.S. Mitchell said he was called soon after o'clock on Wednesday morning by the lost witness. He found the body of deceased lying her face about half a yard from the sofa. Hallet was on the left hand of her, his leg partly on her, and one arm round her waist. There was only a sheet over him. The deceased was partly undressed. He called out to Hallet, but received no reply. With assistance he pulled him on his back, and placed him on the sofa. He saw there was wound in his throat, and gave directions to keep him flat on his back, and secure his hands. He then examined deceased and found her quite dead, though warm. Her hands clenched and raised towards her neck. There great quantity of blood, but Halle: had not lost much. When Dr. Barrow came he was very much excited, and lost a great quantity of blood. On the table were two pipes, a can, and glass, in which was some beer; the knife. Shortly after Hallet had been placed on the sofa, he pointed to Samuel Sanders and the deceased, saying. "They have robbed me; go and search their house." also said, "I got 275. yesterday, and its all gone." About 11 o'clock the same night he again saw him, and asked how he was. He shook his head. He told him to keep himself quiet. He said it happened all through drink, as it always flew to his head. He said, "They had had nine quarts of sixpenny, and brandy three times, and were all drunk together. The keys had since been found on the window-ledge, and purse containing 7s. 3Jd. Superintendent Iloran said that Hallet had been in custody the lock-up in Newport in September, 1862, apprehended on a warrant for threatening to murder the deceased, and he then admitted he was the person who had been apprehended on the 20th of the previous month on similar charge, for which he was ordered find sureties to keep the peace for six months. On the 13th he was discharged with caution. B. Barrow, esq., F.K.S., medical practitioner in Ryde, was called on Wednesday morning, about quarter past o clock. When got to Hallet's he found the body of deceased the floor. The man was on his back on the sofa. He lifted deceased's face up, and discovered a wound about four inches long the front part of the neck, extending to the windpipe. It was clean cut, such might have been produced by knife of that description. There was no other wound. The face, limbs, and body were quite warm. There was no evidence of her having struggled or resisted in any way. She could not have been dead hour. There appeared be large quantity of blood on the floor and on the things around her.

THE LATE TRAGEDY IN RYDE.

It is considered *infra dig.* for the Local Press to interfere with what is called the administration of justice; but the London Press is never called to account, and the course it has taken in the murderer Townlet's case justifies ours, unless all scribes be condemned alike. There is a man, named Robert Hallet, in custody of the police at his own house in Ryde, in consequence of his throat being cut and not in a fit state to be removed, charged with having murdered Mary Ann Phelps. It is not our intention to say a single word in palliation of the crime of this man; but in the prosecution of him there appears to us to be a violation of principle, which, if silently passed over, may help to form a precedent dangerous to innocence itself at a future time. What we are going to state is no novelty, for the police knew the circumstances and they were publicly talked of over Ryde before the inquest was held in this behalf; therefore the onus is again thrown upon us—and we are determined not to shirk our duty—of seeing justice done.

On the evening of the tragedy, December 9th, and the day before the inquest was held, we obtained the following particulars. Mr. Woodward, surgeon of Ryde, arrived on the scene about 6.30 a.m., Mr. Barrow, another surgeon, having arrived a few minutes before, and immediately left again to go after his surgical instruments and who returned with his partner, Dr. Davey. During this absence, Mr. Woodward had a better opportunity of examining the dead woman whilst the body was warm, and of taking into consideration the position of both parties than afterwards occurred; and he availed himself of the opportunity. Moreover Mr. Woodward had bean attending Hallet the previous fortnight for nervous complaints; and the latter muttered on seeing the former, "She did it." Mr. Woodward's opinion then and there formed was, *that the wound in the throat was not the cause of the woman's death*: because it was a slight flesh transverse wound, and neither windpipe nor any important vein or artery was severed. He said that that wound could not cause death, but that its cause must be sought for otherwise. He further said that Hallet's wound was by far the worst of the two, and that it was remarkable for being a left-handed cut; which facts, taken into consideration with the position the bodies were found in and Hallet's statement to him, were very remarkable.

At this point we shall leave Mr. Woodward's opinion, and it must be taken for what it is worth. Judge, then, our surprise, on reading the report of the Coroner's inquest on Friday morning, to find that Mr. Woodward had not been called as a witness! That neglect, and not whether his evidence be good or bad, is the point of which, on behalf of the public, we complain, and justifiably too; for we can see but three pleas to be set up: expense of two medical witnesses instead of one, or professional jealousy on the one hand or *esprit de corps* on the other; and all three together ought not to weigh a feather when it is a question of life or death. On the Friday afternoon, about three hours before the woman was buried, Mr. Woodward called upon us, when we put the question, "How was it you were not at the inquest?" He replied, "he did not know, but it was strange." We asked, "Was there no *post mortem* examination?" He replied, "No." We further asked, "How, then, was the cause of death known?" He replied, "He did not know, *but the wound did not cause it!*"

As the police who had charge of the ease knew of these things, and several of the jurymen must have heard of the rumours, though probably the Coroner did not, we felt there was either neglect or unfairness shown; we therefore offered to Mr. Woodward, if he would draw up a short statement, we would stop the Press and insert it, in order to cause a *post mortem* examination before burial. He declined, and we have not had any communication with him since; and we are sorry we did not act alone at the time. For the conclusions we drew at once were (having the Road Murder in mind): 1, that Mr. Woodward ought to have been examined; 2, that there ought to have been a *post mortem* examination; and, 3, that the inquest ought to have been adjourned till HALLET could have given evidence, for then he could, now he cannot, and no man ought to be deprived of what benefits the law allows.

It will be seen that we do not impugn Mr. Barrow's evidence or extol Mr. Woodward's; we only demand fair play. Still, if Mr. Woodward's evidence had been taken,—if a *post mortem* had followed, —and Hallet had been heard, —the verdict may or may not have been the same; but the satisfaction to the public would have been greater. Therefore our object now is, to remedy the defects as far as possible at the magistrates' enquiry next week.

TRIAL OF HALLET FOR THE MURDER OF MARY ANN PHELPS.

Thursday.—Before Mr. Baron Bramwell.

*Robert Budden Hallett* was indicted for the wilful murder of Mary Ann Phelps at Ryde on the 9th of December.

Mr. A. T. Cole and Mr. Buller prosecuted, and Mr. Carter defended the prisoner.

The evidence given was precisely as it has already appeared these columns, and it useless, therefore, to recapitulate it.

Mr. Carter addressed the jury on behalf of the prisoner, and strongly urged, for all that appeared by the evidence, that the woman had inflicted the wounds; or that one her paramours might have come in and inflicted them.

The learned Judge having summed up with great care,

The jury retired for about hour, and then came into Court, and asked whether, if they thought the prisoner did it in a moment of passion arising from jealousy, they could return a verdict of manslaughter.

The Judge.—Certainly not. If a man takes the life of another it is murder, unless he can satisfy the jury of something which shall reduce it to manslaughter. The only scrap of evidence to that effect was that some days after the transaction he said she had cut his throat first; but did not make that excuse until he had had time to think about his defence.

The jury then retired, and returned in an hour and half, and then gave a verdict of Not Guilty.

Whatever opinions may be formed by the public, as to whether there was a grave miscarriage of justice in this case, or not, it is certain that Mr. Baron Bramwell had considerable doubts as to the legal weight of the evidence, as will be seen by the following extract of his charge to the grand jury, at the opening of the assizes: "The first and most important case in the calender was that of a man named Hallet, who was charged with murder. There was no doubt that the woman came to violent death— that was to say, her throat was cut, and, it was quite certain, cut by herself or by the prisoner. There was no doubt about that. They, and two witnesses against whom there was no suspicion, were the only people in the house when the occurrence took place, and the question for the jury would be whether her throat was cut by herself or by the prisoner. He did not collect from the medical evidence that there was any impossibility, any difficulty, in either being the case, but there was evidence of a very striking character to show that the prisoner was the man who did it. There were previous threats uttered against her, and statements afterwards of the reason why he did it, which would probably make them think that, *to say the least of it, it was case which they should send for trial before a petty-jury.*" Such language as that italicised indicates the essence of doubt; it is no wonder, therefore, that the jury, after two hours and a half of deliberation, should have doubts also; and, in the present state of the law, give the prisoner the benefit of it. Barbarous laws defeat themselves.

As the enquiry has been made repeatedly at our office (Friday) morning, how comes it that the Judge directed a verdict "guilty" or "not guilty" upon the charge of murder and prohibited a verdict of manslaughter against Hallet, when Lacey and Wadden, upon similar charges, were convicted of manslaughter? so we referred to our file. In both those cases coroner's juries returned verdicts of murder, but the magistrates afterwards committed for manslaughter; whereas in Hallet's case both the jury and magistrates sent him for trial upon the charge of murder. Hence the result, of acquittal.
