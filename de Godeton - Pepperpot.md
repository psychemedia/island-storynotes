# Walter de Godeton and the Pepperpot

*An account, then a story...*

## The History of the Pepperpot

If you look at map of the Isle of Wight, you'll see it takes the form of a diamond sitting just off the south coast of the Big Island, mainland England, across the Solent from Portsmouth and Southampton.

The southernmost tip is known as St Catherine's Point; it's flanked by the village of Niton to the East, and Blackgang Chine to the West.

Looking inland, you'll see St Catherine's Hill looming in front of you, topped off by St Catherine's Oratory, commonly known as *the Pepperpot*.

In the early 1300s, in the reign of Edward II, the sea provided as much of an income to the Islanders living thereabouts as the farming. And not just from fishing... 

...but also from wrecks.

In year of 1313, on the Sunday after Easter, the Saint Mary, of Bayonne, went down on Atherfield Ledge in Chale Bay. Carrying 174 tuns [large casks, each containing approximately 252 gallons] of white wine from France, the majority of the crew survived, and many of the barrels were washed ashore.

According to chapter of IV of Edward I's Statute of Westminster of 1275, *CONCERNING Wrecks of the Sea*, it was agreed "That where a Man, a Dog, or a Cat escape quick out of the Ship, that such Ship nor Barge, nor any thing within them, shall be adjudged Wreck"; any goods washing ashore from them would be held for a year and a day so that the owner could reclaim them.

Some stories have it that the survivors proceeded to sell the wrecked barrels at a discount rate; but whatever happened that night, the barrels made their way into the hands of the Islanders.

The merchants who had lost their goods were, unsurprisingly, not very happy about it, and took the case to court in Southampton at the start of June; they appealed their £1000 loss, perhaps three quarters of a million pounds in today's money, perhaps more, with charges laid against those who ended up receiving the goods.

The case dragged on in further sessions until a hearing in the first week of Lent the following year, February 1314. Islander Walter de Godeton, of Gotten Manor, was charged with receiving over fifty barrels of the salvaged wine and fined a considerable sum: 150 pounds or so in the money of the time. To compel the payment of such a hefty amount, much of his goods and lands were seized until payment could be made.

The fine does not appear to have changed his attitudes much though: his name appears again court records of 1323 regarding receiving goods from the wreck of the Jesus Christ, a Portuguese cargo vessel wrecked off Brighstone in 1318.
  
But the story doesn't stop there for de Godeton. At least some of the cargo that had been lost from the St Mary had been destined for a monastery in Northern France; to plunder it was sacrilege. According to [web legend](https://h2g2.com/edited_entry/A87770334) / some accounts, the Pope summoned de Godeton to the ecclesiastical court in Rome, where he was told that he would be "excommunicated from the church and his soul would be damned to burn in Hell for all eternity" unless he performed an act of penance. To atone for his sin, he agreed to provide a 'chaunting priest' to say masses for his soul, for those of his ancestors, and for all those souls lost at sea, along with 'a light for the benefit of mariners, to be lit every night for ever'. The site was to be on Chale Down, where a smaller hermitage had been established the previous year. Although only the foundations of the oratory have survived as earthworks still visible today (??), the lighthouse remains in the form of the 35 foot high tower known locally as "the Pepper Pot", Britain's only surviving medieval lighthouse. (Only the Roman lighthouse at Dover is older.)

The old lighthouse itself has an eight-sided pyramid shaped roof with eight rectangular openings, unglazed windows, you might say, to allow the light from a fire set at the top of the tower to be seen at sea. The four buttresses that strengthen the lower part of the tower were not part of the original lighthouse, but were added in the 18th century.  ??date


completed 1728, de godeton died the year before

The end of the oratory as a religious site came with the dissolution of the monasteries in ???, but the lighthouse continued to operate until 17??; another one started in 1785 ?? (circular stump forming the base remains still there), but never completed.

No lighthouse for the next ?? years, but if you were to look back down to St Catherine's point from the St Catherine's Hill, you'd see the "new" lighthouse built in ???

And thereby lays another tale...



 The lighthouse, which formed the western tower of the oratory is all that survives of the original building. However, the remains of the walls, are visible as earthworks forming three sides of a square with the lighthouse on the open, west, side. The oratory walls are about 12 metres apart and survive to a height of one metre

## Walter de Godeton and the Shipwrecked Wine

Walter de Godeton, Lord of the Manor, liked nothing better than supplementing his meals with a large goblet of wine.

And why not?

Life was good. He had land, and it was productive enough. There was trade for those who had a mind to dabble in such things. And living on an island, and close to the sea at that, the sea would often provide: crab, lobster, the oyster beds to the north of the island; and mackerel: on a fair day, at the right time of year, you could fair see the mackerel from the top of the cliff, swimming just above the sea ledge below.

And oh, my, how the sea had provided today. With Easter just a week gone by, bringing with it the end of Lent, the time for self-restraint was over. And whilst it wasn't the nicest of Sundays – a storm had rolled in after all – the Lord had provided: a ship, the Saint Mary — oh, Hail Mary for providing for us so – sailing too close to shore in an attempt to avoid the worst of the sea, had run aground. 

 *Now don't me wrong, there was no sign of wrecking in these parts, it was an unfortunate accident, no more no less, God's doing if anyone's. And the saving of the crew was surely God's work too.*

The islanders were quick to make the shore, they always were: the law of the kingdom was quite clear: if Man, Dog, or Cat escape the ship alive, it would be judged a wreck, and as such, any goods washing ashore were to be held for a year and a day so that the owner could reclaim them. But the local tradition was also a bit more circumspect: if things washed ashore where your land abutted the sea, well, then those things were rightfully yours.

True, if it looked like there may only be one or two survivors, then maybe, maybe, the sea would reclaim them, and, ahem, well, then maybe things could turn out a little differently. But when it was clear that many of the sailors could be saved, the islanders would be quick to come their aid; and no less quick to help salvage what they could.

Now it was also true that merchant sailors were a resourceful and pragmatic bunch too. After all, goods could be lost to the sea as easily as they could come ashore; and, well, if an agreement could be made to sell, at a discount, what might have been lost were it not helpfully brought ashore, well, then you did what you could to make the best of a bad job and try to recover something having lost your ship.

Who knows whether the sailors were complicit, or profited that day. Nor how many of the 174 barrels of wine on board the St Mary, each containing 250 gallons or so of the finest wine, the finest wine indeed, made it ashore. But many of the barrels did... And so whether a hasty deal was done, right there, right there on the shore, or perhaps more leisurely, in one of island inns when the storm had abated and the salvage accounted for, or whether the sailors had no choice in the matter as the barrels were whisked up the chines, de Godeton had done well for himself: for he had secured near enough fifty of the barrels for himself. 50 barrels. Oh, he'd be able to turn a tidy profit on that, no doubt.

Yes, thought de Godeton. Things were going well.

But... there's always a but... The merchant who had chartered the ship was not happy; not happy at all.

When he heard of the wreck, he was keen to recover his wine. But those good for nothing sailors - why, by whatever law of the sea you cared to reckon against: that wine was still his. The sailors for sure would not be able to pay him back, but he'd make those pay who had profited from the sale of that wine, God Preserve his soul. The charges were laid, first at the county court, then, when he still failed to get restitution, to a Commission at Westminster. By God, he would take it to the very King himself if he must.

de Godeton played the innocent. First, he claimed to have had nothing to do at all with *illegally* receiving the wine; then, he claimed he had bought it, fair and square, from the crew of the wrecked ship. He was not a sailing man, after all, and the law of the sea, well, he took it on trust that the sailors were entitled to sell him the wreckage. It had been their ship after all.

The jury, city men, not sailors, not provincial landowners, sided with the merchant. de Godeton, for the 50 barrels or so of wine he had received, should pay for his crime. At five marks a barrel (that's 13s 4d in new old money), the fine came in at well over 200 marks, £150 or so, maybe £100k in today's money.

Now there was no way that de Godeton could cover that sort of fine just like that. It would take time to pay off such a sum, even for a relatively wealthy landowner. And the rate he would have got selling on the wine, and perhaps the costs of transporting it for sale to the mainland, would surely not have been the full market price used to calculate the fine.

And so it was, that until such a time as de Godeton could pay off the debt, his goods and half his lands and tenement leases would be used as surety. The horses and oxen to pull his ploughs he could keep: he would need to have some means of paying back the fine, after all.

Now, you might think that was punishment enough. But God works in a mysterious way. For it wasn't just the merchant who was so affronted by the loss of his wine from the St Mary. The Church wasn't happy either. De Godeton's luck was about to get to get a whole lot worse.

For the wine, the very fine wine, wasn't just any wine. It was intended as communion wine, headed for an Abbey in another Kingdom. And the Abbott who had been looking forward to the arrival of the wine, for religious purposes, of course, was livid. This was plunder. This was SACRILEGE, an offence against the Church, an offence against God, the very despoilation of the Blessed Virgin Mary. No mere county assizes this time. As the story has it, this was a matter for a Papal court.

And so it was: having been convicted once already in a legal court, the Papal Court had no hesitation in finding against de Godeton and his crimes against the Church, his crimes against God: de Godeton would have to pay the ultimate sacrifice, excommunication, his soul damned to burn in Hell for all eternity, unless he atoned for his sins by creating a marker, a beacon, to benefit mariners and warn them of the treacherous nature of the coastal boundary to de Godeton's land; and de Godeton was also to pay for a chaunting priest in that place to keep the light burning and to pray for his very soul, for his ancestors, and for all those souls lost at sea.

And here the tale does end. The lighthouse was built, although de Godeton was to die before it was fully completed. As to whether his soul was saved in time, or damned to eternity, who can say?

The lighthouse still stands to this day, on the high down just inland from the southernmost point of the Isle of Wight, Britain's only surviving medieval lighthouse, with only the Roman lighthouse at Dover being older. Known officially as St Catherine's Oratory, it's rather unusual octagonal shape gives it its more colloquial, local name: The Pepperpot.

If you are fortunate enough to ever walk up there, you can look down onto the ledge, where on a dark and stormy day in 1313, on the Sunday after Easter, the Saint Mary of Bayonne was blown onto the ledge, and her cargo of communion wine washed ashore.

And de Gotten's ancestral home: that exists still, too, as Gotten Manor. It's a B&B now. Tell them I sent you.

Cheers...

Collections for the history of Hampshire, and the bishopric of Winchester: including the Isles of Wight, Jersey, Guernsey, and Sarke, by D. Y. With the original Domesday of the county, and an accurate English translation, ... By Richard Warner, ... Illustrated with upwards of sixty plates, ... In six volumes. ...  1795: Vol 1
by D. Y.
 1795
 
The manor of Godyton, in this parish, gave name to its ancient possessors. Walter de Godyton, in the year 1323, built a chapel on Chale down, dedicatcd to St. Catharine, assigning certain rents for a chantry Priest to sing mass, and also to provide lights, for the ſafety of such vessels as chanced to come on that dangerous coast during the night. At the dissolution of chantries, it was, perhaps, found impracticable to divide the useful from the superstitious part of the institution ; so that the whole fell together, the chantry involving the light-house in its ruin.

By an entry in the regiſters of this dioceſe, it appears, that eleven years before the erection of this chapel, there was an hermitage standing on the same spot : the entry is as follows: *Walter de Langstrell, admissus ad hermitorium supra montem de Chale, in insula Vectis, Tail. Octobris, A. D. 1312*.

The situation pointed it out for a sea mark; it being about 750 feet above high water level, half a mile from the ſhore, and commanding a moſt extenſive view. The tower of the chapel is yet standing, and is known by the name of St. Catharine's Tower: it is thirty-five feet six inches high; octangular without, and quadrangular within, finished with a pyramidical roof; each side, interior as well as exterior, being exactly four feet. From this conſtruction, the curious have found out ſome resemblance to the temple of the eight winds at Athens—a building, it is more than probable the architect never saw, or ever heard of.“

St. Catharine's tower ſtill remains of most essential use, by day, to vessels navigating the channel: but having become extremely ruinous, its fall was to be apprehended ; and, as it sudden disappearance might have been attended with fatal consequences, it was substantially repaired, and its angles strengthened with buttresses, at the expence of the lord of the manor. The foundation of the whole chapel is also cleared and levelled ; by which, not only its figure was discovered, but also the floor and stone hearth of the Priest's little cell, at the south-west corner, close to the tower

Researching some local stories for if/when Island Storytellers ever get to tell again(!) I am trying to find original materials relating to court cases surrounding William de Godeton (Goditon) from the 1300s, particularly in respect of cases relating to wrecking and the receipt of wrecked goods relating to the wrecks of:
 
Saint Mary / Blessed Mary 1313 https://www.pastscape.org.uk/hob.aspx?hob_id=1119117
Jesus Christ 1318? https://www.pastscape.org.uk/hob.aspx?hob_id=899227
 
I’ve found mentions in the Calendar of Patent Rolls, eg as cited in the above records via archive.org, but I’m not sure where to find the records or transcripts of the actual court hearings or their decisions.
 
Many local tellings of the wreck of the Saint Mary also mention more detail of hearings on 8th June 1313 (Southampton), then Winchester 20th July 1313 and  finally 22nd February 1314  (location?) which resulted not least in a fine of 227.5 (?) marks to de Goditon.
 
QUESTION: do you know where I might find or access records, copies or transcripts of the actual court hearings or their decisions?
 
A Gotten Manor history (https://www.gottenmanor.co.uk/history/) suggests “[de Goditon] was fined so heavily that all his goods had to be distrained, “except the horses and oxen of his ploughs” and half of his lands and tenements leases out until the fine had been paid in full” and mentions documented evidence of a local record of 1323 in which Walter gave to the Church “an acre of land with Buildings on St Catherine’s Down”. On this site was built the famous ‘St Catherine’s Oratory’ with the tower which served as a lighthouse for centuries and still stands today.
 
QUESTION: do you know where I might find or access records, copies or transcripts of actions taken relating to the fine, the distraining action, the payment and relaxation of this sentence?
 
The Saint Mary stories also mention how a Papal court was involved by a monastery from Picardy for whom the lost goods of the Saint Mary were presumably intended, and as a result de Godeton was threatened with excommunication unless he  built what we now know as St. Catherine's Oratory, and also “to provide a 'chaunting priest' and to establish 'a light for the benefit of mariners, to be lit every night for ever'” [https://www.pharology.eu/history/britishisles/BR02_eccliasticallights.html]
 
QUESTION: do you know where I might find or access records, copies or transcripts of actions taken relating to the papal court action and perhaps how it played out with respect to local Church courts (eg how does the “acre of land with Buildings on St Catherine’s Down” fit into the various sentences imposed on de Godeton)? [I did wonder if the Quarr Abbey library might be a place to start?]

 I  am sorry for my slowness in giving you a full reply. We are down to a single member of staff rather than our usual team of four due to redeployments in this lockdown.
I have now had a chance to look at some of the references cited in the links that you have provided. I think that there is very little here that is going to get you close to the original sources, but I hope that there may be a few leads that will prove of use
Sir Richard Worsley in his History of the Isle of Wight of 1781 refers to one source as Reg Winton 1323 and later to the fact that it was already a hermitage in 1312 quoting from a register for the diocese of Winchester. Both of these references will presumably lead to items at the Hampshire Record Office, in the records of that diocese. My colleagues at that office may be able to suggest how to get closer to the source through their finding aids. There is a useful on-line catalogue that is searchable and it may be worth looking at that.
The majority of the sources quoted in the Shipwreck Index of the Isle of Wight relate to the Calendars of Patent Rolls at the National Archive, which you have already had access to. There are some secondary sources that we hold here which are referred to, including an article on the wreck of the Blessed Mary (TPT 75) and books such as the volumes on shipwrecks and the Back of Wight by Fred Mew, Ken Phillips and John Medland.
S F Hockey in Insula Vecta (1982) deals with the topic rather briefly. “The little that is known about the oratory and its origin is soon told. The episcopal licence of 15 October 1312 to repair the hermitage for divine worship in the chapel seems to indicate that it was not a question of a new foundation, though there is no earlier allusion to its existence, nor any name of a priest or hermit residing at the oratory. Obviously the little chapel had never been sufficiently endowed. Later, it was granted to Barton oratory, for the maintenance of the divine office and the light by night.” There are two references given in this passage. The first is to the episcopal licence and is “Reg Woodlock p589”. Woodlock is a bishop of Winchester and so this is the same 1312 reference as above I think. The second reference to the grant to Baton Oratory cites Winchester College Muniments (WCM3689). Access to this item is now through the Hampshire Record Office.
So sadly I don’t think that there are any sources at this office that would help you. I would assume that if there were any full court transcripts these would have been used by now. It was, as I understand it usual for records to record the outcome of court business rather than keep a record of the evidence. However if anything survived then I suspect that it was more likely to have been dealt with through a diocesan court rather than through an abbey.
We don’t have any on-line sequence of maps along the lines of the ones that you have shared. We do have some images that might be scannable from the Ordnance Survey editions and from 18th century maps such as that for Andrews, and some of these might be scannable. Is there a particular part of the haven that you are interested in, or is it the shape of the whole inlet that is of interest

The Undercliff Of The Isle Of Wight Past And Present
by Whitehead, John L. 1911 p327 Chapter XII
OF LIGHTHOUSES—WRECKS OF THE SEA, SMUGGLING, Etc. The southern coast of the Isle of Wight must always have been very dangerous to mariners, owing to the conformation of the coast line, the many hidden reef.s, and the existence of strong currents—** The high
lands of St. Albans, in Dorsetshire, and St. Catherine’s Point, in the
Isle of Wight, form a great bay, and in blowing weather, with the wind
to the south-west, hardly any vessel that gets within it escapes without
coming ashore. Numerous stories arc told of the shipwrecks that have taken place
off this coast, and a winter seldom passed without a number of vessels being wrecked in Chale Bay.
The earliest intimation of any preventive measures having been taken
to provide a light for warning ships from approaching too near to the dangerous coast off St. Catherine’s Point is given in the Winchester
register of Bishop Woodlock. It records the admission of one Walter
de Langeberewe to the hermitorium situated on the top of Chale Down : ** dominum Walterum de Langeberewe ad hermitorium super Montem de Chale in insula Vecta nostrae diocesis in honore Sanctae Katerinae Virginis construendum et reparandum, quantum in nobis est, admisimus et quod in capella ibidem construenda divinia celebrare poterit, etc., i d. Oct. 1312.” [Google translate: *Calah, upon the Mount of the lord Walter de Langeberewe in the Isle of Wight to the Hermitorium of our diocese, generously conferred in honor of the Holy Virgin, for building and repair, as far as in us lies, that are to be built in the same place in the chapel of the divine and what is admitted to be able to celebrate the*] 2 “It is thus manifest,’’ writes the Rev. Charles Cox, “that a hermitage existed on the high grounds of Chale prior to 1312. It is impossible to say and idle to conjecture for how long before this date a hermitage and chapel, with a beacon light attached to it, had
existed on these lonely downs; but it .seems clear that one had existed here sufficiently long to require rebuilding, and that it had been endowed
by a pious founder with some slender stipend. Had it been a mere
hermitage dependent on alms the entry would not have appeared in this form in the diocesan register. Had it at that date been first endowed, some record of the founder, however brief, would doubtless have appeared.
Two years elapse ere the next phase relating to the primitive light thus referred to is entered upon and is connected with a shipwreck
occurring off this coast. The story runs that a ship of Bayonne
freighted with white wines of the duchy of Acquitaine sailing to the
^ Pennants, I. of W.^ vol. ii, p. 188. * Cox, County Churches /. of IF., p. 76. Woodlock Bishop, Wynton
coast of Flanders, was wrecked on the hidden reef known as Atherfield Ledge in Chale Bay. Many of the sailors, however, escaped and came
ashore. What then occurred is not clear. The story goes that certain persons would appear to have conspired together to dispute the ownership of the wines, with the result that one, Remigius de Depe, the claimant, was lodged in Winchester Gaol to await his trial. The particulars appear on a Patent Roll, 7 Edward II : — ^
i3i3> ** Association of John Randolph, with Thomas de Warblinton,
July 24. John de Grymstede, and John le Flemyng, in a Commission of Westminster, oyer and terminer issued touching a complaint by Elcas Biger, Frederick Campanare, and Bernard de Columers, merchants
of the Duchy of [Aquitaine]. They had freighted a ship called the St. Mary
of Bayonne, with 174 tuns of white wine at the town of Tormay, on the river Charrante^ in Poitou, for conveyance to England, and on the voyage the vessel was driven ashore on the coast of the Isle of Wight, where the wine was seized as * wreck of sea * by divers men of the county of Southampton, notwithstand- ing that many of the mariners escaped alive to the land.’* 1 The other side of the story is related ten months later in the same
series of Rolls :
—
1314. “ Commission of Oyer and Terminer to Master John de Everesdon May 26. and John de Westecote, on complaint by John Besecu that, whereas
Newcastle- a ship of Remigius de Depe, merchant of Bayonne, freighted with
on-Tyne. white wines in the duchy of [Aquitaine] to be carried to the ports
of Flanders by the said Remigius de Depe and his men, was driven ashore by tempest near Chale, in the Isle of Wight, and wrecked, by which
a great part of the wine was endangered, and the said Remigius de Depe proved
that the ship and wines were his, and afterwards obtained that proof and made
his profit therein. Robert de Harslade, John le Walshe, and Reynum Arnold having made a plot to injure him and conspired with certain others, at Newport, in the same island, that Elias Byger, Fretheric de Campane and Bernard
de Columeners, unknown men, should lay claim to the ship and wines, and that the said John Besecu should be indicted of having committed a theft of the wines from them, as if the wines had been their property when they were not, and as if Remigius de Depe had not proved that the ship and wines were his
;
procured his capture and detention for a long time, in prison at Winchester,
until according to the law and custom of the realm he was acquitted : The
justices are to enquire fully into these allegations, by oath of good men of the county of Southampton.”
2
In the meantime the 174 casks of wine had been sdd, and since each
cask was valued at five marks (a mark’s value was 13s. 4^.) the amount
taken was considerable. With reference to the allegation that the wine was seized as “ wreck of the sea ” b5PBivers men of the county, it may
be said, in explanation thereof, that from the earliest times lords of manors abutting on the sea front claimed “ wreck of sea ” as belonging
to them. Sir Thomas Langford, having leased out his manoV of Chale.
specially reserved the rights and emoluments coming from this source.^
It was shown, however, at the inquiry, that the cargo formed no
” wreck of the sea.” Further particulars appear in the Abbreviation
of Pleas, 8 Edward II, giving an abstract of the pleadings in the King’s
Bench :
—

**l
It appears, therefore, that Walter de Godeton and other local land- owners were involved, either in the seizure or by purchasing the wine.
Ultimately the jurors returned a verdict to the effect that since Walter,
with others, had unlawfully received fifty-three casks of the wine, they
must pay for them the sum of 227^ marks, etc. Here the matter
should have terminated, but, ' inasmuch as the wine appears to have
belonged to a religious community—the monastery of Livers, in Picardy,
a further charge of sacrilege was preferred against De Godeton. For
his misdeeds it is stated that he was threatened by the Pope with
divers pains and penalties. In expiation, and as a token of contrition,
he was ordered to build, on the down above the scene of the disaster, a lighthouse to warn ships off the dangerous coast, and further to assign certain rents for a chaunting priest to sing masses for the repose
of the souls of Walter, his ancestors, and those lost at sea. A further record appears in the Winchester registers of Bishop
Stratford, having reference to the foregoing. “In a communication to the Archdeacon of the Isle of Wight, the Bishop mentions the fact that Walter de Godston (Godeton) had assigned certain rents for the sustentation of the oratory on Chalc Downs, for the maintaining of a clear
light on every night on those dangerous parts of the sea-board, whereby
divers perils to those navigating the seas might be avoided, and also provided a sufficient endowment for the other uses of the oratory. ”3
The writer goes on to discuss the surmise as to there being “ two small establishments on^ these desolate downs, the one a hermitage and the other this lighthouse and oratory of Godeton \s founding, both dedicated
to St. Catherine. Having seen the original entries, and having studied
at first hand the entries as to hermitages in a score of cases in the early
diocesan records, Mr. Cox says : —“ There is no doubt whatever that the 1328 entry refers to the same establishment as that of 1312, and
that Walter de Godeton reconstructed the lighthouse and oratory, putting
the endowment on a more satisfactory footing. A hermitage of mediaeval England differed in toto from an ankcrhold or dwelling for a recluse. I know of no case,” he adds, “ of a hermitage where the hermit had not some definite practical work assigned to him, the repair
of a bridge, the mending of a causeway leading thereto, or the guarding
of a ford. ”3

These duties were performed and the light continued to shine till the Reformation when at the dissolution of the chantries, temp, Henry VIII,
the prayers of the priest, and the more efficacious security derived from
the light-house, were involved in one common ruin, and both light and
chantry disappeared. It was perhaps found impracticable to divide the
useful from the superstitious part of the foundation, so that the whole
fell together, the chantry involving the primitive light-house in its gain.
Neither of them was ever restored, yet the little tower, still called St. Catherine’s, survived and continued to serve as a guide to mariners
by day. * Of the building erected by Walter de (lodyton the foundations only
remain. These were excavated, in 1757, by Sir Richard Worsley, and
the foriii of the chapel was disclosed. The tower of the chapel stood at the west end, having four distinct storeys, and was 35ft. 6in. high,
octangular without and quadrangular within, finished with a pyramidal
roof, each side, interior as well as exterior, being four feet square. “ The lower part was perhaps used as a belfry to the chapel of the Hermitage. Its upper story was evidently constructed as a lighthouse
for the direction of mariners. It is of plain, but neat masonry. Just beneath the roof it is pierced with eight small windows, whose openings
diminish inwards, and all tend to the centre of the building. This construction, which would have been ill calculated for the admission of light
from without, is perfectly well contrived for its diffusion from within.”
The tower—towards the close of the i8th century—was again put into a state of thorough repair, so that it appears capable of withstanding,
for another century, the stormy blasts which rage at this elevation. Worsley speaks of the priests’ little cell, being found at the south-west corner close to the tower. Mr. Percy Stone, in his excavations under- taken in 2891, says he could find no trace of it, so must conclude Worsley was wrong in his bearings, and meant the walls of the oratory, which
I successfully uncovered without finding anything of interest beyond the mere foundations.^ The tower stood on the summit of St. Catherine’s Down, 782 feet above sea level. “ When standing on this airy summit it is impossible not to picture to the mind the venerable inhabitant of this cell lifted almost out of the habitable world, and only recalled to it by the charitable care of his friendly lamp ; mingling hfr nightly orisons with the howling
of the storm, and pouring forth prayers for the safety of those whose
anxious eyes were strained with watching for its welcome ray, twinkling
by fits through the sweeping clouds.” ' “ The view from the hill,” writes Mr. Thorne {The Land we live in), “is of wondrous extent, reaching over, by far the larger part of the
island, and including the New Forest, the hills of Hampshire, and the south coast as far as Beachy Head.”

Roll, under date July 26th, 1352 :
—
1352. The King appointed William de Ryngebourn, Theobald de
July 26. Gorges, and John de Kyngesdon, to take an inquisition and it is found that a manor called Hale was lately half a Knight’s fee, that William de Godyton now held it entire of the manor of Gatecombe in demesne
. . .^hat the manor was not divided after the death of William de Hale and that^ichard atte Hale held the messuage and land of Robert de Godyton by
the service of a fourth part of a Knight’s fee,” etc.l The m^nor of Godyton is found under its modern name of ” Gotten,”
as a farm situated on the north-east slope of Chale Down. In 1780 the Trinity Board, recognising the value of the ancient tower as a landmark,
and desiring to re-establish the light, substantially repaired the tower,
and, at an expense of ;^7,ooo, erected another pharos by its side. This
light was soon found to be useless in bad weather when most wanted,
for the high hills are almost always enveloped in clouds, and of course
the Ian thorns invisible at any little distance. Pennant, from whom
the quotation is taken, mentions that ” From mistaking this light for the Portland lights, a Dutch frigate of 36 guns and 250 men came bump ashore and was beat to pieces, and though most of the crew were
saved at last, the surf ran so high it was one night and two days before they could be brought off.” ” I was,” he adds, ” the means of saving
eight men, by bribing a desperate smuggler to go off to them in his boat. ”2

GOTTEN
GOTTEN (Gadetune, xi cent.; Godeton, xiv cent.), now only a small farm-house, was held before the Conquest by a certain Bruning and his brother, but belonged in 1086 to William son of Stur. (fn. 47) The overlordship passed like Gatcombe (q.v.) to the descendants of William son of Stur, being held in the 13th century as part of a fee in Whitefield (fn. 48) and Gotten, &c., of Maud de Estur, lady of Gatcombe. (fn. 49)
In the 13th and 14th centuries the intermediate tenants of Gotten were the lords of Whitefield (q.v.), the Tracy family, who held the above fee, (fn. 50) while the intermediate tenants who held Gotten of the lords of Whitfield for one-twelfth of a knight's fee were the family of Goditon or Gotton, who were also holding Southale in Hale (fn. 51) (q.v.). Thus in about 1305 William de Goditon or Gotton died seised of a tenement in Gotton, held as above, and was succeeded by his son Robert, (fn. 52) and from this date it appears that Gotton descended like Southale in Hale (q.v.), being possibly merged in the same. In the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries estates in both Hale and Gotton were in possession of the Oglander family, that in Gotton being termed half the manor of Gotton. (fn. 53) This estate seems subsequently to have been acquired by the lord of Chale and annexed to that manor.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flotsam,_jetsam,_lagan_and_derelict
In terms of maritime law, the definition of flotsam pertains to goods that are floating on the surface of the water as the result of a wreck or an accident. As there is no clear way of defining ownership, one who discovers flotsam is allowed to claim it, unless someone claims ownership to the items in question.
Jetsam  designates any cargo that is intentionally discarded from a ship or wreckage. Legally jetsam also floats, although floating is not part of the etymological meaning.[8] Generally, "jettisoning" connotes the action of throwing goods overboard to lighten the load of the ship if it is in danger of sinking.Per maritime law, one who discovers these artifacts is not required to return them to their rightful owner except in the case that the latter makes a legally abiding claim

[https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/flotsam-jetsam.html Flotsam may be claimed by the original owner, whereas jetsam may be claimed as property of whoever discovers it.]
Lagan  (also called "ligan") refers to goods that are cast overboard and are heavy enough to sink to the ocean floor, but are tied or otherwise linked to a floating marker, such as a buoy or cork, so that they can be found again by whoever marked the item. Lagan can also refer to large objects that are trapped within the sinking vessel. According to maritime law, a buoy, or otherwise floating object, constitutes as sufficient grounds in laying claim to an artifact. In other words, when faced with a lagan, one is required to return the artifact to its rightful owner
Derelict can refer to goods that have sunk to the ocean floor, relinquished willingly or forcefully by its owner, and thus abandoned, but which no one has any hope of reclaiming.In terms of maritime law, derelict is considered property abandoned on navigable waters which has no hope of being recovered, or sine spe recuperandi, and no expectation of it being returned to its owner

Shipwrecks were both good news and bad news, bad for the sailors and their families, but good for the people who lived nearby and who could benefit from salvage of the cargoes. Such windfalls often meant the difference between comfort and despair in lean times. Once seamen came to depend upon certain lights being shown, it was only a matter of time before unscrupulous rogues showed false lights to lure ships onto deadly rocks. The Cornish coasts, in particular, hold many secrets of wreckers and their deadly games. In the 14th century, piracy at the Bell Rock in Scotland is the focus of a tale in which a warning bell was established on the dangerous rock by the Abbot of Arbroath, but removed by the pirate to further his own evil ends. It is said that he perished a year later when his ship struck the same rocks because there was no longer a warning.
From medieval times to the beginning of the 17th century, the safety of seamen, which included showing lights, was a task that often fell to the caring people of the church. Indeed, the majority of early maritime lights were of ecclesiastical origin. One of the first recorded lights, established by a religious order in the British Isles, was at Hook Head in County Wexford, reputed to be the site where the monks of St. Dubhan established a fire beacon as early as the 5th century. Another report gives 810 as the date of establishment, but there is no doubt that the tower that exists there today is the oldest operational light in any of the four countries – England, Wales, Scotland and Ireland, and dates from 1245. It was reportedly built by the warden and chaplains of the monastery of St. Saviour Rendeuan. A lighthouse is said to have been built at Youghal in 1190 by Maurice Fitzgerald who put it in the care of the nuns of St. Ann's convent, which he endowed. In England, the earliest known light was a harbour light at Winchelsea on the Kent coast, erected about 1261.
Whilst monks may have tended to lights, not all were built by them. St. Catherine's oratory on the Isle of Wight was erected by a rich merchant to fight ex-communication by the Papal church. The merchant, Walter de Godeton, purchased numerous barrels of wine from the local wrecking community at St. Catherine's. Despite the principle of 'Custom and Descent', where salvage from shipwrecks was considered the lawful right of the people, the Pope considered that, because the wine had been destined for the Catholic Church, the salvage was an act of plunder and sacrilegious. In penance to the Church, Walter de Godeton was forced to build St. Catherine's Oratory to provide a 'chaunting priest' and to establish 'a light for the benefit of mariners, to be lit every night for ever'. From 1314 until the dissolution of the monasteries by Henry VIII in 1534, the family of Walter de Godeton kept the oratory lit.


St Catherines oratory https://www.pastscape.org.uk/hob.aspx?hob_id=459794
A medieval lighthouse forming the west tower of an oratory, and the remains of the oratory, set within a medieval enclosure on St Catherine's Hill. The lighthouse survives as a stone tower (known as the Pepperpot), octagonal on the outside and square within, originally consisting of four stories. Eight windows on the third floor form the lantern. The lighthouse, which formed the western tower of the oratory, is all that survives of the original building. However, the remains of the walls are visible as earthworks forming three sides of a square with the lighthouse on the open, west side. The oratory walls are about 12 metres apart and survive to a height of one metre. Partial excavations in 1891 revealed the building plan. The lighthouse was completed by 1328. It was built by Walter de Godeton, a local landowner, who was condemned by the Church for stealing casks of wine from a shipwreck which had occurred in 1313 off Chale Bay. The Church threatened de Godeton with excommunication unless he built a lighthouse above the scene of the shipwreck together with an adjoining oratory. The oratory was to be endowed to maintain a priest to tend the light and to say masses for souls lost at sea. These duties were apparently carried out until the Dissolution of the Monasteries. The tower's arched door-heads suggest it was substantially repaired in the mid 16th century, possibly with the threat of the Spanish Armada. Surrounding the lighthouse and oratory on their north, west and south sides is a bank about 0.5 metres high and 5 metres wide, the fourth side likely to have been levelled by cultivation. The oratory is a Scheduled Ancient Monument, is listed Grade II, and is in the care of English Heritage.

The monument known locally as 'the pepper pot' is a mediaeval oratory and pharos, a lighthouse, built near the summit (800 ft) of St Catherine Down above Chale Abbey, i.It is known that an hermitage existed on the site previous to 1312 because the Bishop of Winchester, Bishop Woodlock 2 issued a licence* on 4th. October 1312:
".. domimm Walterum-de Langeberewe " [longbarraw ] (Langstrellgiven in Tomkins) ad hermitorium super mantem de Chale in Insula Vecta nostrae dioceses in honore Santa Katerinae Virginis construendum et reparendum., quantum in nobis est, admisimus et quod in capell ibidem cowtruende divinia celebrare poterit... "
*'His permission to build the lighthouse and perform divine service'
The light was provided from a blazing brazir within but it was useless to mariners.
Two years later one stormy night in 1314 a vessel, the ' Mary of Bayonne', laden with 174 tuns (barrels) of white wine foundered in Atherfield Bay. She was part of a fleet belonging to some merchants of the King's Duchy of Aquitaine all carrying wine, loaded in Tormay, on the River Charrante in Poitou to England. The wine was consumed by the locals or sold as 'wrecks of the sea' 3 but the owners took action to recover their loss in the King's Court-Malefactiones de Comittatu de Suthanton 4 [4. Abbrev. Placitor, Hilary 8 Edward II AD 1315] mentioning one Walter de Godeton. His defence that he had bought the wine in good faith from the survivors of the wreck was successful in spite of the fact that as 'Flotsam' it still belonged to the shippers. Another jury however found the Islanders to blame and they had to pay for 53 casks of wine some 227Vi marks. 5 [Abbrev. Placitor, Hilary 20 Edward II AD 1327.] The Church were not satisfied with this as the wine was said to belong to the Monastery of Livers in Picardy so they then took action in a Papal Court and a Bull was issued ordering Walter, in reparation and expiation, 'to make good their losses and build the present oratory and lighthouse in penance or to prevent further shipwreck'; (see Percy Stone p28. Vol. n.). A visit to the tower was recorded in the 'Gentleman's Magazine' 6 [Gentleman's Magazine. Vol. xxvii .1757.] Percy Stone thought that the anchorite's chapel and the oratory were different buildings. Both were dedicated to St Catherine but she was patron saint of hills.

p332, 333 Worsley on rights of lord to wreck "revenue of wrecks"


Via http://www.invectis.co.uk/iow/wl_ventnor.html#scd,  Percy Stone, in his Architectural Antiquities of the Isle of Wight, gives some interesting particulars. A hermitage appears to have been founded here early in the fourteenth century: "Three years after the foundation of this isolated chapel a circumstance occurred . . . explaining very clearly the raison d'être of the still existing lighthouse. One stormy night in the winter of A.D. 1314, a vessel- one of a fleet chartered by sundry merchants of the King's Duchy of Aquitaine to convey a large consignment of white wine to England- drove ashore on Atherfield Ledge. The sailors escaped . . . and sold the cargo to the Island folk- 174 casks of wine, each worth five marks. The merchants took proceedings against the receivers of the stolen cargo, for it clearly did not belong to the sailors, who were, however, apparently not deemed worth prosecuting, even if they could have been traced. One Island landowner, Walter de Godeton, was found guilty of receiving 53 casks and had to pay 2271/2 marks. But another party besides the merchants had to be reckoned with, namely, the Church; for the wine, it appeared, belonged to the religious community of Livers, in Picardy, who had lodged a complaint against de Codeton in the Roman Court. This resulted in the culprit having to build, on the Down above the scene of the disaster, a lighthouse to warn ships, and to found an oratory for a priest to say masses for the souls of those lost at sea, and to trim the light. De Codeton, before 1328, did as he was required, and the existing ruin, repaired at the end of the eighteenth century, is the relic of his work."

https://www.gottenmanor.co.uk/history/ Gotten seems to have been inhabited for a least a thousand years, originating probably as an early Jutish settlement with the name of Godyngton.
[NOT LORD IF MANOR OF CHALE  https://www.british-history.ac.uk/vch/hants/vol5/pp235-240 ]

By 1066 it was held by two brothers called Bruning , as recorded in the Domesday Book. Under the Normans it passed to William, son of Stur and is described with the name of Gadetune as comprising one hide (about 120 acres), worked by two brothers (smallholders) and valued at 20 shillings (Domesday).
No local record is available until 1250 when Adam de Godeton received the grant of “a dwelling with half a acre of ground”. Other grants and rents followed notably in 1275 “half a pound of cumin seed as annual rent”. By the 14th century, “the intermediate tenants of Gotten from the Lords of Whitefield were the Family of Goditon”. (Victoria County History).
In about 1305 came the first official description of Gotten Manor, in an inquest report on the death of William de Goditon and the succession of his son Robert.
It describes “the tenement being extended as a Hall, a Grange, an Oxstall, with half an acre of Garden, a Dovecot, 30 acres of Arable, 20 acres of Pasture and one Free Tenant rendering 12 pence per annum”.(Inqu.p.m. 33Edw.I, No.39)
In 1313 the holder of Gotten was a Walter de Goditon who became involved in a notorious shipwreck in Chale. The ‘Ship of the Blessed Mary’ carrying cargo of white wine from Aquitaine to England, was driven ashore by a gale and the owners claimed that most of the 174 casks of white wine were removed from the beaches by local men. As these owners came from Gascony, which then belonged to England, King Edward II was obliges to arraign the accused men, chief of whom was Walter!
After a long trial, culminating at Westminster, he was fined so heavily that all his goods had to be distrained, “except the horses and oxen of his ploughs” and half of his lands and tenements leases out until the fine of 287 and a half marks had been paid in full. Many stories have been woven around this case but the only documented evidence is a local record of 1323 that Walter gave to the Church “an acre of land with Buildings on St Catherine’s Down”. On this site was built the famous ‘St Catherine’s Oratory’ with the tower which served as a lighthouse for centuries and still stands today.

The Pepper Pot's Construction
In April 1313 the merchant ship St Marie of Bayonne, carrying the finest quality wine from Tonnay in the Aquitaine region of France, ran aground on Atherfield Ledge in Chale Bay. All the sailors survived and the local Islanders salvaged the wine. However all 174 casks of wine soon disappeared, with Lord Walter de Godeton3 of nearby Chale Manor caught plundering it. De Godeton was charged with illegally receiving the casks and was fined 227.5 marks. There the matter might have ended, had the wine not belonged to the monastery of Livers in Picardy, who appealed to the Pope.
The Pope declared that taking church wine was sacrilege and summoned de Godeton to the ecclesiastical court in Rome. The Pope told him that he would be excommunicated from the church and his soul would be damned to burn in Hell for all eternity. The only way to avoid such a fate would be by atoning for his sin by building a lighthouse on top of Chale Down to prevent any more shipwrecks, near the oratory to St Catherine of Alexandria4. As well as constructing the lighthouse, de Godeton should bequeath money to finance a priest to pray for the souls of those at sea. This de Godeton did, finishing the lighthouse by 13285.
St Catherine's Lighthouse
After St Catherine's Oratory was abandoned, Chale Bay witnessed shipwrecks so frequently, it had become known locally as the Bay of Death. Sixty ships sank in the area between 1746 and 1808. However it took the most infamous shipwreck of the Island's shore before anything more was done. The wreck was the Clarendon, a three-masted ship with a crew of 16 and 10 passengers including five young girls and two women, which was driven to the shoals of Blackgang Chine during a fierce storm. Locals managed to rescue three of the sailors on board, but the broken bodies of the remaining 13 sailors and ten passengers (including the seven females), clothes ripped off by the force of the storm, were later swept to shore. All but one of the bodies came ashore at Chale, where they were buried. The remaining body, that of a Miss Gourley, was carried by the water and came to rest at Southsea, at the foot of her father's garden.
Trinity House, given responsibility for lighthouses by an Act of Parliament in 1836, was swamped with demands for a lighthouse to be built at St Catherine's Point to help prevent further disasters. The new lighthouse was therefore built a little over a mile (2km) from St Catherine's Oratory in a position closer to the sea, overlooking St Catherine's Point, lower down on the Undercliff, west of the village of Niton. James Walker designed the lighthouse as a three-tiered octagonal tower, built 1838 - 40. It was originally much higher than today, and 94 steps led from the ground to the lantern room. The elevation of the light proved to be too high, as the lantern frequently became mist-capped and in 1875 it was decided to lower the light by 13m. This was achieved by taking roughly 6m out of the uppermost section and about 7m out of the middle. Doing this, though, destroyed its beauty and gave it a dwarfed appearance, but it meant that the tower was more effective.
In 1868 St Catherine's Lighthouse had a fog signal house constructed to help warn of the danger, with its own lighthouse keeper. By the early 20th Century this had eroded over the cliff and so in 1932 a second lighthouse tower housing the foghorn equipment was constructed adjoining the tower in the same style. This warned of the danger until 1987, when the foghorn was replaced with a radio beacon transmitter. The two towers have been nicknamed, with the lighthouse called 'The Cow' and the foghorn tower 'the Calf'.

https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/st-catherines-down-and-knowles-farm/features/a-colourful-history-behind-st-catherines-oratory Built in the 14th century, high on a hill overlooking Chale Bay on the Isle of Wight, St Catherine’s Oratory is the stuff of colourful legend involving the Lord of the Manor. Known locally as the ‘Pepperpot’, we look after all that remains of the Oratory in partnership with English Heritage. Plunder and punishment In 1313, a ship (the St Mary of Bayonne) was blown off-course and ran aground on the treacherous Atherfield Ledge in Chale Bay. Its cargo of white wine, destined for a French monastery, was sold illegally by the sailors to local people. Many barrels found their way into the cellars of Walter de Godeton, Lord of the Manor of Chale. The ship came from Gascony, part of King Edward II’s kingdom. The incident was brought to his notice and Walter de Godeton appeared before an ecclesiastical court and was heavily fined. Penitent and priest Unfortunately for de Godeton, the Pope heard of the incident and, to avoid excommunication, de Godeton was ordered to build an oratory and beacon on Chale Down (now St Catherine’s Hill) as penance. A priest would tend the light to guide ships and say prayers for the souls of the drowned – at de Godeton’s expense. However, there is a record of repairs needed to a chapel in 1312, before the shipwreck. So it may be that de Godeton was simply ordered to provide a more substantial endowment for the existing chapel. St Catherine’s Oratory is often referred to as the finest surviving example of a medieval lighthouse in Britain. In reality, it's more likely to have been a bell tower with a beacon alongside. It fell into disrepair in the 16th century following the dissolution of the monasteries and was abandoned. The octagonal tower survived because of its importance as a seamark.




https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Catherine%27s_Point
St Catherine's Point is the southernmost point on the Isle of Wight. It is close to the village of Niton and the point where the Back of the Wight changes to the Undercliff of Ventnor.
On nearby St Catherine's Down is St Catherine's Oratory, locally known as the "Pepperpot", a stone lighthouse built in the 1323 by Walter De Godeton. It is Britain's oldest medieval lighthouse.[1]



https://www.english-heritage.org.uk/visit/places/st-catherines-oratory/history/ It is likely that the oratory, completed in 1328, was erected by Walter de Godeton, a local landowner who was condemned by the Church for stealing casks of wine from a shipwreck which had occurred in 1314 off Chale Bay.
The ship was one of a fleet carrying a cargo of white wine for the monastery of Livers in Picardy. The Church threatened de Godeton with excommunication unless he built a lighthouse above the scene of the shipwreck, together with an adjoining oratory.
The oratory was to be endowed to maintain a priest to tend the light and to say masses for souls lost at sea. The duties were apparently carried out until the Reformation in the 16th century.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Catherine%27s_Oratory It is Britain's only surviving medieval lighthouse, and the second oldest (only the Roman lighthouse at Dover being older). It is a stone structure four stories high, octagonal on the outside and four-sided on the inside, originally attached to the west side of a building; remnants of three other walls are visible. ... de Godeton was tried for theft in Southampton, before a jury from the island, and fined 287 and half marks on 27 February 1314. However, he was also later tried by the Church courts, since the wine had been destined for the monastery of Livers in Picardy. The Church threatened to excommunicate him unless he built a lighthouse near Chale Bay.



The Undercliff, Whitehead
p327-9
Two years elapse ere the next phase relating to the primitive light thus referred to is entered upon and is connected with a shipwreck occurring off this coast. The story runs that a ship of Bayonne freighted with white wines of the duchy of Acquitaine sailing to the
coast of Flanders, was wrecked on the hidden reef known as Atherfield LedgeinChaleBay. Manyofthesailors,however,escapedandcame ashore. What then occurred is not clear. The story goes that certain persons would appear to have conspired together to dispute the owner- ship of the wines, with the result that one, Remigius de Depe, the claimant, was lodged in Winchester Gaol to await his trial. The par-
ticulars appear on a Patent Roll, 7 Edward II : — ^
i3i3> ** Association of John Randolph, with Thomas de Warblinton, July 24. John de Grymstede, and John le Flemyng, in a Commission of Westminster, oyer and terminer issued touching a complaint by Elcas Biger, Frederick Campanare, and Bernard de Columers, merchants of the Duchy of [Aquitaine]. They had freighted a ship called the St. Mary of Bayonne, with 174 tuns of white wine at the town of Tormay, on the river Charrante^ in Poitou, for conveyance to England, and on the voyage the vessel was driven ashore on the coast of the Isle of Wight, where the wine was seized as * wreck of sea * by divers men of the county of Southampton, notwithstand-
ing that many of the mariners escaped alive to the land.’* 1
The other side of the story is related ten months later in the same series of Rolls :
1314. “ Commission of Oyer and Terminer to Master John de Everesdon May 26. and John de Westecote, on complaint by John Besecu that, whereas Newcastle- a ship of Remigius de Depe, merchant of Bayonne, freighted with on-Tyne. white wines in the duchy of [Aquitaine] to be carried to the ports of Flanders by the said Remigius de Depe and his men, was driven ashore by tempest near Chale, in the Isle of Wight, and wrecked, by which a great part of the wine was endangered, and the said Remigius de Depe proved that the ship and wines were his, and afterwards obtained that proof and made his profit therein. Robert de Harslade, John le Walshe, and Reynum Arnold having made a plot to injure him and conspired with certain others, at New- port, in the same island, that Elias Byger, Fretheric de Campane and Bernard de Columeners, unknown men, should lay claim to the ship and wines, and that the said John Besecu should be indicted of having committed a theft of the wines from them, as if the wines had been their property when they were not,
and as if Remigius de Depe had not proved that the ship and wines were his procured his capture and detention for a long time, in prison at Winchester, until according to the law and custom of the realm he was acquitted : The justices are to enquire fully into these allegations, by oath of good men of the county of Southampton.”
In the meantime the 174 casks of wine had been sdd, and since each cask was valued at five marks (a mark’s value was 13s. 4^.) the amount taken was considerable. With reference to the allegation that the wine was seized as “ wreck of the sea ” b5PBivers men of the county, it may be said, in explanation thereof, that from the earliest times lords of manors abutting on the sea front claimed “ wreck of sea ” as belonging tothem. SirThomasLangford,havingleasedouthismanoVofChale. specially reserved the rights and emoluments coming from this source.^ It was shown, however, at the inquiry, that the cargo formed no ” wreck of the sea.” Further particulars appear in the Abbreviation of Pleas, 8 Edward II, giving an abstract of the pleadings in the King’s Bench :

It appears, therefore, that Walter de Godeton and other local land-
owners were involved, either in the seizure or by purchasing the wine. Ultimately the jurors returned a verdict to the effect that since Walter, with others, had unlawfully received fifty-three casks of the wine, they must pay for them the sum of 227^ marks, etc. Here the matter should have terminated, but, ' inasmuch as the wine appears to have belonged to a religious community—the monastery of Livers, in Picardy, a further charge of sacrilege was preferred against De Godeton. For his misdeeds it is stated that he was threatened by the Pope with divers pains and penalties. In expiation, and as a token of contrition, he was ordered to build, on the down above the scene of the disaster, a lighthouse to warn ships off the dangerous coast, and further to assign certain rents for a chaunting priest to sing masses for the repose
of the souls of Walter, his ancestors, and those lost at sea.
A further record appears in the Winchester registers of Bishop Stratford, having reference to the foregoing. “In a communication to the Archdeacon of the Isle of Wight, the Bishop mentions the fact that Walter de Godston (Godeton) had assigned certain rents for the sustenta- tion of the oratory on Chalc Downs, for the maintaining of a clear light on every night on those dangerous parts of the sea-board, whereby divers perils to those navigating the seas might be avoided, and also provided a sufficient endowment for the other uses of the oratory.”3 The writer goes on to discuss the surmise as to there being “ two small establishments on^these desolate downs, the one a hermitage and the
other this lighthouse and oratory of Godeton \s founding, both dedicated to St. Catherine. Having seen the original entries, and having studied at first hand the entries as to hermitages in a score of cases in the early
—
diocesan records, Mr. Cox says : “ There is no doubt whatever that
the 1328 entry refers to the same establishment as that of 1312, and that Walter de Godeton reconstructed the lighthouse and oratory, putting the endowment on a more satisfactory footing. A hermitage of mediaeval England differed in toto from an ankcrhold or dwelling for a recluse. I know of no case,” he adds, “ of a hermitage where the hermit had not some definite practical work assigned to him, the repair of a bridge, the mending of a causeway leading thereto, or the guarding of a ford. ”3

Of the building erected by Walter de (lodyton the foundations only
remain. These were excavated, in 1757, by Sir Richard Worsley, and the foriii of the chapel was disclosed. The tower of the chapel stood at the west end, having four distinct storeys, and was 35ft. 6in. high, octangular without and quadrangular within, finished with a pyramidal roof, each side, interior as well as exterior, being four feet square. “ The lower part was perhaps used as a belfry to the chapel of the Hermitage. Its upper story was evidently constructed as a lighthouse for the direction of mariners. It is of plain, but neat masonry. Just beneath the roof it is pierced with eight small windows, whose openings diminish inwards, and all tend to the centre of the building. This con- struction, which would have been ill calculated for the admission of light from without, is perfectly well contrived for its diffusion from within.” The tower—towards the close of the i8th century—was again put into a state of thorough repair, so that it appears capable of withstanding, for another century, the stormy blasts which rage at this elevation. Worsley speaks of the priests’ little cell, being found at the south-west corner close to the tower. Mr. Percy Stone, in his excavations under- taken in 2891, says he could find no trace of it, so must conclude Worsley was wrong in his bearings, and meant the walls of the oratory, which I successfully uncovered without finding anything of interest beyond the mere foundations.^

There is another picturesque circumstance frequently seen on the coasts of the Isle of Wight,whichmaybementioned,thoughitisadreadfulone. Awinter seldom passes in which the inhabitants of these dangerous coasti are
not called together to see some dreadful event (a wreck) of this kind. Long experience has taught them to judge when the mischief is inevit- able. They see that every wave which beats over the perisfiing vessel drives her nearer some reef of rocks, well known to them, though the seaman knows it not; signals can be of no use; yet they make what signals* they can to point out the danger. In a short moment the dreadful crash arrives. The labouring vessel, now beating among the rocks, gives way in every part, and the hospitable islanders, very unlike their neighbours on the Cornish Coast, have nothing left but to do civerything in their power to save the miserable people, and recover what they can from the wreck.”
From the earliest period “ wreck of the sea, waifs and estrays,” pertained to the lordship of the island. At an inquisition taken on the death of Baldwin de Redvers, 47 Henry III (1263), “ the jurors also say that wreck of the sea belonging to the lord of the castle is worth 4A'. per annum.” During the countess Isabella’s tenure the claim was contested by the abbot of Quarr, by John de Insula, owning Bonchurch and other Undercliff estates, by Sir Thomas de Aula, of St. Lawrence, and the lady Matilda de Estur, of Old Park, in Whitwell parish, on the plea that each of them was entitled to one-half of whatever should be wrecked on their respective lands, as a compensation or salvage for preserving the other half for the use of the lord.” The trial took place before the Justices Itinerant, at Winchester, 8 Edward I (1280), when ” Isabella, countess of Albermarl, was summoned to show to the Lord the King, by what warrant she thus claimed to have wreck of the sea, and Isabella comes and saith that she and all her ancestors, from the time of king Richard, and also before that time alw^ays unto the present time have had their wreck of the sea in her fee of the Isle of Wight without any interruption.” The story is given in Hillier’s unfinished History of the Isle of Wight, and^The jury being chosen, say upon oath, ‘ that the aforesaid Countess and also all he r ancestors, from the time whereof memory doth not exist, had such wreck of sea in her fee,’ etc., and by an order of the Itinerant Justices the rights of the Countess were confirmed.
In 1416, 3 Henry V, is entered the following :
” Edwardus Dux Ebor’.
Insula de Wight et Caresbrok Castr’ infra eundem et totum dominium addict* insulam et castrum pertinens cum wrecco maris. . .
The “ revenue of wrecks ” w'as granted as a royal franchise to lords
of manors, and the Wardens of the Island claimed this privilege.
—
Worsley writes : “ When the Lordship was in Prince Edward, Sir
Henry Tyeys was Warden under him, a petition was exhibited against him to the Parliament by Ralph de Gorges (of Knighton, I. of W.), complaining that he (Sir Henry Tyeys) had defrauded the lord of part of tl^ salvage of a wreck,” etc.' The lords of the manor of Ashey, which included the sub-manor of Knyghton, claimed to have all wrecks of the sea on the north side of the island between Ryde and Binstead, as far beyond low water mark as a man could reach the ground with an oar, i8ft. long, as their property.
The result of the inquiry is entered on a Patent Roll :
1320. ” Commission of Oyer and Terminer to John de Bello Campo of Nov. 15. Somersete (and others), touching the petition, exhibited before Westminster, the King’s Council, of Ralph de Gorges, alleging that divers trespasses and other malpractices under colour of office had been committed as well against the King, Edward, earl of Chester and lord of the Isle of Wight, his son, as against men of the county of Southampton and of the said Island, by Henry le Tyeys and John de Burton and other ministers of the said Henry during the time the same Henry was Constable of the said Island. ”2
And later, in the same series of Rolls, is entered ~
:
1321. ” Grant to Ralph de Gorges, lately taken prisoner while on the
July 2. King's service and ransomed afterwards, of 500 marks towards
Westminster, his ransom, to be received out of the first money accruing from
the ji^iooo by which Henry Tyeys lately made fine for trespasses
against the King, Edward, earl of Chester, in the Isle of Wight of which he
was convicted. . .

As the commerce between the continent and the mainland increased in volume this asset must have become much more valuable. It possibly explains the effort the early manorial lords ceem to have made to secure a sea-frontage on the exposed south side of the Island, however con- tracted the area might be.
The phrase “ flotsam and jetsam ” is often used, but the true mean- ing is not always fully understood. In order to constitute a legal wreck the goods must come to land. If they continue at sea the law distin- guishes them by tHb above terms. “ Jetsam ” is applied where goods are cast into the sea, and there sink and remain under water; “flot- sam,” where the goods continue floating on the surface of the waves, and a third term, “ ligan,” where they are sunk in the sea, but tied to a cork or buoy to be found again, a mode of procedure endeared to the heart of many a bygone smuggler.
The following deed is of interest, as showing that some of the rights claimed by the “ Lords of the Island ” in early days still appertained to the later governorship ;

By the Winchester Registers of Bishop Wooillock, it is evident an aucliorage existed previous to A.D. 1312, as in that year one Walter de Laugeberewe was admitted to tlie hermitoriiim super Montem de Chale .... in honore Saticfce Kateriyue Viryinis constrnewlnm et reparanditm, being licensed to perform Divine service in capplhi ibkletti const rnenda. Three years after the foundation of this isohited chapel a circumstance occurred .... explaining very clearly the raison d'etre of the still existing lighthouse. One stormy night in the winter of A.D. 1314 a vessel—one of a fleet chartered by sundry merchants of the King's Duchy of Aquitaine to convey a large consignment of white wine to England—drove ashoreonAtherfieldLedge. Thesailorsescaped....andsoldthecargotothe Island folk—174 casks of wine each worth five marks. The merchants took proceedings against the receivers of the stolen cargo, for it clearly did not belong to the sailors, who were, however, apparently not deemed worth prosecuting, eveniftheycouldhavebeentraced. OneIslandlandowner,WalterdeGodeton, wasfoundguiltyofreceiving53casks,andhadtopay227^marks. Butanother party besides the merchants had to be reckoned with, namely, the Church, for the wine, it appeared, belonged to the religious community of Livers, in Picardy, who had lodged a complaint against De Godeton in the Roman Court. This resulted in the culprit having to build, on the Down above the scene of the disaster, a lighthouse to warn ships, and to found an oratory for a priest to say masses for the souls of those lost at sea, and to trim the "light. De Godeton before 1328 did as he was required, and the existing ruin, repaired at the end of the 18th century, is the relic of his work.

Mr. JAMES PARKER (treasurer), read two lettire which he had received on behalf of the society. The first letter from Mr. Hodder M. Westropp of Ventnor, Isle of Wight, dated Nov. 13th. It called the attention of the society to a small lighthouse about 7 miles from Ventnor, on St. Catherine Down, which the writer believed to be a *Lanterne des Mortes*, it being in connection with a sepulchral chapel The fanal and chapel were supposed to have been erected in 1323, by Walter de Gixlyton, who endowed the chapel.
