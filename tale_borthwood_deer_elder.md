LEGENDS OF THE ISLE OF WIGHT.

WITH THE ADVENTURES OF THE AUTHOR IN SEARCH OF THEM. BY ABRAHAM ELDER, ESQ.

BORTHWOOD forest was an extensive tract of wild and well-wooded country, lying on this side of Shanklin. You will see, when you pass that way, a singularly-pointed conical hill, with a peasant's cottage perched upon the top of it, rising out of a comparatively level country. It is known to this day by the name of "The Queen's Bower." Its use, and the origin of its name, are as follows:—

It was the custom of our Norman ancestors, when they gave a grand hunting entertainment, to select an open space, as near as might be in the centre of their hunting-ground; and choosing some natural mount, or forming an artificial one, they erected upon it a pavilion, in which were placed the ladies, and such of their company as did not intend personally to take a part in the chase. A large portion of the forest was then surrounded by as many of the chief retainers as could be got together. These advanced in a circle, making a great noise, gradually contracting the area of the circle, until at length all the beasts that they had disturbed were driven into the appointed hunting-ground. Here the knights who had assembled for the chase, lay in wait for them near the openings through which it was probable that the game would issue from the forest. The knights were generally on horseback, armed with bows and arrows, and attended with their squires holding their dogs in leash. As the deer passed, they shot their arrows, and let their dogs loose upon the game, and generally with fatal effect; for skill in every branch of the art of hunting appears to have been the great test of a man's being a gentleman.

The hill still called the Queen's Bower derives its name from the circumstance of Isabella de Fortibus, the lady of the Isle of Wight in the reign of Edward the First, having there erected her hunting-pavilion. This lady, so celebrated in the local history of the island, was sometimes styled the Queen of the Isle of Wight; and, indeed, though feudally subject to the Crown of England, her authority within her own dominions was quite despotic, and she lived in her castle of Carisbrook in a magnificence and state worthy of royalty.

A very curious account of a hunting of this lady, or Queen of the Isle of Wight, in Borthwood forest, is preserved in an ancient manuscript `[Ancient MS. Brit. Mus. Harl. MSS. 2252, 44. Wart. Eng. Poet. vol. i. p. 198.]` in the British Museum. It appears that a certain knight visited her court in disguise; and Isabella, wishing to satisfy her doubts as to whether he was come of noble blood or not, without committing a breach of ancient hospitality by asking him questions, proposes a grand hunting-match, that he might prove his noble breeding by his skill in the chase. The manuscript is as follows: —

"On the morrow, whan yt was day,  
To her men she gan to say,
'To-morrow, whan it is daylight,  
Lok ye be all redy dight,  
With your houndis more and lesse  
In forrest to take my gresse, `[Gresse — game.]`  
And thare I will myself be,  
Your games to beholde and see.'  
Ippomedon had houndis three,  
That he brot from his countree,  
Whan they were to the wood gone,  
This ladye and her men ichone, `[Ichone — each one, i. e. all.]`  
And with hem her houndis ladde, `[Ladde — led.]`  
All that any houndis hadde,  
Syr Tholomew forgate he nought  
His maistres houndis thythere he brought,  
That many a day he had run ere;  
Full well he thought to note hem there.  
Whan they came to the lande on hight,  
The queen's pavylyon there was pight, `[Pight — pitched.]`  
That she might see all the best  
All the game of the forrest;  
And to the ladye brought many a best,  
Herte and hynd, buck and doe,  
And other bestis many mo.  
The houndis that were of gret prise  
Plucked down deer all atryse.  
Ippomedon, he with his houndis throo, `[Three.]`  
Drew down both buck and doo,  
More he took with houndis three  
Than all that othir compagnie.  
Their squyers undyd `[To undo a deer, is to cut it up.]` their deer,  
Eche man after his manere:  
Ippomedon a deer gede unto,  
That full konningly gon he it undo,  
So fair, that very son he gan to dight  
That both him byheld squyre and knighte;
The ladye looked out of her pavylyon,  
And saw hitn dight the venyson;  
There she had grete daintee,  
And so had alle that dyd hym see.  
She sawe all that he down threu,  
Of huntynge she wist he could enou,  
And thought in her heart then  
That he was come of gentilmen.  
She bad Jason her men to calle,  
Home then passed gret and smalle.  
Home thei come soon anon,  
This ladye to her meat gan gon, `[To her meat gan gon — went to dinner.]`  
And of venery `[Veuery — hunting.]` - had her fill,  
For they had taken game at will."

Thus this royal lady having ascertained that Sir Ippomedon was a good shot with a bow, that his greyhounds were of the right breed, and that he knew how to cut up his deer when he had brought it down, goes home to dinner satisfied that the stranger knight is a gentleman every inch of him.

Ipomedon  

Ipomedon is mentioned among the romances in the Prologue of Richard Cuer de Lyons which, in an ancient copy of the British museum, is called Syr Ipomydon: a name borrowed from the Theban war, and transferred here to a tale of the feudal times'. This piece is evidently derived from a French original. Our hero Ippomedon is fon of Ermones king of Apulia, and his mistress is the fair heiress of Calabria. About the year 1230, William Ferrabras', and his brethren, sons of Tancred the Norman, and well known in the romantic history of the Paladins, acquired the signories of Apulia and Calabria. But our English romance seems to be immediately translated from the French; for Ermones is called king of Poyk, or Apulia, which in French is Pouille. I have transcribed some of the most interesting passages'.

Ippomedon, although the son of a king, is introduced waiting in his father's hall, at a grand festival. This servitude was so far from being dishonourable, that it was always required as a preparatory step to knighthood ".  

Everie yere the kyng weld  
At Whytfuntyde a fest held  
Of dukis, erlis, and barouns,  
Mani ther com frome diverfe tounes,  
Ladyes, maydens, gentill and fre.  
Come thedyr frome ferre countre:  
And grette lordis of ferre lond,

"In the feudal castles, where many persons of both sexes were assembled, and who did not know how to spend the time, it is natural to suppose that different parties were formed, and different schemes of amusement invented. One of these, was to mount to the top of one of the highest towers in the castle.

» She was lady, by inheritance, of the signory. The female feudataries exercised all the duties and honours of their feudal jurisdiction in person. In Spencer, where we read of the *Lady of the Castle*, we are to understand such a character. See a story of a *Comtesse*, who entertains a knight in  
her castle with much gallantry. Mem. fur lanc. Chev. ii. 69. It is well known that  
anciently in England ladies were sheriffs of counties.

Ipomedon is a romance composed in Anglo-Norman verse by Hue de Rotelande in the late 12th century at Credenhill near Hereford. In the sequel Protheselaus, which must have been composed slightly later, Hue acknowledges as his patron Gilbert fitzBaderon, lord of Monmouth. Gilbert's death in or just before 1191 gives an approximate terminus ante quem to both romances.

[The life of Ipomydon]  
Of your court and your norture  
He hath well lerned, I you ensure;  
He wolde wende into a straunge count[re]  
More in seruyce for to be;  
So that ye take it not in greue,  
Full fayne he wolde praye you of leue,  
And I shall make me redy  
To wende with hym in company  
And serue hym as his owne knyght  
And honour hym with all my myght.'  
Than sayd Armones the kynge:  
"If this be his owne desyrynge  
I am well apayde of his wyll,  
For his askynge I holde skyll;  
And now I wote thou arte my frende  
Syth that thou wylte with hym wende;  
Take you ynough of all thynge  
And loke ye wante no spendynge!'  
Syr Tholomewe forth gan go  
And to Ipomydon came he tho,  
And sayd, "Syr, without lesynge,  
Your fader hath graunted your askynge;  
He badde ye sholde nothynge spare  
And myselfe shall with you fare.'  
"I praye God thanke you, mayster dere,
  
That ye me loue I may se here.'  
Than they busked them to go,  
Horse they toke and harneys also;  
Of all thynge they wanted none.  
Now to his fader the chylde is gone;  
On knees he fell before the kynge  
And prayed hym of his dere blessynge:  
"That blessynge haue thou, my sone treu,  
That Mary gaue vnto Iesu.'  
Now they go forth on theyr waye;  
Ipomydon to his men gan saye  
That there be none of them all  
So hardy, by his name hym to call,  
Whereso they wente ferre or nere,  
Or ouer the straunge ryuere:  
"Ne no man tell what I am,  
Where I shall go ne whens I cam.'  
All they graunted his commaundement  
And forth they go with one assent.  
Ipomydon and Tholomewe  
With robes and with mantelles newe  
Of the rychest that myght be;  
There was none suche in that countre,  
For there was many a ryche stone  
That on the mantelles fresshely shone.  
So longe the wayes they haue nome  
That to Calabre they be come.  
They came to the castell gate,  
The porter was redy therate;  
The porter to them they can call
  
And prayed hym go into the hall:  
"And tell thy lady gentyll and fre  
That comen are men of ferre countre,  
And yf it please her we wyll her praye  
That we myght dyne with her to-daye.'  
The porter sayd full courteysly:  
"Your erande to do I am redy.'  
The lady to her mete was set,  
The porter came and fayre her gret:  
"Madame,' he sayd, "God you saue.  
At your gates gestes ye haue.  
Straunge men as for to se;  
They aske mete for charyte.'  
The lady commaunded anone soone  
That the gates were vndone:  
"And brynge them all vnto me,  
For well at ease shall they be.'  
They toke theyr pages, horse and all.  
These two men went into the hall;  
Ipomydon on knees hym set  
And the lady fayre he grete:  
"I am a man of straunge countre  
And praye you, yf it your wyll be,  
That I myght dwell with you this yere,  
Of your nurture for to lere.  
I am come out of ferre lande,  
For I herde tell beforehande  
Of your nurture and your seruyse  
Is holden of so grete empryse.
  
I praye you that I may dwell here,  
Some of your seruyce for to lere.'  
The lady behelde Ipomydan  
And semed well a gentyll man;  
She knewe none suche in all her lande,  
So goodly a man and well farande;  
She sawe also by his nurture  
He was a man of grete valure.  
She cast full soone in her thought  
That for no seruyce came he nought,  
But it was worshyp her vnto,  
In her seruyce hym to do.  
She sayd, "Syr, welcome ye be,  
And all that cometh with the.  
Syth ye haue had so grete trauayle,  
Of a seruyce ye shall not fayle.  
In this countre ye may dwell here  
And at your wyll for to lere;  
Of the cup ye shall serue me,  
And all your men with you shall be;  
Ye maye dwell here at your wyll  
But your berynge be full yll.'  
"Madame,' he sayd, "graunt mercy!'  
He thanked the lady courteysly;  
She commaunded hym to mete,  
But, or he sate in ony sete  
He saluted them, grete and small,  
As a gentylman sholde in hall;  
All they sayd soone anone
  
They sawe neuer so goodly a persone,  
Ne so lyght ne so glad,  
Ne none that so ryche araye had.  
There was none that sate nor yede  
But they had meruayle of his dede,  
And sayd he was no lytell syre  
That myght shewe suche atyre.  
Whan they had eten and grace sayd  
And the table awaye was layd,  
Up than arose Ipomydone  
And to the buttry he wente anone  
And his mantell hym about;  
On hym loked all the rout  
And euery man sayd to other there:  
"Wyll ye se the proude squyere  
Shall serue my lady of the wyne  
In his mantell that is so fyne!'  
That they hym scorned wyst he nought,  
On other thynges he had his thought;  
He toke the cup of the butlere  
And drewe a lace of sylke full clere,  
Adowne than fell his mantell by.  
He prayed hym for his courteysy  
That lytell gyfte that he wolde nome,  
Tyll eftesoone a better come.  
Vp it toke the buttelere,  
Before the lady he dyde it bere,  
And prayed the lady hertly
  
To thanke hym for his courteysy.  
All that was than in the hall  
Grete honour they spake hym all,  
And sayd he was no lytell man  
That suche gyftes gyue can.  
There he dwelled many a daye  
And serued the lady well to paye;  
He bare hym on so fayre manere  
To knyghtes, ladyes and squyere,  
All hym loued that were hym by,  
For he bare hym so courteysly.  
The lady had a cosyn that hyght Iason,  
Full well he loued Ipomydon;  
Where that he went in or out,  
Iason wente with hym aboute.  
The lady laye but she slepte nought  
For on the squyere she had grete thought,  
How he was fayre and shaped wele,  
Body and armes euerydele;  
There was none in all her lande  
So well he semed doughty of hande;  
But she coude wete for no case,  
Fro whens he came ne what he wase,  
Ne of no man coude enquere  
Other than the straunge squyere.  
She her bethought on a queyntyse  
If she myght knowe in ony wyse,  
To wete wherof he were come;
  
This was her thought, all and some;  
She thought to wood her men to ta[n]e  
That she myght knowe hym by his name.  
On the morowe whan it was daye,  
To her men than dyde she saye:  
"Tomorowe whan it is daye-lyght,  
Loke ye be all redy dyght  
With your houndes more and lese,  
In the forest to take my grese,  
And there I wyll myselfe be,  
Your game to behelde and se.'  
Ipomydon had houndes thre  
That he brought from his countre;  
Than they were to the wood gone,  
This lady and her men euerychone,  
And with them theyr houndes lad,  
All that euer ony houndes had,  
Syr Tholomewe, forgate he nought,  
His maysters houndes thyder he brought  
That many a daye ne had ronne ere;  
Full well he thought to note them there.  
Whan they came to the launde on hyght,  
The quenes pauylyon there was pyght  
That she myght se of the best,  
All the game of the forest.  
The wandlessours wente thrugh the forest  
And to the lady brought many a beest,  
Harte and hynde, bucke and doo
  
And other beestes many mo.  
The houndes that were of grete pryce  
Plucked dere downe all at a tryce,  
Ipomydon with his houndes tho  
Drewe downe bothe bucke and doo;  
More he toke with houndes thre  
Than all that other company.  
Thre squyers vndyde theyr dere,  
Eche man on his owne manere;  
Ipomydon a dere wente vnto,  
Full cunnyngely he dyde it vndo,  
So fayre that veneson he it dyght  
That hym behelde bothe squyer and knyght;  
The lady loked out of her pauylyon  
And sawe hym dyght the veneson,  
There she had grete deynte,  
And so had all that dyde hym se.  
She sawe all that he downe drough,  
Of huntynge she wyst he coude ynough,  
And thought in her herte than  
That he was a gentyll man.  
She bad Iason her men to call;  
Home they passed, grete and small,  
Home they wente soone anone.  
This lady to her mete dyde gone  
And of venery had her fyll,  
For they had taken game at wyll.  
Ipomydon serued, as I vnderstande,  
As he was wonte to do beforehande.
  
"Syr,' she sayd, "without fayle,  
Ye haue ben in grete trauayle.  
Another man, as I you saye,  
Shall serue me at mete this daye;  
Go to your mete soone on hy,  
My cosyn Iason shall sytte you by.'  
The ladyes herte was on hym caste  
And she behelde hym wonder faste,  
Euer on hym she cast her eye,  
Ipomydon full well it sye.  
Anone it gaue hym in his thought,  
To loke agayne let wolde he nought,  
For no more cowarde thought he to be  
Of his lokynge than was she.  
The lady perceyued it full wele,  
Of all his lokynge euerydele,  
And therwith began to shame,  
For she myght lyghtly fall in blame;  
If men perceyued it onythyng,  
Bytwene them two of theyr lokynge,  
Than wolde they saye all bydene  
That some loue were them bytwene,  
Than sholde she in slaundre fall  
An[d] lese moche honoure therwithall.  
She thought to warne hym pryuely  
By her cosyn that sate her by.  
"Iason,' she sayd, "thou arte to blame,  
And therfore the ought to shame
  
To beholde my mayde in vayne.  
Euery man to other wyll sayne  
That bytwene you is some synne;  
Of thy lokynge I rede thou blynne.'  
Ipomydon hym bethought anon  
How that she blamed Iason  
Without deseruynge euerydele,  
But the encheson he perceyued wele;  
Downe he loked and thought grete shame  
That Iason bare for hym suche blame;  
Styll he sate and sayd ryght nought,  
To dwell no lenger there he thought.  
As the lady her chambre had tane,  
Before her came Ipomydane,  
And sayd, "Madame, God yelde it the,  
The grete honoure thou hast done me.  
Haue god daye, now wyll I fare  
Into the countre that I was yare.'  
"Felowe,' she sayde, "chose at thy wyll  
Whether thou wylte wende or abyde styll.'  
He wente anone into the hall  
And toke his leue of grete and small,  
Bothe of lesse and eke of more,  
As I sayd to you before.  
To Iason he wente anone-ryght  
And toke his leue with herte vnlyght;  
Than sayd Iason on hye:  
"Good syr, leue this folye  
And with my lady dwell here,
  
She loueth the in all manere.  
If thou wende forth in this wyll  
For sorowe she wyll herselfe spyll.'  
"Iason, felowe, let be thy thought.  
Lenger dwell here wyll I nought,  
For I shall wende home to my kynge  
And leue you here without ioyinge.'  
"Myne owne dere frende, syth it is so  
That thou wylte algates go,  
Gyue me leue with the to wende  
Into what countre that thou wylte lende,  
I wolde full fayne do it in dede.'  
"Graunt mercy, syr, God gyue the mede.  
With me hyther came ye nought.  
Ne shall with me but that I brought.'  
He toke his leue of Iason there  
And wente forth elleswhere.  
Whan the lady wyst that he was gone  
A sory woman than was she one;  
Vpon her bed she can her laye  
And to herselfe than gan she saye:  
"There is not suche a man in lande,  
If he be doughty of his hande,  
As he is of body to se,  
Of what lande that euer he be.'  
"Alas,' she sayd, "and wellawaye,  
That for a worde he wente awaye!  
Had men sought all mankynde  
A fayrer body myght no man fynde.'
  
This lady that was of ryche blode,  
That nyght she coude but lytell good,  
That she sholde suche mone make  
For a straunge mannes sake,  
That no man wyst what he was;  
But yet she sayd ofte, "Alas,  
For suche is none in Chrystente,  
Full well he semeth a knyght to be!'  
Thus she conforted herselfe amonge  
And ofte she felle in mournynge stronge.  
Ipomydon wente, as ye may here,  
Behynde he lefte a messengere  
For to brynge hym tydynges newe,  
If there were ony that he knewe;  
What they were he sholde them brynge,  
And that anone, without lettynge,  
The lande of Poyll he hath nome  
And to the kynge, his fader, is come  
And to the quene, his moder dere,  
For hym they made ryght glad chere.  
Courteyse he was, bothe stoute and bolde,  
And moche in lande of hym was tolde;  
All men hym loued, suche was his grace.  
Of chylde Ipomydon her is a space.  
They were togyder many a yere,  
With moche myrth and game in fere;  
The kyng his sone knyght gan make,  
And many other for his sake.  
Iustynges were cryed, ladyes to se,
  
Thyder came lordes grete plente,  
Tourneymentes atyred in the felde,  
A thousande armed with spere and shelde.  
Knyghtes began togyder to ryde,  
Some were on horsbacke on euery syde.  
Ipomydon that daye was vyctoryous  
And there he gaue many a cours.  
For there was none that he mette,  
And his spere on hym were sette,  
That after within a lytell stounde  
Hors and man bothe wente to grounde.  
The heraudes gaue the chylde the gree,  
A thousande pounde he had to fee.  
Mynstrelles had gyftes of golde,  
And forty dayes the feest dyde holde.  
Of the heyre of Calabre here wyll I tell,  
And of her baronage fayre and well,  
How that they had at counseyle bene  
And of assent was them bytwene  
That theyr lady sholde take an housbande  
To gouerne them and all theyr lande,  
Bycause she was of yonge age.  
To her came all her baronage  
And sayd, "Madame, we wyll you praye  
That we myght our wyll saye.  
Your lande thynketh ye do them wronge  
Without a kynge to be so longe,  
That myght gouerne this lande so fayre,  
And bytwene you haue an hayre,
  
And holde this lande in ryght blode.'  
The lady answered with mylde mode:  
"Your counsayle is good euerychone,  
But husbande yet wyll I haue none.'  
They toke theyr leue and wente theyr waye  
And betaught the lady good daye.  
To counseyle newe than gan they gone  
And full soone they were at one,  
To kynge Mellyager, her vncle, they went  
And tolde hym of the ladyes entent:  
For an husbande they had ben with her,  
And she gaue them a lyght answer.  
Forth they wente, without lettynge,  
To the lande there he was kynge.  
Kynge Mellyager soone they founde  
And anone they kneled to the grounde,  
Prayenge hym as lefe and dere  
That he wolde theyr prayer here;  
They tolde hym all-togyder now  
What they had done and how,  
And suche answere she gaue them tyll,  
Husbande to haue she had no wyll:  
"Wherfore, lorde, we wolde you praye,  
For we wete well that ye beest maye  
Counseyle well our lady now,  
As best may be the realmes prowe.'  
"Lordynges,' he sayd, "withouten fayle,  
I assent vnto your counseyle,  
For vnto my cosyn wyll I go
  
And make her, or I wende her fro,  
Me to graunte husbande to take,  
Or clene my loue she shall forsake.'  
Than they thanked the kynge so free  
And wente home to theyr countree.  
Kynge Mellyager to his cosyn is gone,  
And she hym welcomed fayre anone,  
And of his comynge she was glade,  
And full moche <ioye> of hym she made.  
Whan they had taken theyr sporte in hall,  
The kynge to counseyle gan her call  
And sayd, "Dere cosyn, here my wyll:  
A husbande must ye take you tyll,  
The whiche may of this lande be kynge,  
And gouerne it in all thynge;  
For no woman may take in hande,  
Well to gouerne suche a lande.'  
"Syr,' she sayd, "ye be of my blode,  
I holde your counseyle fayre and good  
And after it fayne wolde I do,  
As moost worshyp may be me to;  
But syth that I a husbande haue shall,  
Do make crye vnder this castell wall,  
Iustynges there thre dayes to lest,  
And who that there may bere hym best  
And that doughtyest is of hande  
Shall wedde me and all this lande.  
Syr, loke ye crye, without delaye,
  
Halfe a yere before the daye,  
That it may be knowen ferre and nere,  
On what daye it shall be here.'  
Now thynketh this fayre maye  
On the straunge squyer nyght and daye:  
"If he be suche as I hym holde,  
Also doughty and so bolde,  
For me than he wyll be here  
And wynne me in all manere.'  
Herawdes were called on hye,  
Thrugh the lande to make the crye;  
This crye was knowen ouerall,  
In all the lande of grete and small.  
Ipomydons messenger anone  
Home to Poyll gan he gone;  
The crye he vnderstode wele  
And tolde his mayster euerydele.  
Ipomydon in herte was full glad,  
Whan that he the tydynges had;  
He called his mayster Tholomewe,  
That euer was full good and trewe,  
And sayd, "Syr, make we vs redy,  
For into Calabre now wyll I!'  
He purueyed hym thre noble stedes  
And also thre noble wedes;  
That one was whyte as ony mylke,  
The trappour of hym was whyte sylke;  
That other was reed, bothe styffe and stoure,  
The trappoure was of the same coloure;
  
Blacke than was that other stede,  
Of the same coloure was his wede.  
Thre greyhoundes with hym he lad,  
The best that his fader had,  
Reed and whyte and blacke they were.  
Whan he was dyght in this manere,  
With hym he toke a fayre may,  
And wente forth on his iourney;  
Into Sesoney the waye they nome.  
Within the lande whan that he come,  
He badde Tholomewe take his stedes,  
All his men and all his wedes:  
"And take your ynne in the cyte  
By nyght that no man you se.  
Let no man se them by nyght ne daye,  
But them that shall theyr mete puruaye.'  
His owne way forth he nome  
Vnto a forest tyll that he come;  
There hunted kyng Mellyager in that forest,  
At harte and hynde and wylde beest;  
Ipomydon mette with a knyght  
And asked hym anone-ryght  
Who that grete lord was that was there,  
That in the forest chased the dere.  
The knyght sayd, "Yf ye wyll here,  
It is the kynge Mellyagere  
That thus hunteth here besyde.'  
Ipomydon vnto the kynge can ryde  
And saluted hym as a kyng dere,
  
He welcomed hym on fayre manere.  
He prayed the kynge yf it were his wyll,  
A lytell stounde to stande styll  
And here the speche of a knyght;  
The kynge hym graunted anone-ryght.  
"I am a knyght, as ye may se,  
And come I am from ferre countre,  
For noblesse of you I haue herde tell;  
All my desyre is with you to dwell,  
In your countre to be here,  
The maner of this lande to lere.'  
The kynge behelde the knyght than,  
He thought he was a goodly man:  
"In all his lande, bothe ferre and nere,  
Was none so fayre a bachelere.'  
"Syr knyght,' he sayde in fayre manere,  
"Gladly shall ye dwell here.'  
Ipomydon sayd, "I shall you tell,  
At this couenaunt wolde I dwell;  
Full fayne I wolde be redy bowne  
To lede your quene bothe vp and downe,  
From her chambre to her hall,  
And my lemman I wolde her call;  
My mayden that is of honoure  
Shall dwell in the quenes boure;  
At euery tyme that I her lede,  
A kysse of the quene shall be my mede.  
I wyll no more for my seruyse.'  
The kynge anone, without aduyse,
  
Thought he came for other thynge,  
And graunted hym his askynge.  
Anone the kynge lefte his game,  
Home they rode bothe insame  
And to the quene the couenauntes sayd.  
"As ye haue done, I holde me payd.'  
There he dwelled many a daye  
With moche myrth, game and playe;  
Full fayre he dyde his seruyce  
And serued the quene at her deuyse;  
Where that she wente, in boure or hall,  
The quene his lemman he dyde call.  
So it befell vpon a daye  
That to the iustynge men dyde them araye;  
Thyder wolde kynge Mellyager  
With all the knyghtes that with hym were:  
Syr Campany[u]s, that good knyght,  
In all the lande was none so wyght,  
And syr Caymus, the kynges stewarde,  
A doughty knyght and no cowarde.  
The kynge sayd to syr Ipomydon,  
That called was the quenes lemman,  
As he mette hym in the hall:  
"The tyme is come that iuste we shall;  
Dyght you now, go we our waye!  
I wote ye thynke to wynne the maye.'  
And he answered with mylde chere:  
"Who shall than serue my lady dere?
  
For certes of iustes can I nought,  
To serue my lady is all my thought.  
If I her lefte for other nede,  
I were not worthy to haue my mede.'  
The kyng tourned than awaye  
And to his knyghtes dyde he saye:  
"So fayre a body as bereth he,  
Alas, a cowarde that he sholde be!'  
Campany[u]s and all that stode by,  
They meaned that knyght courteysly;  
They toke theyr leue at the quene  
And wente forth all bydene,  
Vnto Calabre they toke the waye,  
There they sholde iuste that other daye.  
Leue we them at the iustynge  
And talke we of other thynge,  
Of Ipomydon and the lady shene  
That was at home with the quene.  
Whan tyme came they sholde to mete,  
Ipomydon brought her to her sete;  
Into the hall whan he her brought,  
To take his kysse he forgate nought.  
Whan she had eten, to chambre she is gone,  
Ipomydon vnto the quene wente anone:  
"Tomorowe, madame, I wolde you praye,  
With leue of you, whan it is daye,  
To go to the forest to take a dere.  
My greyhoundes ranne not this quartere;
  
Whyle that my lorde is at the iustynge,  
My greyhoundes I wolde fayne se rennynge.  
Of one thynge, madame, I wolde you praye:  
If I come not by tyme of daye,  
Whan ye se tyme, to mete ye wende,  
For I wote not howe longe I lende.'  
"Syr,' she sayd, "God you spede.'  
He kyssed her and forth he yede.  
Ipomydon called his mayster than,  
Syr Tholomewe, that noble man:  
"To my hostage ye go by nyght,  
My whyte stede, loke he be dyght,  
And with the armure hyther ye brynge  
Tomorowe, or the daye sprynge.  
Hye you out at the castell yate  
And from all syght kepe you algate.'  
Ipomydon wente to the portere  
And prayed hym, yf his wyll were,  
The gate myght be opened before daye;  
The porter graunted and toke hym the kaye,  
And at the fyrst cocke arose he;  
Forth he wente with houndes thre,  
In a leasshe he dyde them do  
And blewe a grete horne also;  
He blewe lowde and shoke it well,  
That it ronge all the castell.  
The maydens to the quene dyde saye:  
"Your lemman goth to wynne the may.'
  
The quene answered, without lettynge:  
"All men knowe not of iustynge.  
Thoughe he knowe not of suche dedes,  
He may be good at other nedes.'  
Ipomydon is to Tholomewe gone,  
He toke him his houndes euerychone.  
He prayed hym, as his mayster dere,  
To mete them well in all manere,  
And with the flesshe kepe them in place,  
There as theyr steuen set was.  
He sayde, "God spede the, lorde dere!  
Therto I shall do my deuere.'  
Ipomydon went forth and his page  
Tyll he came to an hermytage;  
He loked forth and behelde,  
Many a knyght he sawe in felde.  
Eche to other fast dyde ryde  
With grete speres on eche syde.  
He toke his spere anone-ryght  
And lepte vpon his stede so lyght;  
In he came amonge them all,  
Thrugh the cloudes as he had fall;  
The fyrst knyght he dyde to ryde  
With a spere, that wolde abyde,  
In the mydes of the shelde he set his spere,  
That horse and man he dyde downe bere.  
Another knyght he mette also,  
And there his backe he brast tho;  
The thyrde he slewe, without lettynge,
  
The fourth wente into the same rynge.  
There was no knyght that he mette  
That wolde his spere on hym sette,  
But yf his spere all tobrake,  
He wolde hym to the grounde shake.  
The lady laye ouer the castell wall  
And behelde the iustes all;  
She sent speres whyte and blacke  
To all men that wolde them take.  
Iason she sent vnto the knyght  
That in the whyte armes was dyght,  
To bere hym speres at his nede;  
She thought hym the worthyest of dede,  
And euery man to other dyde saye,  
He was the manlyest there that daye.  
Than all the people homewarde wente  
And Iason to the knyght hym bente,  
Prayenge hym, "As his lorde dere,  
Come home to thyne owne manere,  
For well I wote thou shalte be kynge,  
The whiche is gretly to my lykynge!'  
"Iason,' he sayd, "God the foryelde  
Thy grete seruyce to-day in the felde,  
That thou hast done me in this place.'  
Iason meruayled of that case:  
"Syr,' he sayd, "for charyte,  
What man be ye that knoweth me?'  
"It were merueyle but I the knewe.  
Somtyme thou were my felowe trewe.
  
I am,' he sayd, "the straunge squyer  
That serued my lady this other yere;  
Grete her well in fayre manere.  
This daye for her I haue ben here,  
But lenger dwell here may I nought,  
Suche tydynges to me is brought  
Home from myne owne countre,  
And forth I must, as I tell the.'  
"A, syr,' he sayd, "arte thou he?  
For God that dyed vpon a tre,  
Come now and with my lady speke,  
Or elles I wote her herte wyll breke,  
For and she knewe thou wente thy waye,  
She lyueth not tomorowe daye.'  
"Thou shalte, Iason, vnderstande  
I wolde not tary for all this lande.'  
He toke his leue and went his waye.  
Iason to the quene dyde saye  
Worde by worde euerydele:  
"The straunge squyer grette her wele.  
He was that ylke whyte knyght  
That in the felde so rychely was dyght.'  
This lady to her chambre is gone;  
A sorowfull woman is she one.  
Vpon her bedde she dyde downe fal  
In swowne before the maydens all,  
And whan she rose out of her swownynge,  
Her handes full fast than dyde she wrynge:  
"Alas,' she sayd, "what was I wood,
  
A wytles thynge, and coude no good!  
My wytte myght haue serued me  
That suche a man doughty must be.'  
But yet she trowed in her thought,  
So lyghtly wolde he leue her nought;  
That was her confort moost in care,  
And elles she had herselfe forfare.  
Ipomydon to his mayster came soone,  
And founde hym and his greyhoundes anone;  
Plente of flesshe had he caught,  
Hors and harneys to hym he raught,  
And eyther passed to theyr ynne.  
Ipomydon the flesshe toke with him,  
Before the quene he dyde it bere,  
As she was set at her soupere.  
"Madame,' he sayd, "my lorde, the kynge,  
Hath not thus sped with theyr iustynge.'  
All the hall that there were insame,  
At hym they loughe and had good game.  
Ipomydon wente to his mete,  
Fast he brake and softe he ete,  
For he had fasted all that daye;  
Suche a lykynge he had in playe.  
As they sate at theyr soupere,  
In cometh the kynges messengere;  
Vpon his kne he hym sette  
And full fayre the quene he grette.
  
To her sente worde her lorde, the kynge,  
How they had done at the iustynge;  
Than asked the quene anone-ryght:  
"Was there ony that with Campany[u]s dyde fyght,  
Whiche was so doughty in the felde,  
Eyther with spere or with shelde?'  
"Ye, madame, so may I the,  
There was one worth suche thre:  
In whyte armure he was dyght,  
In all the felde was none so wyght,  
But yf it were my lorde, the kynge,  
For he dyde passe in all thynge.'  
The quene asked, "what was he?'  
The messenger sayd, "So may I the,  
At that tyme knewe hym no man.'  
Than bespake Ipomydan  
And sayd, "messenger, I the praye,  
Vnto my lorde, the kynge, saye  
That my good whyte greyhounde  
Hath slayne more dere and brought to grounde  
Than wolde all his haue done to-daye.'  
Ipomydon to the messenger gan saye,  
Prayenge hym the kynge some bere,  
To wete that he was not to lere.  
The quene is to her chambre gone,  
Thyder ledeth her Ipomydone;  
He prayed for leue on the morowe to playe,
  
As he had done that other daye.  
The quene hym graunted courteysly;  
Vnto his mayster he dyde hym hye,  
And prayed hym soone anone  
To his hostage that he wolde gone  
And brynge hym his reed stede,  
Forgete nought the same wede,  
In the place that they were ere,  
And that he sholde be erly there.  
Full erly arose Ipomydan,  
His horne, his greyhounde he toke than.  
He blewe it lowde and well coude shake  
That all the maydens he dyde awake.  
Than sayd all that were therin:  
"Your lemman goth the lady to wynne.'  
The quene answered, as she dyde ere:  
"He may more wynne than he were there.'  
The kynges messenger forth went  
And toke hym hole his present;  
Euery worde to the kynge he tolde,  
Than sayde the knyghtes that were bolde:  
"Alas, that suche a knyght sholde lyue,  
But he to manhode wolde hym gyue!'  
Ipomydon to his mayster went,  
His armure and his stede he hent,  
The reed greyhounde he toke ryght.  
That daye he prayed hym to do his myght,  
And in that place kepe the flesshe  
With the greyhounde in the leshe.
  
Forth he wente in that stounde  
And to the hermytage he came sounde,  
Into the felde he loked than,  
He sawe there many an armed man,  
He hym armed and forth dyd ryde.  
Fast they iusted on euery syde,  
And euer behelde the lady bryght,  
If she myght se the whyte knyght;  
For she on hym no eye myght cast,  
But she thought her hert sholde brast.  
Iason that daye was made knyght  
And rychely in the felde was dyght;  
Ipomydon, this thynge he sawe  
That Iason was knyght, his owne felawe;  
To hym he prycked and fast gan hy;  
Whan he sholde mete, he rode hym by.  
That daye he thought hym so to done  
That worthely he wanne his shone.  
But Ipomydon, as I you saye,  
Many a knyght he felde that daye,  
So many speres he brake asondre  
That all the folke on hym had wondre.  
They sayd there was none in all that lande  
That was so manly of his hande,  
For all they sayd tho full tyte,  
The reed was better than the whyte,  
And so he bare hym that daye  
That knyghtes waxed wery of his playe.  
Whan that euery knyght gan in ryde,
  
Syr Iason dyde with hym abyde,  
And sayd, "Syr knyght, God the it yelde,  
Thy grete helpe to-daye in the felde!  
Thrugh the more loue that I wan,  
That more desyre I ne can.  
I wote thou shalt be lorde here  
For I knowe none that is thy pere,  
Saue yesterdaye the whyte knyght,  
But he is out of the lande dyght.'  
"Naye, Iason, my trewe fere,  
Thou shalte se that I am here.  
But grete well my lady dere,  
For her to-daye haue I ben here,  
The whiche I saye, without fayle,  
Wyll tourne to grete trauayle,  
And many an hors ryde to dede,  
Or I come there that I must nede;  
For all my lande I lese for aye,  
But I be there by a certayne daye.'  
Iason sayd, "Graunt mercy,  
And thynke vpon my lady,  
For and ye passe her thus fro,  
For sorowe she wyll herselfe slo!'  
Ipomydon sayd, "By heuen-kynge,  
At this tyme I wyll not lynge,  
But greet her well and haue good daye,  
And I shall come whan that I maye.'  
Syr Iason passed forth therby  
And this tale tolde to the lady:
  
"The reed knyght and the whyte is one,  
But for-sothe now is he gone!'  
Than sory was that swete thynge,  
And ofte she fell in grete mournynge  
But she bethought her, as she dyde yare,  
And elles she had herselfe forfare.  
Ipomydon to his mayster yede,  
And toke him his armure and his stede;  
He toke the flesshe and the greyhounde,  
And towarde the towne he hym bounde;  
His hors he had and his huntynge-wede,  
Anone into the hall he yede,  
Before the que[ne] the flesshe he layd,  
"Here is my dayes iourney,' he sayd.  
At hym they lough and made glad chere,  
The quene went to her soupere  
And her lemman sate her by.  
The kynges messenger came full ny,  
And sayd the kynge grette her wele;  
The iustynge he tolde her euerydele.  
The fyrst worde the quene can saye:  
"Came the whyte knyght there to-daye?'  
"Naye,' he sayd, "By God almyght,  
But there was a noble reed knyght,  
The whiche all men that had hym se,  
Sayd that he was better than he.'  
Ipomydon sayd to the messengere:  
"Recommende me to my lorde so dere,
  
And saye that Gager, my reed greyhounde,  
Moche dere hath brought to grounde.  
I had more ioye at his rennynge  
Than to stande and stare at the iustynge.  
"Madame,' he sayd, "so God me mende,  
Of your game I rede ye hym sende.'  
"Syr,' she sayd, "as ye thynke beest.  
Farewell for now I go to rest.'  
Vnto her chambre she wente than;  
Before her wente Ipomydan,  
Ones of leue he wolde her praye,  
He wolde not hunte after many a daye.  
She graunted hym his boone,  
Vnto his mayster he wente full soone;  
He yede and set, without lacke,  
Stede and harneys that was blacke;  
He knewe the way at the forest,  
Where they sholde mete in the best.  
The messenger came vnto the kynge,  
His present fayre he dyde hym brynge;  
What he sholde saye forgate he nought.  
The kynge of hym wonder thought  
And in his herte had grete pyte,  
So goodly a man as was he,  
That euer he was so lytell of pryse  
And therto full of cowardyse.  
Whateuer they thought in theyr herte,  
Many of them he made to smerte.  
Let hym go, God hym spede,
  
Tyll eftesoone we of hym reed.  
Ipomydon arose erly there,  
As he was wonte to done ere;  
Forth he rode blowynge his horne,  
That all the maydens dyde hym scorne  
And sayd, "Your lemman goth to playe,  
For he wyll wynne vp all to-daye.'  
The quene them blamed wonder fast,  
Her herte to hym was somwhat cast.  
Vnto his mayster he wente by and by  
And prayed hym full hertely  
To take more dere, yf he myght,  
Than he dyde that other daye-lyght.  
Anone his horse he dyde dyght,  
And rode to the felde forth-ryght,  
Armure blacke lyke the stede,  
To the hermytage forth he yede;  
Anone his stede he bestrode,  
Amonge them all in he rode.  
He was ware of a knyght  
In reed atyre that was dyght --  
"This reed knyght was here yesterdaye,  
He iusted for that fayre maye.  
There was none bare hym so fayre,  
Of Calabre he wyll wynne the hayre.'  
The lady laye on the toure on hye,  
Full soone the reed knyght dyde she spye;  
She thought it had be the straunge squyer  
That she hoped sholde be her fere.
  
Her purpose was to hym to wende,  
Whan the iustynge came to ende,  
And brynge hym with fayre manere,  
To her was none so lefe ne dere.  
Ryght as the quene in that thought stode,  
The reed knyght anone in rode;  
The blacke knyght toke a spere in hande,  
For to iuste with hym he thought in lande,  
And eyther with other soone they mette,  
In-mydde the shelde the stroke they sette.  
The blacke knyghtes spere was full stronge,  
And therwith he dyde fast thronge  
The knyght and stede within a stounde,  
That they lay bothe vpon the grounde.  
Ipomydon toke the reed stede,  
And to his men he dyde hym lede.  
Than came forth syr Caymus,  
A proude knyght and a daynous;  
Iuste he wolde with the blacke knyght,  
But all to lytell was his myght;  
With a spere that well wolde laste,  
Knyght and horse downe he caste.  
Syr Caymus horse he toke lyghtly,  
The reed knyght set hym by.  
Syr Campany[u]s full fast hym helde,  
He thought to iuste with hym in felde;  
His thought was to wynne that maye,  
But he fayled foule of his praye.
  
Forth they rode togyder fast  
That theyr speres asondre brast;  
Bothe they were styffe and stronge,  
Fast dyde they ryde, they taryed not longe,  
And eyther of them toke a spere;  
Campany[u]s thought hym downe to bere.  
In-mydde the place the knyghtes mette,  
Ipomydon so Campany[u]s grette,  
That knyght and stede in that case  
Fell on a hepe in-mydde the place.  
The blacke knyght toke his stede good,  
The kynge therat waxed wood  
That he his knyghtes downe dyde bere.  
He folowed the knyght with a spere;  
He had thought to do hym harme,  
For he smote hym thrugh the arme.  
Ipomydon with that stroke abrayd  
And to the kynge thus he sayd:  
"As thou arte kynge, gentyll and fre,  
Abyde and iuste a course with me,  
And I forgyue the this vyllany!'  
The kynge sayd, "Therto graunte I!'  
Full fayne he wolde haue ben awaye,  
But for shame he sayd not naye.  
The kynge and he, in place they mette,  
The blacke knyght suche a stroke hym sette,  
That kynge and horse downe he cast,
  
That he thought his necke tobrast.  
The kynges stede he lede away,  
Than euery man to other dyd say:  
"He may well be kynge of the lande,  
For he is the doughtyest man of hande,  
That ony man sawe euer here.'  
And so sayd all that were there,  
They gaue hym the gree of the felde  
For the doughtyest man vnder shelde.  
Herawdes dyscryued his armes blake  
And sayd, in the worlde was not his make,  
And they sayd, without lettynge,  
He was worthy to be kynge.  
Whan euery man home dyde drawe,  
Iason wente vnto his felawe:  
"Come home, syr, I you praye,  
Vnto your owne, I dare well saye.  
Ye shall be made kynge of the lande  
For the doughtyest man of hande.  
Thou hast no pere, I dare well saye,  
So sayd all that were here to-daye.'  
"Iason,' he sayd, "God yelde it the,  
The grete honour thou gyuest me.'  
Iason sayd, "Yf your wyll it be,  
What are ye that knoweth me?'  
"Sometyme I was thy felowe dere  
That called was the straunge squyere;  
I haue ben here these dayes thre,  
But now no lenger I may be.'
  
"For Godes loue,' sayd Iason, "or ye hens fare,  
Come brynge my lady out of care  
And confort her in all thynge,  
And thynke also ye shall be kynge.'  
He sayd, "Iason, thy worde thou spare,  
For that wolde tourne me to moche care;  
I haue dwelled here to longe,  
The whiche wyll cause me trauayle stronge.  
Recommende me to her anone-ryght,  
For I must trauayle daye and nyght.'  
He toke his leue and forth dyde fare;  
Iason tourned home full of care,  
And whan he came into the hall,  
He tolde the lady what was befall,  
The blacke knyght was the squyer stronge,  
That had dwelled with her so longe,  
And howe he wanne her with his hande:  
"But he is passed out of the lande.'  
The lady mourned and was full wo,  
She thought her herte wolde brast in two,  
But yet she trowed in her thought  
So lyghtly wolde he leue her nought,  
Syth that he had, without fayle,  
For her loue so grete trauayle.  
Ipomydon forth is gone  
With his stedes euerychone;  
He founde his mayster with stuffe ynoughe  
Houynge vnder the grete wood-boughe;  
He toke hym the stedes euerychone
  
And to his ynne he badde hym gone.  
He toke his houndes and his horne  
And layde the flesshe hym beforne;  
Before the quene he it layd,  
And in his game thus he sayd:  
"Knowe ye ony at the iustynge,  
That hath wonne halfe so moche thynge?'  
The quene, as she was wonte to doone,  
To her souper she went soone,  
And her lemman, without dout;  
Scantly had they mete set out,  
Whan in cometh the kynges messangere  
And grette well the lady in this manere:  
"Well you gretteth my lorde, the kynge.  
He byddeth you for onythynge  
That ye be tomorowe erly  
At the chalenge of that lady.'  
The quene than dyde saye:  
"Hath the reed knyght wonne her to-daye?'  
"I saye, madame, so God me spede,  
The reed knyght hath lost his stede,  
My lorde, the kynge, hath lost his also,  
Campany[u]s, Caymus and other mo;  
The blacke knyght hath wonne them all,  
Moche honoure vnto hym is fall.'  
Than bespake Ipomydone:  
"Better it is on huntynge to gone  
In the forest, so God me spede,
  
Than thus lyghtly to lese a stede.  
Wherfore, messenger, I the praye  
In my behalfe that thou saye,  
Whan thou comest to the kynge,  
Greet hym well in all thynge,  
And saye my blacke greyhounde, Gylmyne,  
To-daye hath borne hym well and fyne,  
For he hath taken many a beest,  
The gretest that was in the forest,  
And therfore, madame, yf your wyll it be,  
Syth we haue so grete plente,  
Sende hym some, whyle we may.  
He wyll vs quyte another day.'  
Ipomydon was sore trauayled  
In the games that he had sped;  
His arme vnstopped, the blode dyde fall  
Vpon the table before them all;  
Than sayd the quene, "My lemman dere,  
How are ye hurte in this manere?'  
"For-sothe, madame, I shall you saye:  
I lette renne at a dere to-daye,  
My palfrey I prycked after so fast  
That he stumbled and me downe cast.  
At that tyme I toke this harme,  
A stumpe smote me thrugh the arme,  
And that was for, I sholde saye,  
The gree of the felde I toke to-daye.'  
So they laughed at hym that nyght  
That some myght not syt vpryght.
  
The quene sayd, "My lemman hende,  
Tomorowe wyll we togyder wende  
And se who hath wonne the maye.'  
Ipomydon answered and sayd, "Naye,  
Syth I was not at the iustynge,  
I wyll not be at the chalengynge;  
But of one thynge, madame, I you praye.  
Delyuer my mayden to me this daye,  
For suche tydynges is come to me  
That I must home to my countre;  
And I shall be, bothe daye and nyght,  
Whyle that <I> lyue, your owne knyght.'  
The quene sayd, "Dwell here styll!'  
For to let hym go she had no wyll.  
He toke his leue at his lady  
And at the maydens that stode her by;  
His owne mayden that was so bryght,  
To his hostage she wente ryght,  
There she neuer came before,  
Syth his stedes were harborowed thore.  
He set hym downe in the hall,  
His hoste to hym he let call.  
Into the stable he hym ledes,  
There as stode his good stedes,  
And sayd to hym, "My frende dere,  
I wolde the praye on this manere  
That my worde thou vnderstonde  
And this message thou take in honde:
  
Thou hast herde speke of the iustynge  
That hath ben for the lady, that fayre thynge,  
And also of the whyte knyght,  
The fyrst daye that iusted ryght;  
I was that knyght that standeth the by,  
And on this whyte stede rode I.  
Of the reed knyght thou herde saye,  
That iusted on that other daye;  
That same knyght for-sothe I was,  
This reed stede I had in place.  
Vpon the thyrde daye thou harde tell  
Of a blacke knyght how it befell;  
On his blacke stede that daye I sate  
And all these other on hym I gate;  
Therfore, good syr, I the praye  
That thou do, as I the saye:  
Aryse vp in the mornynge  
And go to the maydens challengynge!  
Take this same whyte stede  
And a man dyght in the same wede,  
Vnto my lorde, the kynge, thou wende  
And greet hym well as lorde hende,  
Saye, the quenes lemman, his owne knyght,  
Sende hym this stede and armure bryght;  
The fyrst daye he rode theron thore,  
He knoweth well how he hym bore;  
And saye that well vouchesafe I wolde,  
Thoughe euery heere were syluer and golde.  
Take the reed stede with the armure clere
  
And greet well my lady dere;  
And saye her lemman and her knyght  
Sende her this stede and armure bryght!  
Take the armure and the blacke stede,  
To syr Campany[u]s thou hym lede!  
Take here the kynges owne stede,  
To the heyre of Calabre thou hym lede!'  
And all-togyder he dyde hym saye  
How he sholde present the fayre maye:  
"Campany[u]s stede thou take anone  
And lede hym vnto syr Iasone.  
This other reed stede, without drede,  
I to the gyue for thy mede,  
On hym before thou shalte ryde  
And all these other by thy syde.'  
He taught hym, or he wente awaye,  
In what wyse that he sholde saye,  
And for the herbygage of his stedes  
He gaue hym twenty pounde to medes.  
The burgeys helde vp his honde  
And thanked God of his sonde:  
"Of Calabre I wote who shall be kynge,  
Now am I glad of my herborynge.  
I shall make your present  
Ryght gladly with good entent.'  
The burgeys toke the stedes than,  
On euery stede he set a man,
  
On the thre that the knyghtes were,  
Men armed in all theyr gere.  
Forth they wente, without lesynge,  
Towarde the maydens chalengynge.  
Soone they came to the cyte  
There lordes were grete plente.  
Soone the lordes dyde them sy  
There as they sate in company.  
They had wonder of the stedes  
And of the men in dyuers wedes;  
The kynge knewe the burgeys at all,  
Anone to hym he let hym call:  
"Whose be these stedes that be so stronge?  
Myne I knowe well them amonge.'  
"Syr, with your leue styll syt,  
And the trouth ye shall wytte.  
The quenes lemman, syr, ywys,  
Gretteth you well with ioye and blys  
And sendeth the this whyte stede,  
And with hym the same wede,  
That he rode on the fyrst daye.  
Hym to take he wolde you praye,  
Vouche hym safe on you he wolde,  
And euery heere were syluer and golde;  
He prayed God kepe you hole and sounde,  
For the best lorde that euer he founde.'  
Vnto the quene than sayd he there:  
"Well you greteth your lemman dere.  
This reed stede that is so swyfte,
  
He prayeth you to take hym of his gyfte.  
On you he voucheth safe, by saynt Martyne,  
Though euery heere were of syluer and gold fyne,  
For his lady good and trewe  
And the curteysest that euer he knewe.'  
To syr Campany[u]s forth he wente:  
"The quenes lemman, syr, you sente  
This blacke stede with the atyre, I saye,  
That he rode on the last daye;  
He prayeth you ye wolde hym take,  
For a doughty knyght, by Goddes sake.'  
Vnto the mayde he wente there  
And grette her on this manere:  
"The straunge squyer hath you sent  
This ylke stede to present;  
He stale hym not he badde me saye,  
He wanne hym on the lyght-daye,  
And yf ye byleue hym not, as ye myght deme,  
He badde you aske the kynge, your eme,  
And holde vp that you haue hyght,  
To take no man but he were lyght.'  
The kynge sayd, "I felte full wele  
How he bare hym euerydele;  
Of his dedes I am full sore,  
Suche a stroke I bare neuer afore.  
I dare well saye, by Goddes myght,  
That he is a doughty knyght,  
Without boost, stalworth of hande.
  
A queynter knyght is none in lande.'  
Syr Campany[u]s spake wordes than  
And sayd, "He is a doughty man,  
To iuste he lette as he were fered,  
But foule he hath our eyen blered.'  
The burgeys to Iason sayd thus:  
"This stede ought syr Campanius.  
He sente hym the for his fere,  
To loke well to his lady dere.'  
Vnto syr Caymus dyde he saye:  
"He greteth the well by me to-daye.  
He wolde haue sente you stedes moo,  
But he had none he myght forgoo.  
This reed stede he gaue to me,  
His messenger for to be,  
And for the herbygage of his stedes  
He gaue me twenty pounde to medes.'  
All they sayd there they stode,  
He was come of gentyll blode.  
Than sayd the heyre of Calabre bryght:  
"Helpe me to gete that gentyll knyght!  
But I hym haue that in felde me wan,  
For-sothe I wyll neuer haue man.'  
Anone dyde syr Caymus saye:  
"Is he stolen thus awaye  
And broke my ladyes boure, the quene,  
And ledde awaye her mayden shene?  
Worthe I neuer glad ne fayne,
  
But I brynge them bothe agayne.'  
The kynge was courteys and gent,  
Full goodly he receyued his present;  
Hertly he thanked the gentyll knyght  
And sayd in lande was none so lyght.  
He gaue the burgeys for his message  
An hondred pounde to herytage.  
But Ipomydon forth is gone  
And his men euerychone.  
His messenger he lefte styll there,  
To brynge hym tydynges, yf ony were,  
In suche maner as they fell;  
What they were he sholde hym tell.  
Ipomydon came by a forest,  
A whyle he thought there to rest,  
He was forwaked and all wery;  
To his men he sayd on hy:  
"Slepe I must, without fayle,  
For I am wery of my trauayle.'  
He layde his heed on his maydens arme  
And fell on slepe and thought no harme.  
He had not sleped but a whyle,  
Not the mountnaunce of a myle,  
The mayden sawe forth comynge  
An armed knyght fast rydynge;  
She woke her lorde and badde hym ryse,  
For her herte began to gryse.  
Than came forth Caymus full stoute,  
To hym he spake wordes proute:
  
"Traytoure, he sayd, "thou dydest dyshonoure,  
Whan thou brakest the quenes boure  
And toke her mayden and my stede.  
Agayne to courte I wyll the lede.  
Aryse, thou traytoure, I bydde the,  
To courte thou shalte agayne with me!'  
Ipomydon hym answered now:  
"To courte I dare as well as thou,  
But for the tourne I nyll,  
Not but at myne owne wyll.  
For His loue that vs dere bought,  
Syth I haue hast, let me nought!'  
Caymus than to hym dyde sayne:  
"Wylte thou nylt thou, thou shalte agayne,  
Or ryght here thou shalte abyde!'  
Ipomydon sterte hym vp that tyde,  
Anone he mounted vpon his stede,  
They rode togyder with good spede.  
Ipomydon vnhorsed Caymus tho,  
That his arme brast in two.  
He badde his men take his stede  
And let a worse hors hym lede.  
In his sadle they set hym backewarde  
And bounde hym with a corde full harde,  
To the tayle was tourned his vysage,  
They badde hym lerne a newe vsage.  
Thus Caymus rode vnto the towne,  
Whan he had lost all his renowne.
  
His horse hyed hym homewarde to fare,  
The mayster also with moche care.  
His horse to the courte hym brought.  
The kynge euer on Caymus thought  
And sayd he wolde not go to bedde,  
Tyll he wyst how the knyght spedde.  
The horse brought Caymus to the gate,  
The porter lete hym in therat.  
Iason the hors in dyde brynge  
And ledde the knyght before the kynge.  
The kynge asked, by Goddes payne,  
If he had brought the knyght agayne.  
Anone he answered vnto the kynge  
And tolde hym of his myslykynge:  
"Though all the knyghtes in the hall  
Came to hym, bothe grete and small,  
He wolde of them gyue nothynge,  
But yf it were of you, syr kynge.'  
Than they laughed all insame,  
And at his harme had good game.  
There was none in that place,  
But they were glad of that cace.  
Thus Caymus hath his seruice quytte,  
And of Ipomydon here is a fytte.  
Ipomydon helde forth his waye,  
Full glad he was of his iourney.  
He sawe grete folke agaynst hym ryde,  
The whiche had sought hym wonder wyde,  
For to brynge hym newe tydynge
  
That deed was his fader, the kynge,  
Of whiche tydynge he was woo,  
But he may not agaynst God doo.  
Thrugh his lande he wente rydynge;  
All the people honoured hym as kynge,  
And whan he came into that stede,  
That the kynge, his fader, was dede,  
Thrughout that lande he lete crye  
That all men sholde thyder hye,  
Preestes and clerkes of euery towne,  
Bysshoppes, erles and barowne.  
There he made an entyerment  
With many masses with good entent.  
An archbysshop buryed his fader dere,  
Prechynge there was many a frere.  
Poore men that sate vpon the grounde,  
Well deled of many a pounde.  
A grete feest there was dyght  
For erles and for many a knyght;  
All men that therof wolde take  
Had mete there for Goddes sake.  
Whan this feest was broken vp,  
Euery man his leue toke  
And wente theyr waye, as I you tell;  
Ipomydon thought at home to dwell.  
His moder and he dwelled insame  
With moche myrth, ioye and game,  
Tyll it befell vpon a daye,  
The quene to her sone dyde saye
  
In preuyte and in counsayle:  
"Thou hast a broder, without fayle,  
Goten on me pryuely,  
Or I was wedded to ony,  
But hastely he was done fro me;  
I wote not yf he alyue be,  
But he sente this other yere  
A ryche rynge of golde full clere.  
And euer he ony broder had,  
I sholde gyue it hym he bad,  
That where he came amonge hye or lowe,  
By that rynge he sholde hym knowe.  
Than take this rynge, my sone, of me.  
In what countre that ye be,  
Who that knoweth this ylke rynge,  
He is thy broder, without lesynge!'  
The rynge he toke of his moder  
And trusted well to knowe his broder.  
Thus they departed in that place,  
And after went in shorte space  
Vnto hym came his baronage,  
Whiche were men of grete parage;  
Theyr entent is to crowne hym kynge,  
But his thought was on other thynge,  
For crowne wolde he none bere.  
He wolde be more assayed there  
In other landes, ferre and nere,  
Of his strength and his powere.  
He had an vncle was styffe and stronge,
  
Of mydle age to lyue longe.  
Syr Perse of Poyl was his name,  
Men he dystroyed that dyde shame.  
Before his baronage, I vnderstande,  
Ipomydon seased hym in his lande  
And gaue hym the profyte for his sake,  
Tyll that he the crowne wolde take.  
Now tourne we all the matere  
And speke we of Calabre the heyre.  
A duke dwelled Calabre besyde,  
A stoute man and of grete pryde.  
He was myghty and of grete powere,  
Men dredde hym bothe ferre and nere.  
His name was duke Gerone,  
Of Seyssene-lande he was barone.  
This doughty duke herde saye  
The heyre of Calabre was suche a maye,  
Messengers he sente anone  
Vnto Calabre for to gone.  
He sayd he wolde haue her to wyfe,  
If she wolde, without stryfe,  
"And in case she wolde not so,  
I shall make her moche wo;  
For I shall destroye her landes all,  
Her men slee, bothe grete and small,  
Her castell breke and her boure,  
With strength take her in her toure,  
Oneles that she may fynde a knyght  
That for her lande with me dare fyght.'
  
Forth than wente the messenger  
And tolde the lady this mater;  
The lady answered ryght-soone  
And sayd she wolde neuer haue none,  
"But hym that me wan, so God me saue,  
Other husbande wyll I none haue.'  
This messenger his erande dyde sayne  
And homewarde he wente agayne.  
He tolde the duke of her answarre,  
Anone he began grete warre,  
For grete power gadred he  
To wynne this mayden that was so fre.  
Ipomydon his messenger had herde  
Of this tydynge how it ferde;  
Vnto his mayster he wente soone  
And tolde hym bothe all and some.  
Whan he had herde, Ipomydan,  
Than was he a sory man,  
That he ne myght with that duke fyght,  
Whiche was holden so noble a knyght.  
Ryght vnsemely on queynt manere  
He hym dyght, as ye shall here.  
A barbour he called, withouten more,  
And shaued hym bothe behynde and before,  
Queyntly endented out and in,  
And also he shaued halfe his chyn.  
He semed a fole, that queynt syre,  
Bothe by heed and by atyre.  
Armure he toke that was rusty,
  
And horsed hym on an olde runcy;  
A helme as blacke as any pan,  
A croked spere he toke hym than.  
Whan tha[t] he was thus dyght,  
He semed yll a doughty knyght.  
Vnto Sesseyne he wente, as ye may here,  
Vnto the kynge Mellyagere,  
And in the hall he brake his spere,  
Ryght as he wood were,  
The tronchon fell vpon the borde;  
He fared as he had ben wode.  
The kynge and quene laughed lyght  
And sayed he was a fole well dyght.  
"Fole, go to mete!' the kynge dyde saye;  
The fole answered and sayd, "Naye!  
For yet I wyll not ete with the,  
But they a bone wyll graunt me:  
The fyrst dede of armes I wyll haue,  
That ony person of the wyll craue.'  
"Fole, go to mete!' sayd the kynge,  
"I graunte the thyne askynge.'  
The fole wente to mete lyghtly  
And tyed his horse fast hym by,  
But or he rose from the borde  
Many men laughed at his worde.  
Into the hall came rydynge a maye,  
Out of Calabre, the sothe to saye,  
On a whyte mule before the kynge,
  
A dwarfe with her came rydynge.  
"Syr kynge, my lady greteth well the,  
And prayeth the, for charyte,  
To helpe her in this myster  
Agaynst the dukes power;  
He hath destroyed her landes all,  
Ryght vnto her castell wall,  
And without she haue helpe of the,  
She wyll leue her landes and fle.'  
The kynge answered anone  
And sayd, "All my knyghtes are gone,  
Campany[u]s and other full bolde.  
Helpe my cosyn fayne I wolde,  
But they be all at a dede,  
To helpe a lady o[u]t of drede.  
In this worlde knowe I no knyght  
That durst alone with hym fyght.'  
Vp sterte the fole anone,  
Vnto the kynge he sayd full soone:  
"Lo, I am here all redy dyght,  
That dare with hym alone fyght.'  
"Sytte downe, fole!' the mayde dyde saye,  
"We lyste not to speke of playe.  
Dryue thy foly where thou wyll,  
For no ioye haue I there-vntyll!'  
The fole sayd, "Be thou wroth or glad,
  
Suche promesse of the kynge I had  
That I sholde haue the fyrst dede.'  
The mayden tourned and forth yede.  
The fole sterte vp, without delaye,  
And sayd, "Syr kynge, haue good daye!'  
He stepte on his horse there  
And sayd, "Farewell and haue good yere!'  
Some sayd he was a fole well dyght,  
And some sayd he semed a knyght  
That is come fro ferre countre,  
Bycause he wolde not knowen be.  
He prycked his horse wonder fast,  
The mayde he sawe at the last.  
As they rode by the waye,  
The mayde to the dwarfe dyde saye:  
"Vndo my tente and set it fest,  
For here I wyll a whyle me rest!'  
Mete and drynke bothe they had,  
That was fro home with them lad.  
Bothe they dranke therof and ete,  
But euer the fole without sete,  
Not one morsell they wolde hym cast,  
Though he sholde for hunger brast.  
The dwarfe sayd, "We be to blame.  
Gyue the fole some mete for shame!'  
"Not one morsell!' she dyde saye,  
"For hunger shall dryue hym awaye.'  
With that there came rydynge a knyght  
Vnto her tente anone-ryght.
  
"Come forth with me!' to her he sayd,  
"I haue the spyed syth thou out brayd.  
Thou arte my lemman as I haue thought.'  
The fole sayd, "That byleue I nought.  
She is myne, I wyll her haue,  
From the I hope her wele to saue!'  
The knyght sayd, "Fole, leue thy foly,  
Or elles thou shalte dere aby!'  
The fole sterte to a tronchon  
That bare vp the maydens pauylyon,  
And smote the knyght on the crowne  
That starke-dede he felle downe.  
He gaue the dwarfe the knyghtes gere,  
To hymselfe he toke the spere,  
Vp they rose and forth yede,  
Tyll efte to rest they had nede.  
They toke mete and made them glad,  
To the mayde the dwarfe bad:  
"Gyue the fole some mete for shame,  
He hath saued you from blame,  
And thynke ye sholde haue ben shent,  
Had he ben out from you present!'  
The mayde answered hym anone:  
"By God, mete geteth he none.  
It was but foly, I prayse it nought,  
I wolde he were from vs brought.'  
With that there came another knyght,  
The mayde he chalenged anone-ryght  
And sayd, "Come forth, my lady dere!'
  
The fole sayd, "Thou hast none here.  
She is myne and longe hath bene.'  
With that the knyght began to tene  
And sayd, "Fole, thou shalte aby,  
If thou speke more of this foly!'  
The fole sayd, "I wyll not blynne.  
If thou her haue, thou shall her wynne!'  
With that he lepte on his horse lyght,  
And eyther to other dyde them dyght;  
The fole hym meteth with a spere  
That thrugh the body he dothe hym bere.  
The knyght was dede thrugh this dede,  
Vnto the dwarfe he gaue his stede.  
Forth they busked them anone  
Vnto a place they thought to gone,  
There they wolde haue ben all nyght;  
They myght no ferther [f]or lacke of lyght.  
They toke them mete and drynke good-spede,  
Vnnethes they wolde the fole ony bede.  
Ryght as they sate and made them glad,  
There came a knyght, as the deuyll bad;  
He was the dukes broder Geron,  
All was blacke that he had on,  
Bothe his horse and his wede.  
Vnto the mayde he dyde hym spede  
And sayd, "Syth I fynde you here,  
Ye shall be my lemman dere!'  
The fole sayd, "Nay, not so.
  
Another she hath taken her to:  
That am I thou seest here.  
Yf thou her bye, she is to dere.'  
"Fole,' he sayd, "thou bourdest grete.  
With my spere I shall the bete!  
Her tyme foule had she spedde,  
Yf she sholde lye with the in bedde.'  
The fole sayd, "Twyse I her bought.  
With thy chydynge thou getest her nought.  
If thou her haue, thou shalte her by  
A peny derer than euer dyde I.'  
There was no lenger to abyde,  
But eyther of them to other dyde ryde;  
The fole mette the knyght so  
That he his backe brast in two.  
With that stroke he hym slewe  
And his armure of he drewe.  
Anone he toke the knyghtes stede  
And armed hym in his wede.  
Whan the fole was well dyght,  
The mayde hym semed a godly knyght,  
And trowed well fole was he none,  
By the dedes that he had done.  
They layde them downe to take theyr rest.  
The dwarfe full soone slepte fest,  
But the mayde wakynge laye  
And on the fole thynkynge aye;  
She demed he was a doughty knyght,  
Wherfore to hym she dyde her dyght.
  
"Syr knyght,' she sayd, "slepe you now?  
Ye are no fole that well I know.  
Ye be a doughty knyght of hande,  
I knowe none suche in all this lande,  
And the same knyght, so trowe I,  
That somtyme wanne my lady,  
I trowe full well thou be he.  
Wylte thou leue her and wedde me?  
Thou shalte be of grete powere:  
I am as ryche as is the heyre  
Of Calabre-lande, without doute.'  
The knyght loked fast aboute  
And euermore styll he laye  
And herde her speke, as I you saye,  
And whan that she had all sayd,  
He sterte hym vp in a brayd,  
And therwith vp he arose,  
And wolde haue taken her by the nose.  
Euer the fayrer that she spake,  
The fouler braydes dyde he make.  
Thus he wrangled and went awaye,  
One worde to her he wolde not saye.  
Whan she se it wolde not be,  
"Syr knyght,' she sayd, "for charyte,  
Trowes[t] thou thou shalte not fayle  
To helpe my lady in this batayle  
And with the duke Gerone to fyght,
  
As thou kynge Mellyager hyght?  
What shall I to my lady saye,  
Whyther wyll ye come or naye?'  
"Tomorowe whan I the duke se,  
Perauenture in suche plyght I may be  
That I wyll the batayle take,  
And so it may falle I wyll it forsake,  
For I am holden nothynge you tyll,  
Nought but at myne owne wyll.'  
The mayden tourned homewarde and thought,  
To his answere she wolde saye nought.  
She bad the knyght haue good daye,  
And he sayd, "Farewell, fayre maye,  
In at a preuy posterne gate  
By nyght she stale in therat,  
And to the lady she tolde soone  
What the fole had for her doone,  
And that he cometh for her to fyght.  
This lady was a sorowfull wyght,  
For on the morowe the duke with pryde  
Vnto the castell gate he dyde ryde,  
But they were shette hym agayne.  
With a loude voyce than dyde he sayne:  
"Come out, lemman, on fayre manere.  
I wyll no lenger tary here,  
Or elles a knyght ye out sende,  
With me to fyght you to defende!'  
And as they stode thus talkynge,
  
He sawe a knyght come rydynge;  
A glad man than was he,  
His broder he had wende it had be.  
It was not he, as ye shall here,  
He answered the duke in this manere:  
"What arte thou that makest this cry,  
And at this gate so grete maystry?'  
"I am,' he sayde, "lorde of her within,  
For I am syker this mayde to wyn,  
And wyll so done or I hens gone,  
So that other husbande geteth she none.'  
Ipomydon sayd, "That thou shalte mys,  
For all myne owne that lady is,  
And full longe she hath ben so,  
And therfore I rede the hens go.  
I wyll her defende from all men!'  
The duke answered anone then:  
"Traytour,' he sayd, "thou arte another.  
I wende thou haddest ben my brother.  
His stede thou hast, his armure, lo,  
I trowe thou hast hym slayne also!'  
"That I hym slewe I gaynesaye nought.  
So to serue the I haue thought.'  
With that worde, without lye,  
Fast togyder than dyde they hye,  
So that theyr speres all tobrast;  
Forth they drewe theyr swerdes and fought fast.  
The lady laye in a hye toure
  
And sawe betwene them all the stoure,  
But she ne wyst whiche for her dyde fyght,  
For they in lyke wede were dyght.  
Greter batayle myght none be,  
For neyther wolde for other fle;  
They fought togyder wonder longe,  
The batayle was bothe styffe and stronge,  
That of theyr lyues neyther rought.  
Ipomydon than hym bethought  
He was in poynt to lese there,  
That he had bought wonder dere;  
His swerde in bothe handes he toke,  
It was sharpe, as sayth the boke,  
And hertly he dyde it vplyfte,  
Amydes the crowne he gaue hym swyfte,  
Thrugh helme and basenet it raught,  
His crowne was shauen at one draught.  
The duke felte hym hurte full sore,  
He prayed the knyght to smyte no more:  
"I am nye deed, I may not stande,  
I yelde me here vnto thy hande  
And shall be thyne owne knyght,  
At thy wyll bothe daye and nyght.  
I shall restore into this lande  
More good than euer I fande,  
And euermore whyle I lyue,  
A thousande pounde I wyll the gyue.'  
Ipomydon sayd, "I graunt the here,  
So that thou do on this manere,
  
Thou come not nye this pauylyowne,  
But hye the fast [out of] the towne!'  
The duke hym graunted hastely,  
Out of the towne for to hye.  
He and all that with hym were come,  
Homewarde they hyed them full soone.  
Ipomydon rode to the pauylyon,  
Lyke as it were duke Geron.  
Besyde the castell where was the hayre,  
Renneth a ryuer longe and fayre,  
With shyppes and sayles manyfolde;  
Theyr stremers were of fyne golde.  
The lady sayd she wolde flee,  
If the duke wanne the gree.  
These shyppes stuffed with vytayle,  
Whiche with this lady sholde sayle.  
She loked out into the towne  
And sawe one come to the pauylyowne.  
She wende the duke had wonne the gree,  
Wherfore she busked her to flee.  
Ipomydon to the gates wente,  
Than the lady helde herselfe shente.  
"Come forth,' he sayd, my lemman dere,  
For I haue wonne the now here!'  
The lady herde hym make suche crye,  
To her shyp than dyde she hye;  
They plucked vp sayles and forth dyde passe,  
She and her men, bothe more and lasse.
  
Tourne we now anone-ryghtes  
To speke of kyng Melliagers kny#3tes,  
That whan theyr iourney was done  
They them busked home full soone,  
Campanius and his felowes full bolde.  
Whan the tydynges to them was tolde  
Of the heyre of Calabre, that fayre maye,  
And of the duke, as I you saye,  
And how she sent after socoure,  
The preuyest mayde in her boure,  
And how a fole hath take in hande,  
To fyght with hym in that lande.  
Syr Campanius busked hym forth to fare,  
To brynge the lady out of care,  
And all the power that had the kynge  
Busked them to that fyghtynge  
In all the hast that they myght,  
With the duke for to fyght.  
Towarde Calabre as they rode,  
They sawe shyppes in the flode;  
Anone they called to them there  
And asked them of whens they were.  
The shypmen sayd, "Of Calabre-lande.  
A duke hathe wonne it with his hande.  
Here is the lady, as ye maye se,  
She hath forsaken her owne countre.'  
Campanius prayed the lady to dwell,  
And somwhat of her grefe to tell.
  
She herde it was her vncles knyght  
And tourned agayne anone-ryght  
And tolde the knyghtes all lyghtly  
Of the duke that was so doughty,  
And how the fole had hym borne  
Of good poyntes therebeforne,  
And how the duke hath hym slayne,  
"And comen is to my gates agayne.'  
Campanius sayd anone-ryght:  
"I dare laye it was the same knyght  
Was comen out of his lande,  
For he was doughty [o]f his hande.  
Madame, I rede we tourne agayne,  
And we shall se who is slayne,  
And than we shall this dede wreke,  
If we haue grace with hym to speke,  
That all this lande shall therof here,  
And elles hange me by the swere,  
But I his heed vnto you brynge!'  
All they graunted, without lesynge.  
This lady tourned her shyp anone  
And with syr Campanius forth is gone.  
Whan she came the castell nye,  
As ferre as she myght it espye,  
In that place she wolde not abyde,  
Tyll she wyste how it wolde tyde.  
Campani[u]s all his men let call,
  
And to the castell they went all;  
They sawe a knyght in blacke atyre,  
They wende full well the duke it were  
That had destroyed the lande aboute.  
Vnto hym they hyed all the route.  
Campanyus sayd in this manere:  
"What arte thou that standeth here?  
Tell me why thou makest this dyn,  
And what thou woldest haue herein.'  
He sayd, "My lemman that I wan,  
I wyll not leue her for no man!'  
Syr Campanius sayd, "Thou getest her nought!  
I rede from her thou chaunge thy thought,  
And go home to thy countre,  
Or elles, for-sothe, thou shalte deed be.  
Wherfore fast hens thou hy,  
Without ony more vyllany,  
And elles I swere, by God almyght,  
We shall all agaynst the fyght.'  
Ipomydon sayd, "What may this be?  
Is this the maner of this countre?  
If ony of you haue better ryght  
Than I haue to this lady bryght,  
Come forth and proue it with your hande,  
One for one, whyle I may stande!'  
Campanius answered to the knyght:  
"Chose whether thou wylte go or elles fyght!'
  
Ipomydon sayd, "Syth it is so  
That I shall her thus forgo,  
Rather I wyll the batayle take  
And lese my lyfe for her sake,  
And put it all in Goddes hande!'  
Agaynst them all he thought to stande;  
All at ones on hym they layde,  
Ipomydon his swerde outbrayd,  
And many a man he felled downe ryght.  
He fought with many a doughty knyght,  
That many a stroke vpon hym layd.  
"Yelde the, traytour!' "Not yet!' he sayd.  
The knyghtes that were of grete pryde,  
Fast they fought on eche syde.  
Ipomydon sawe none other wone,  
But socoured hym at a wall of stone,  
And they pursued after fast  
That many vnto deth he cast.  
So longe agaynst them he dyde stande,  
They hewed the gloues of his hande;  
All bare-handed fought this knyght,  
They sawe neuer none so wyght.  
Syr Campanius, as I vnderstande,  
Sawe the rynge on his hande,  
That he gaue his moder, the quene;  
Many a yere he had it not sene.  
Campanius prayed hym stande styll,  
Whyle he asked hym a skyll.
  
The knyght answered and bad hym saye,  
For all they were wery of that playe.  
"Syr knyght,' he sayd, "tell me this thynge!  
Where had ye that ylke rynge?'  
Ipomydon answered as he thought,  
And sayd, "For-sothe, I stale it nought.  
For thou coueytest to haue the rynge,  
I swere by Iesu, heuen-kynge,  
Or thou it haue with mystery,  
With sore strokes thou shalte it by!'  
Syr Campanius prayed hym with fayre chere  
To tell hym on fayre manere,  
Where he had that ylke rynge,  
And saye the sothe, without les[ynge.]  
Ipomydon sa[yd, ' . . . . line damaged]  
I wyll tell [ . . . . line damaged]  
But tell me why thou doost enquere,  
And I shall gyue the an answere.'  
"This rynge,' he sayd, "that is so fyne,  
For-sothe, sometyme it was myne.  
Now, as ye are a gentylman,  
Tell me where ye that rynge wan.'  
"The quene,' he sayd, "of Poyll-lande  
Gaue me this rynge, as ye may vnderstande.  
She is my moder good and fayre,  
Of all that lande I am the hayre.'  
"Syr knyght,' he sayd, "yet abyde.
  
What sayd she more to you that tyde?'  
"She sayd, I hade a broder on lyfe,  
Was goten or that she was wyfe,  
And sayd, who that knoweth this rynge  
Was my broder, without lesynge.'  
Syr Campanius sayd, "by God almyght,  
I am thy broder, thou gentyll knyght.'  
They fell bothe downe in that stounde,  
At ones fallynge on the grounde.  
Men caught them vp and waked them bothe,  
They were full glad and nothynge lothe.  
Ipomydon enquyred of his brother,  
What was his name, for none knewe other.  
He sayde, "Syr Campanius I hyght,  
That agaynste the dyde fyght.  
With kynge Mellyager dwelled I.'  
"Somtyme we were in company.  
Knewe [ye] neuer the quenes lemman,  
[line damaged . . . ]e this mayde wan?'  
..... [line missing] .....

Ipomydon sayd, "I bare the shelde,  
That wanne the lady in the felde.  
Stedes I had that daye in place,  
The sothe ye knowe that it so was,  
Whyte and reed and blacke also;
  
Well ye wote that it was so.  
And there I wanne by Goddes grace  
The best stedes that daye in place,  
The kynges stede and thyne also,  
And of myne owne I sent you two,  
And yours I sent to other men;  
Ye wote well it was so then.  
I toke my leue of the quene,  
With me wente my mayden shene  
Homewarde myne owne lande.  
Syr Caymus sayd, I vnderstande,  
That he wolde seche vs bothe agayne,  
Or elles that he wolde be slayne.  
He sayd, I wente without leue,  
All ye wyst how it dyde preue,  
And therfore, broder, as I haue sayd,  
I am best worthy to haue the mayde.'  
They sawe it was the same knyght,  
Than all theyr hertes began to lyght.  
Euer as they wente, they dyde hym kysse,  
There was ioye and moche blysse.  
Messengers before dyde thrynge,  
To brynge the lady good tydynge.  
Whan she sawe they came so faste,  
Than the lady was agaste.  
She went they had dysconforted be,  
This lady badde drawe sayle and fle.  
The messengers cryed as they were wode,
  
Whan they sawe her go with the flode.  
They sayd, "Madame, drede ye nought.  
The straunge squyer hath you sought.'  
Whan she herde of hym speke,  
She thought her herte wolde tobreke,  
But she myght se hym with syght,  
That her wanne in grete fyght.  
They tourned the shyppes to the lande,  
Togyder they mette at the sande.  
Whan the lady of hym had a syght,  
She commaunded a bote anone-ryght,  
For at the lande fayne wolde she be,  
That she myght the knyght se.  
She lepte out of the bote lyghtly,  
Into the water the knyght stode by,  
And he in after also fast,  
That vp he gate her at the last.  
Whan they came vnto the lande,  
Ipomydon toke her by the hande  
And tolde her there, withouten fayle,  
Her loue had caused hym grete trauayle:  
"Syth fyrst that I dyde with you dwell,  
Halfe my sorowe I can not tell,  
And how ye blamed your cosyn Iason  
For that I loked you vpon,  
And than I toke my leue and went,  
Tyll I herde of your entent,  
Tyll that ye wolde haue a knyght  
That of his hande was moost wyght.
  
Thyder I drewe whan I it herde,  
All ye wote how that it ferde.  
I serued your vncle longe withall,  
The quenes lemman they dyde me call;  
And after I iusted dayes thre,  
Many men there dyde I se,  
And there I wanne stedes good,  
Some were reed as any blode,  
And also wysshely God me mende,  
The kynges stede to you I sende;  
But soone after, I vnderstande,  
I wente into myne owne lande,  
Tyll I herde vpon a daye  
Of the duke that made entraye;  
I busked me in queynt manere,  
Ryght as I a fole were,  
And wente agayne to the kynge.  
He knewe me not for nothynge;  
And thyder came fro you a mayde,  
And to the kynge these wordes she sayde,  
That he must you socoure sende,  
Fro the duke you to defende.  
But the kynge you of helpe forsoke  
And I the baytayle to me toke;  
Forth with the mayde dyde I gone  
And there I kepte her from her fone.  
Thre knyghtes of theyr lyues I let,  
And now the duke I haue dyscomfet.  
I dare well saye, by Goddes sande,
  
I haue you wonne with my hande.'  
Whan the lady herde how it was,  
She fell in swownynge in the place.  
He toke her vp with good spede,  
His mouth to hers he dyde bede,  
They kyssed togyder with good chere,  
For eyther was to other dere.  
I let you wytte, without delaye,  
Halfe theyr ioye I can not saye.  
Forth they wente to the castell  
There the lady before dyde dwell.  
All that nyght they were insame  
With moche myrth, ioye and game.  
On the morowe the clerkes were bowne,  
To wryte letters of grete renowne  
Vnto the kynge of Sesseney-lande,  
That was her vncle, I vnderstande;  
Vnto the Emperour, I dare well saye,  
Were wrytten letters of grete noblaye,  
To archbysshops and bysshops of the lande,  
Preestes and clerkes that were at hande,  
Dukes, erles and barons also;  
Knyghtes and squyers sholde thyder go.  
Messengers were sent euerywhere,  
For poore and ryche, all sholde be there.  
And whan the lordes these tydynges herde,
  
They hyed them fast thyderwerde.  
This feest was cryed longe before,  
Forty dayes withouten more.  
Metes were made grete plente,  
For many a man there sholde be.  
With the Enperour came to the feest  
An hondred knyghtes at the leest,  
And with the kynge, her vncle, also,  
To hondred horses without mo.  
Syr Perse of Poyll thyder came  
And with hym knyghtes of grete fame,  
That doughty were of that lande,  
In batayle proued, I vnderstande.  
On the morowe whan it was daye,  
They busked them, as I you saye,  
Towarde the chyrche with game and gle,  
For to make that grete solemnyte.  
The archebysshoppe of that lande  
Wedded them, I vnderstande.  
Whan it was done,as I you saye,  
Home they wente, without delaye.  
By that they came to the castell,  
Theyr mete was redy euerydell.  
Trompettes to mete dyde blowe tho,  
Claryons and other mynstrelles mo.  
Tho they wysshe and wente to mete,  
And euery lorde toke his sete.  
Whan they were set, all the route,  
Mynstrelles blewe than all aboute,
  
Tyll they were serued all with pryde  
Of the fyrst course at that tyde.  
The seruyce was of grete aray,  
That they were serued with that daye.  
Thus they ete and made them glad,  
With suche seruyce as they had.  
Whan they had dyned, as I you saye,  
Lordes and ladyes wente to playe,  
Some to tables and some to chesse,  
With other games, more and lesse.  
Ipomydon gaue in that stounde  
To mynstrelles fyue hondred pounde,  
And other gyftes of grete noblaye  
He gaue to other men that daye.  
Thus the feest, as it was tolde,  
Forty dayes it was holde.  
Ipomydon his broder let call,  
There he stode in the hall,  
And gaue hym all Poyll-lande,  
But an erledome, I vnderstande,  
And of that lande made hym kynge,  
And after hym his ofsprynge.  
He thanked God and hym with mode,  
And euery man spake of hym gode.  
Syr Campanius forth is gone on sande  
Vnto the kynge of Sesseneys lande,  
He was in his chambre there,  
Talkynge with the ladyes in fere.  
He tolde of the gyftes fayre,
  
Of Poyll-lande how he was hayre.  
The ladyes answered all in one:  
"Suche a man in the worlde is none!'  
Ipomydon, there he stode in hall,  
Tholomewe he let to hym call  
And gaue hym an erledome fre,  
And a mayde, his wyfe to be,  
That was with hym in Poyll-lande,  
With the quene, I vnderstande,  
Syr Tholomewe tho dyde saye:  
"I thanke you, lorde, for this maye  
And for your gyftes many one,  
That ye haue gyuen me here-beforne.'  
Tho passed he forth, as I you saye,  
There he lyked best to playe.  
Ipomydon, in hall there he stode,  
Bethought hym of mylde mode  
Of his felowe, syr Iasan,  
How he was a worthy man.  
To hym he gaue bothe ferre and nere  
Grete lande, as ye may here,  
To his wyfe a fayre maye,  
That he had loued many a daye,  
And other gyftes he gaue also  
Vnto other men many mo.  
Whan this feest was come to ende,  
Euery man home wolde wende.  
On the morowe, without lesynge,  
The Emperour went vnto the kynge,
  
His leue to take gan he gone,  
And with hym lordes many one.  
At the takynge of his leue  
Halfe the ioye I can not dyscryue,  
That there was them amonge,  
Of ladyes and of knyghtes stronge.  
The Emperour hath his leue tane  
At the kynge, Ipomydane,  
And at the quene fayre and fre,  
So dyde many mo than he.  
Thus the lordes fayre and hende,  
Homewarde all they dyde wende,  
Euery lorde to his countre,  
Or where they lyked best to be,  
And lefte them there bothe insame,  
With moche myrth, ioye and game,  
There to dwell for euermore,  
Tyll them departed deth sore.  
Ipomydon and his lady dere  
Lyued togyder many a yere,  
With all ioye that men myght se.  
In the worlde so moche none myght be,  
As was euer them amonge,  
Tyll deth them departed that was stronge.  
And whan they dyed, I trowe, ywys,  
Bothe they wente to heuen-blys,  
There as none other thynge may be,  
But ioye and blys, game and gle.  
Vnto that blys God brynge vs all,
  
That dyed on a crosse for grete and small.
