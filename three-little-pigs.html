<h1>The Three Little Pigs<a class="headerlink" href="#the-three-little-pigs" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h1>
<p>From the archived <a class="reference external" href="https://shanklinhistory.net/S&amp;amp;DHS%20Dec%202020%20Update.pdf">December 2020</a> newsletter of the <a class="reference external" href="https://shanklinhistory.net/newsletters.html">Shanklin &amp; District History Society</a>, I learn that an early version of the <em>Three Little Pigs</em> that first appeared in the <a class="reference external" href="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=alsCAAAAQAAJ&amp;amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;amp;dq=Popular+Rhymes+and+Nursery+Tales+1853&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;newbks=1&amp;amp;newbks_redir=0&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;redir_esc=y#v=snippet&amp;amp;q=SHANKLIN&amp;amp;f=false">1853 edition</a> of J. O. Halliwell’s <em>Popular Rhymes and Nursery Tales</em>  was collected on the Island, and set in Shanklin.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Henry Smith and Three Little Pigs</p>
<p>Nursery rhymes were passed down orally through the generations, with many variations in the detail, until people began to collect and publish them. The earliest printed version of one tale was Pigweeney the Wise: or The History of a Wolf &amp; Three Pigs in 1830. It involved a fairy and a house of iron rather than brick. A variation from Dartmoor, published in 1853, involved a fox stalking a group of pixies. It is thanks to Henry Smith that we have the authentic Shanklin version of the story. It includes a reference to the family farm and the additional feature of an apple tree which does not appear in other versions. Henry’s version was sent, with other tales then current in the Isle of Wight, to James Orchard Halliwell, a friend of his brother Charles, who included it in the 1853 5th edition of his <em>Nursery Rhymes and Nursery Tales of England</em>.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>According to a <a class="reference external" href="https://isleofwightfolkarchive.co.uk/Christmas%20Bumper%20Box.pdf">note</a> on “Dave and Anwyl’s <em>Isle of Wight Folk Archive</em>” website:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>The Three Little Pigs is amongst many stories and tales that were collected by Henry Smith. It is thought that his aunt Amelia from Arreton, who used to entertain people with stories, may have told this one. It refers to the Shanklin Fair which would have probably have been the Hiring / MopFair just after Michaelmas. The fair would have been at the beginning of October which also relates to there being apples on the ground. It also talks of the Mr Smith’s Home Field and Merry Garden at Languard.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>The claim that the tale was submitted to Halliwell some time earlier is attested to by an acknowledgement in the preface to the 1849 edition, dated April, 1849, <a class="reference external" href="https://archive.org/details/popularrhymesan00hallgoog/page/n14/mode/2up">p. ix-x</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>The compiler’s best thanks are due to Captain Henry Smith for the very interesting communication of rhymes current in the Isle of Wight ; …</p>
</div></blockquote>
<div class="seealso dropdown admonition">
<p class="admonition-title">Smith’s other submissions to Halliwell</p>
<p>Smith is also cited in the 1849 edition in respect of the submission relating to Shrove Tuesday customs, <a class="reference external" href="https://archive.org/details/popularrhymesan00hallgoog/page/n266/mode/2up">pp. 246-9</a>.</p>
<p>That edition also includes references to Isle of Wight folklore regarding wood pigeons, <a class="reference external" href="https://archive.org/details/popularrhymesan00hallgoog/page/n190/mode/2up">pp.172-3</a>; dragonfiles, <a class="reference external" href="https://archive.org/details/popularrhymesan00hallgoog/page/n190/mode/2up">pp. 174-5</a>; and a New Year wassail, <a class="reference external" href="https://archive.org/details/popularrhymesan00hallgoog/page/n256/mode/2up">p. 236</a>.</p>

<p>LV. The Three Little Pigs</p>
<p>ONCE upon a time there was an old sow with three little pigs, and as she had not enough to keep them, she sent them out to seek their fortune. The first that went off met a man with a bundle of straw, and said to him, “ Please, man, give me that straw to build me a house ; “ which the man did, and the little pig built a house with it. Presently came along a wolf, and knocked at the door, and said,</p>
<p>“ Little pig, little pig, let me come in.” To which the pig answered, “ No, no, by the hair of my chiny chin chin.”</p>
<p>The wolf then answered to that, “Then I’ll huff, and I’ll puff, and I’ll blow your house in.”</p>
<p>So he huffed, and he puffed, and he blew his house in, and eat up the little pig.</p>
<p>The second little pig met a man with a bundle of furze, and said, “ Please, man. give me that furze to build a house ; “ which the man did, and the pig built his house. Then along came the wolf, and said,—</p>
<p>“ Little pig, little pig, let me come in.”</p>
<p>“ No, no, by the hair of my chiny chin chin.”</p>
<p>“Then I’ll puff, and I’ll huff, and I’ll blow your house in.”</p>
<p>So he huffed, and he puffed, and he puffed, and he huffed, and at last he blew the house down, and he eat up the little pig.</p>
<p>The third little pig met a man with a load of bricks, and said, “ Please, man, give me those bricks to build a house with ;” so the man gave him the bricks, and he built his house with them. So the wolf came, as he did to the other little pigs, and said,” Little pig, little pig, let me come in.” “ No, no, by the hair of my chiny chin chin.”</p>
<p>Then I’ll huff, and I’ll puff, and I’ll blow your house in.”</p>
<p>Well, he huffed, and he puffed, and he huffed, and he puffed, and he puffed, and he huffed; but he could not get the house down. When he found that he could not, with all his huffing and puffing, blow the house down, he said, “ Little pig, I know where there is a nice field of turnips.” “Where?’ said the little pig. “ Oh, in Mr. Smith’s Home-field, and if you will be ready to-morrow morning I will call for you, and we will go together, and get some for dinner.” “ Very well,” said the little pig, “ I will be ready. What time do you mean to go? “ “ Oh, at six o’clock.” Well, the little pig got up at five, and got the turnips before the wolf came (which he did about six) and who said, “ Little pig, are you ready? “ The little pig said, “Ready! I have been, and come back again, and got a nice pot-full for dinner.” The wolf felt very angry at this, but thought that he would be up to the little pig somehow or other, so he said, “ Little pig, I know where there is a nice apple-tree.” “ Where? “ said the pig. “ Down at Merry-garden,” replied the wolf, “ and if you will not deceive me I will come for you, at five o’clock to-morrow, and we will go together and get some apples.” Well, the little pig bustled up the next morning at four o’clock, and went off for the apples, hoping to get back before the wolf came ; but he had further to go, and had to climb the tree, so that just as he was coming down from it, he saw the wolf coming, which, as you may suppose, frightened him very much. When he wolf came up he said, “ Little pig, what ! are you here before me ? Are they nice apples?” “Yes, very,” said the little pig. “ I will throw you clown one ; “ and he threw it so far, that, while the wolf was gone to pick it up, the little pig jumped down and ran home. The next day the wolf came again, and said to the little pig, “ Little pig, thers is a fair at Shanklin this afternoon, will you go?” “Oh yes,” said the pig, “ I will go ; what time shall you be ready?” “At three,” said the wolf. So the little pig went off before the time as usual, and got to the fair, and bought a butter-churn, which he was going home with, when he saw the wolf coming. Then he could not tell what to do. So he got into the churn to hide, and by so doing turned it round, and it rolled down the hill with the pig in it, which frightened the wolf so much, that he ran home without going to the fair. He went to the little pig’s house, and told him how frightened he had been by a great round thing which came down the hill past him. Then the little pig said, “ Hah, I frightened you then. I had been to the fair and bought a butterchurn, and when I saw you. I got into it, and rolled down the hill.” Then the wolf was very angry indeed, and declared he <em>would</em> eat up the little pig, and that he would get down the chimney after him. When the little pig saw what he was about, he hung on the pot full of water, and made up a blazing fire, and, just as the wolf was coming down, took off the cover, and in fell the wolf; so the little pig put on the cover again in an instant, boiled him up, and eat him for supper, and lived happy ever afterwards.</p>

<p>XIV. The Story of the Three Little Pigs</p>
<p>Once upon a time when pigs spoke rhyme
And monkeys chewed tobacco,
And hens took snuff to make them tough,
And ducks went quack, quack, quack, O !</p>
<p>THERE was an old sow with three little pig and as she had not enough to keep them, sh sent them out to seek their fortune. The fin that went off met a man with a bundle of straw, and sat to him :</p>
<p>“ Please, man, give me that straw to build me house.”</p>
<p>Which the man did, and the little pig built a house</p>
<p>with it Presently came along a wolf, and knocked at the door, and said :</p>
<p>“Little pig, little pig, let me come in.”</p>
<p>To which the pig answered :</p>
<p>“ No, no, by the hair of my chiny chin chin.”</p>
<p>The wolf then answered to that :</p>
<p>“Then I’ll huff, and I’ll puff, and I’ll blow your house in.”</p>
<p>So he huffed, and he puffed, and he blew his house in, and ate up the little pig..</p>
<p>The second little, pig met a man with a bundle of furze, and said :</p>
<p>“ Please, man, give me that furze to build a house.”</p>
<p>Which the man did, and the pig built his house. Then along came the wolf, and said :</p>
<p>“ Little pig, little pig, let me come in.”</p>
<p>“ No, no, by the hair of my chiny chin chin.”</p>
<p>“Then I’ll puff, and I’ll huff, and I’ll blow your house in.”</p>
<p>So he huffed, and he puffed, and he puffed, and he huffed, and at last he blew the house down, and he ate up the little pig.</p>
<p>The third little pig met a man with a load of bricks, and said :</p>
<p>“ Please, man, give me those bricks to build a house with.”</p>
<p>So the man gave him the bricks, and he built his house with them. So the wolf came, as he did to the other little pigs, and said :</p>
<p>“ Little pig, little pig, let me come in.”</p>
<p>“ No, no, by the hair of my chiny chin chin.”</p>
<p>“Then I’ll huff, and I’ll puff, and til I blow your house in.”</p>
<p>Well, he huffed, and he puffed, and he huffed and puffed, and he puffed and huffed ; but he could get the house down. When he found that he could i with all his huffing and puffing, blow the house down, said :</p>
<p>“Little pig, I know where there is a nice field turnips.”</p>
<p>“ Where ? “ said the little pig.</p>
<p>“ Oh, in Mr. Smith’s Home-field, and if you will ready to-morrow morning I will call for you, and we will go together, and get some for dinner.”</p>
<p>“ Very well,” said the little pig, “ I will be ready. What time do you mean to go ? “</p>
<p>“ Oh, at six o’clock.”</p>
<p>Well, the little pig got up at five, and got the turnips before the wolf came (which he did about six) and who said :</p>
<p>“ Little Pig, are you ready ? “</p>
<p>The little pig said : “ Ready ! I have been and come back again, and got a nice potful for dinner.”</p>
<p>The wolf felt very angry at this, but thought that I would be up to the little pig somehow or other, so he said :</p>
<p>“ Little pig, I know where there is a nice apple-tree.”</p>
<p>“ Where ? “ said the pig.</p>
<p>“ Down at Merry-garden,” replied the wolf, “ and if you will not deceive me I will come for you, at five o’clock to-morrow and get some apples.”</p>
<p>Well, the little pig bustled up the next morning at four o’clock, and went off for the apples, hoping to get back before the wolf came ; but he had further to go, and had to climb the tree, so that just as he was coming down from it, he saw the wolf coming, which, as you may suppose, frightened him very much.

<p>And he threw it so far, that, while the wolf was gone to pick it up, the little pig jumped down and ran home. The next day the wolf came again, and said to the little pig:</p>
<p>“ Little pig, there is a fair at Shanklin this afternoon, will you go ? “</p>
<p>“ Oh yes,” said the pig, “ I will go ; what time shall you be ready ? “</p>
<p>“At three,” said the wolf. So the little pig went off before the time as usual, and got to the fair, and bought a butter-churn, which he was going home with, when he saw the wolf coming.

He went to the little pig’s house, and told him how frightened he had been by a great round thing which came down the hill past him. Then the little pig said :</p>
<p>“ Hah, I frightened you, then. I had been to the fair and bought a butter-churn, and when I saw you, I got into it, and roiled down the hill.”</p>
<p>Then the wolf was very angry indeed, and declared <em>would</em> eat up the little pig, and that he would get down the chimney after him. When the little pig saw what was about, he hung on the pot full of water, and made a blazing fire, and, just as the wolf was coming down took off the cover, and in fell the wolf ; so the little pig put on the cover again in an instant, boiled him up, and ate him for supper, and lived happy ever afterwards.</p>

<p><em>Remarks</em>, — As littie pigs do not have hair on their chinny chinchins, I suspect that they were originally kids, who have. This would bring the tale close to the Grimms’ “ Wolf and Seven Little Kids,” (No. 5). In Steel and Temple’s “ Lambikin “ (<em>Wide-awake Stories</em>, p. 71), the Lambikin gets inside a Drumikin, and so nearly escapes the jackal.</p>

<p>A more simplistic and childish variant appears in Lang’s <em>Green Fairy Book</em>, without attribution: the wolf becomes a fox, the pigs are named, some character development is provided, and changes are made to the building materials; the sequence with the third pig tricking the fox is omitted, and there is no mention of Shanklin or other local Island features:</p>

<p>The Three Little Pigs</p>
<p>THERE was once upon a time a pig who lived with her three children on a large, comfortable, old-fashioned farmyard. The eldest of the little pigs was called Browny, the second Whitey, and the yoimgest and best looking Blacky. Now Browny was a very dirty little pig, and I am sorry to say spent most of his time rolling and wallowing about in the mud. He was never so happy as on a wet day, when the mud in the farmyard got soft, and thick, and slab. Then he would steal away from his mother’s side, and finding the muddiest place in the yard, would roll about in it and thoroughly enjoy himself. His mother often found fault with him for this, sua would shake her head sadly and say : ‘ Ah, Browny I some day yoii will be sorry that you did not obey your old mother.’ But no words of advice or warning could cure Browny of his bad habits.</p>
<p>Whitey was quite a clever little pig, but she was greedy. She was always thinking of her food, and looking forward to her dinner, and when the farm girl was seen carrying the pails across the yard she would rise up on her hind legs and dance and caper with excitement. As soon as the food was poured into the trongh she jostled Blacky and Browny out of the way in her eagerness to get the best and biggest bits for herself. Her mother often scolded her for her selfishness, and told her that some day she would sufifer for being so greedy and grabbing.</p>
<p>Blacky was a good, nice little pig, neither dirty nor greedy. He had nice dainty ways (for a pig), and his skin was always as smooth and shining as black satin. He was much cleverer than Browny and Whitey, and his mother’s heart used to swell with pride when she heard the farmer’s friends say to each other that some day the little black fellow would be a prize pig.</p>
<p>Now the time came when the mother pig felt old and feeble and near her end. One day she called the three little pigs round her and said :</p>
<p>‘ My children, I feel that I am growing old and weak, and that I shall not live long. Before I die I should like to build a house for each of you, as this dear old sty in which we have lived so happily will be given to a new family of pigs, and you will have to turn out. Now, Browny, what sort of a house would you like to have ? ‘</p>
<p>‘ A house of mud,’ replied Browny, looking longingly at a wet puddle in the comer of the yard.</p>
<p>‘ And you, Whitey ? ‘ said the mother pig in rather a sad voice, for she was disappointed that Browny had made so foolish a choice.</p>
<p>‘ A house of cabbage,’ answered Whitey, with a mouth fall, and scarcely raising her snout out of the trough in which she was grubbing for some potato-parings.</p>
<p>‘ Foolish, foolish child ! ‘ said the mother pig, looking quite distressed* * And you. Blacky ? ‘ turning to her youngest son, ‘ what sort of a house shall I order for you ? ‘</p>
<p>‘ A house of brick, please mother, as it will be warm in winter, and cool in summer, and safe all the year round.’</p>
<p>‘ That is a sensible little pig,’ replied his mother, looking fondly at him. ‘ I will see that the three houses are got ready at once. And now one last piece of advice. You have heard me talk of our old enemy the fox. When he hears that I am dead, he is sure to try and get hold of you, to carry you off to his den. He is very sly. and will no doubt disguise himself, and pretend to be a friend, but you must promise me not to let him enter your houses on any pretext whatever.’</p>
<p>And the little pigs readily promised, for they had always had a great fear of the fox, of whom they had heard many terrible tales. A short time afterwards the old pig died, and the little pigs went to live in their own houses.</p>
<p>Browny was quite delighted with his soft mud walls and with the clay floor, which soon looked like nothing but a big mud pie. But that was what Browny enjoyed, and he was as happy as possible, rolling about all day and making himself in such a mess. One day, as he was lying half asleep in the mud, he heard a soft knock at his door, and a gentle voice said :</p>
<p>‘ May I come in, Master Browny ? I want to see your beautiful new house.*</p>
<p>‘ Who are you ? ‘ said Browny, starting up in great fright, for though the voice sounded gentle, he felt sure it was a feigned voice, and he feared it was the fox.</p>
<p>‘ I am a friend come to call on you,’ answered the voice.</p>
<p>‘ No, no,’ replied Browny, ‘ I don’t believe you are a friend. You are the wicked fox, against whom our mother warned us. I won’t let you in.’</p>
<p>‘ Oho ! is that the way you answer me ? ‘ said the fox, speaking very roughly in his natural voice.  ‘ We shall soon see who is master here,’ and with his paws he set to work and scraped a large hole in the soft mud walls. A moment later he had jumped through it, and catching Browny by the neck, flung him on his shoulders and trotted off with him to his den.</p>
<p>The next day, as Whitey was munching a few leaves of cabbage out of the corner of her house, the fox stole up to her door, determined to carry her off to join her brother in his den. He began speaking to her in the same feigned gentle voice in which he had spoken to Browny; but it frightened her very much when he said :</p>
<p>‘ I am a friend come to visit you, and to have some of your good cabbage for my dinner.’</p>
<p>‘ Please don’t touch it,’ cried Whitey in great distress. ‘The cabbages are the walls of my house, and if you eat them you will make a hole, and the wind and rain will come in and give me a cold. Do go away ; I am sure you are not a friend, but our wicked enemy the fox.’ And poor Whitey began to whine and to whimper, and to wish that she had not been such a greedy little pig, and had chosen a more solid material than cabbages for her house. But it was too late now, and in another minute the fox had eaten his way through the cabbage walls, and had caught the trembling, shivering Whitey, and carried her off to his den.</p>
<p>The next day the fox started off for Blacky’s house, because he had made up his mind that he would get the three little pigs together in his den, and then kill them, and invite all his friends to a feast. But when he reached the brick house, he found that the door was bolted and barred, so in his sly manner he began, ‘ Do let me in, dear Blacky. I have brought you a present of some eggs that I picked up in a farmyard on my way here.’</p>
<p>‘ No, no. Mister Fox,’ replied Blacky, ‘ I am not going to open my door to you. I know your cunning ways. You have carried off poor Browny and Whitey, but you are not going to get me.’</p>
<p>At this the fox was so angry that he dashed with all his force against the wall, and tried to knock it down. But it was too strong and well-built ; and though the fox scraped and tore at the bricks with his paws he only hurt himself, and at last he had to give it up, and limp away with his forepaws all bleeding and sore.</p>
<p>‘ Never mind ! ‘ he cried angrily as he went off, ‘ I’ll catch yon another day, see if I don’t, and won’t I grind your bones to powder when I have got you in my den 1 ‘ and he snarled fiercely and showed his teeth.</p>
<p>Next day Blacky had to go into the neighbouring town to do some marketing and to buy a big kettle. As he was walking home with it slung over his shoulder, he heard a sound of steps stealthily creeping after him. For a moment his heart stood still with fear, and then a happy thought came to him. He had just reached the top of a hill, and could see his own little house nestling at the foot of it among the trees. In a moment he had snatched the lid off the kettle and had jumped in himself. Coiling himself round he lay quite snug in the bottom of the kettle, while with his fore-leg he managed to put the lid on, so that he was entirely hidden. With a little kick from the inside he started the kettle oflEi and down the hill it rolled fall tilt ; and when the fox came up, all that he saw was a large black kettle spinning over the ground at a great pace. Very much disappointed, he was just going to turn away, when he saw the kettle stop close to the little brick house, and in a moment later’ Blacky jumped out of it and escaped with the kettle into the house, when he barred and bolted the door, and put the shutter up over the window.</p>
<p>‘ Oho ! ‘ exclaimed the fox to himself, ‘ you think you will escape me that way, do you ? We shall soon see about that, my friend,’ and very quietly and stealthily he prowled round the house looking for some way to climb on to the roof.</p>
<p>In the meantime Blacky had filled the kettle with water, and having put it on the fire, sat down quietly waiting for it to boil. Just as the kettle was beginning to sing, and steam to come out of the spout, he heard a sound like a soft, muffled step, patter, patter, patter overhead, and the next moment the fox’s head and fore-paws were seen coming down the chinmey. But Blacky very wisely had not put the lid on the kettle, and, with a yelp of pain, the fox fell into the boiling water, and before he could escape, Blacky had popped the lid on, and the fox was scalded to death.</p>
<p>As soon as he was sure that their wicked enemy was really dead, and could do them no further harm. Blacky started off to rescue Browny and Whitey. As he approached the den he heard piteous grimts and squeals from his poor little brother and sister who lived in constant terror of the fox killing and eating them. But when they saw Blacky appear at the entrance to the den their joy knew no bounds. He quickly found a sharp stone and cut the cords by which they were tied to a stake in the ground, and then all three started off together for Blacky’ s house, where they lived happily ever after ; and Browny quite gave up rolling in the mud, and Whitey ceased to be greedy, for they never forgot how nearly these faults had brought them to an untimely end.</p>

<p>Another singular story is told on Dartmoor. There was once a fox, who, prowling by night in search of prey, came unexpectedly on a colony of pixies. Each pixy had a separate house. The first he came to was a wooden house.</p>
<p>“ Let me in, let me in,” said the fox.</p>
<p>“ I won’t,” was the pixy’s answer ; “ and the door is fastened.”</p>
<p>Upon this the fox climbed to the top of the house ; and having pawed it down, made a meal of the unfortunate pixy. The next was a “ stonen” house.</p>
<p>“ Let me in,” said the fox.</p>
<p>“ The door is fastened,” answered the pixy.</p>
<p>Again was the house pulled down, and its inmate eaten.</p>
<p>The third was an iron house. The fox again craved admittance, and was again refused.</p>
<p>“ But I bring you good news,” said the fox.</p>
<p>“ No, no,” replied the pixy ; “ I know what you want ; you shall not come in here to-night.”</p>
<p>That house the fox in vain attempted to destroy. It was too strong for him, and he went away in despair. But he returned the next night, and exerted all his fox-like qualities in the hope of deceiving the pixy. For some time he tried in vain ; until at last he mentioned a tempting field of turnips in the neighbourhood, to which he offered to conduct his intended victim. They agreed to meet the next morning at four o’clock.</p>
<p>But the pixy outwitted the fox ; for he found his way to the field, and returned laden with his turnips long before the fox was astir. The fox was greatly vexed, and was long unable to devise another scheme, until he bethought himself of a great fair about to be held a short way off, and proposed to the pixy that they should set off for it at three in the morning.</p>
<p>The pixy agreed. But the fox was again outwitted; for he was only up in time to meet the pixy returning home with his fairings — a clock, a crock, and a frying-pan. The pixy, who saw the fox coming, got into the crock and rolled himself down the hill ; and the fox, unable to find him, abandoned the scent and went his way. The fox returned the next morning ; and finding the door open went in, when he caught the pixy in bed, put him into a box, and locked him in.</p>
<p>“ Let me out,” said the pixy, “ and I will tell you a wonderful secret.”</p>
<p>The fox was after a time persuaded to lift the cover ; and the pixy, coming out, threw such a charm upon him that he was compelled to enter the box in his turn ; and there at last he died.</p>

<p>PIGWEENEY THE WISE.</p>
<p>A RESPECTABLE Sow was preparing to die,<br />
And as she lay down, on some straw in her sty,<br />
She call’d to her Children, three Piggies most dear,<br />
Who observing her ill began to look queer.</p>
<p>“ I believe, my dear Piggies, I’m going to die;”<br />
At which they thought proper to squeak and to cry.</p>
<p>“ So don’t begin squeaking, and making a rout,<br />
“ But be, like Philosophers, callous, and bold;<br />
“ Who care not for life or for death, I am told:<br />
“ The Wolf may as well lay his claw on your life,<br />
“ As be stuck in the throat by a vile Butcher’s knife;<br />
“ And then to be sing’d from the head to the tail,<br />
“ Till you look like a <em>rusty, old tenpenny nail</em>,<br />
“ And spitted-and greas’d-and put down to roast-<br />
“ Then serv’d up in a dish like a hot butter’d toast!</p>
<p>“ Now, tell me, my Child,” to the Eldest she said,<br />
“ What House shall I build thee before I be dead?-<br />
“ Shall I build it of Mud-or of Straw-or of Stone?<br />
“ But in chusing these things I must let you alone,<br />
“ For the Fairy declared you n1ust use your discretion,<br />
“ As if ye were Pigs of a <em>learned Profession</em> !”</p>
<p>“ I will have it of <em>Straw</em>— and of <em>Mud</em>- but no <em>Stone</em>”-<br />
The Eldest replied,-” and live in it alone. “ -<br />
“ My House,” said the Second, “ shall be built of all three,<br />
“ Which will keep me quite safe, if the Wolf comes near me.”-</p>
<p>“ <em>Pigweeney</em>! my Love,” said the fondest of Mothers,<br />
(Pigweeney was younger than either his Brothers)<br />
“ Come tell me of what I shall build <em>thee</em> a House,<br />
“ Of Wood, and of Wire, like the Trap of a Mouse?—<br />
“ Alas! I have no time to waste on a joke,<br />
“ For my breath is so short, I feel ready to choke!”</p>
<p>“ Oh! build it of Iron-and build it of Steel!<br />
“ And make haste, my Mother, while yet you can feel;<br />
“ For I know, by the curl of mytail in the wind,<br />
“ That the -Wolf is preparing his grinders to grind ;<br />
“ For he longs to devour us, by way of a treat,<br />
“ As he knows that our Flesh makes most delicate meat.”-</p>
<p>The Sow went to work; and each House in its place,<br />
Was seen, before “<em>Sol</em>” had half lather’d his face<br />
In the <em>mist of the Morning</em>! which, between me and you,<br />
Is nothing at all but a plentiful <em>dew</em>;<br />
But in these <em>poetical—fanciful</em> days,<br />
One must use the <em>sublime</em>, or forfeit one’s “<em>Bays</em>.”—</p>
<p>The old Mamma Sow, gave her blessing,— and died.<br />
Alas! the poor Piggies, they grunted and cried,<br />
And n1ade such a noise, that the Wolf, who was near,<br />
Soon saw how it was, as will shortly appear.<br />
“ Oh-Oh! “ cried the Monster, “the Mother is dead;<br />
“ So her Piggies I’ll eat for my dinner,” he said.<br />
But the Piggies aware of the Monster’s intention,<br />
Shut themselves in their Houses, to try his invention.</p>
<p>And now my sad story begins in this page,<br />
To relate the effects of the violent rage,<br />
Which the old wicked Wolf began to display,<br />
When he found that the Piggies, on that very day,<br />
Had got three new Houses, and plenty of food,<br />
And fresh straw-and clean troughs-and all that was good.</p>
<p>He knock’d at the door of the eldest, and said,<br />
“·So my Cousin, your Mother, I find is just dead;<br />
“ Oh! pray let me in, as I long to express,<br />
“ How wretched I feel at your present distress! “<br />
“ Indeed, I shall not, Mr. Wolf,” Pig replied;<br />
“ For my Mother declared, at the time when she died,<br />
“ That you only intended to eat us for dinner,<br />
“ Though one you would keep for your supper — you sinner.”<br />
“Oh—oh!— is it so,” said the Wolf, in a passion,<br />
Provok’ d, you perceive, at being us’d in this fashion;<br />
“ I’ll <em>scratch</em>, and I’ll <em>scrape</em> down your House,” he replied.<br />
“ Pray do, if you can, Mr. Wolf,” Piggy cried.</p>
<p>Alas! the poor Pig—how sad his condition!<br />
But the Muse, being true to a faithful tradition,<br />
Must declare all the sorrows of Pigs in distress,<br />
Whose woes we lament, but cannot redress!<br />
Imagine how great must have been his vexation,<br />
When he saw his House down to the very foundation,<br />
All scattered about like a Hillock of Hay,<br />
Which you toss with your foot on a warm summer’s day.<br />
No time had the Pig to reflect on his fate,<br />
Or to try to escape from his perilous state;<br />
The Wo1f soon devour’d him, as part of his feast,<br />
Then prowl’d to the House of the next, a vile Beast!</p>
<p>He knock’d at the door of the second, and said,-<br />
“ So my Cousin, your Mother, I find is just dead;<br />
“Oh! pray let me in, as I long to express,<br />
“ How wretched I feel at your present distress.<br />
‘Twas in vain that the Pig most politely declined<br />
To receive him just then, for indeed he had dined,<br />
And was stretched on his straw, for an afternoon’s nap,<br />
And could not get up to attend to the rap.</p>
<p>The Wo]f, in his fury, kick’d up such a rout,<br />
That the House of the Pig was <em>turn’d inside out</em>,<br />
And the innocent Pig was devour’d in a trice!<br />
For this Wolf had less feeling than Cats have for Mice,<br />
Who, sometimes, I’ve seen, in a frolicsome mood,<br />
Play gambols a while with their victims for food.</p>
<p>The Sun was just set, and the Moon, in the Sky,<br />
Had settled herself for the Night,-when the Sty,<br />
Or the House, I should say, of <em>Pigweeney the Wise</em>,<br />
Was assail’d by the Wolf, who repeated his cries,<br />
Of “ Ill <em>scratch</em>, and I’ll <em>scrape</em>, and I’ll pull down your House,<br />
“ And gobble you up as a cat would a mouse.”<br />
To work the Wolf set when he’d finish’d his speech,<br />
But he found that <em>Pigweeney</em> was out of his reach;<br />
For the Honse was so strong it oblig’d him to feel,<br />
‘Twas no joke to scratch against “ <em>Iron and Steel</em>.”</p>
<p>When the treach’rous Wolf found the Pig was secure,<br />
He determined to throw out a powerful lure,<br />
To decoy this young Pig from his place of retreat;<br />
For he burnt with revenge at his recent defeat.</p>
<p>“ Have you heard of the Fair, Pigweeney, my dear!<br />
“ On the top of the Hill, which, to.morrow, I hear,<br />
“ Will be kept all the day ?-I hope you will go,<br />
“ And take me for your guide;-pray do not say no,<br />
“ To this offer of mine, which in Friendship I make,<br />
“ For I love you, my dear, for your poor Mother’s sake;<br />
“ Do permit me to call to-morrow at nine,<br />
“ If the Roads, and the Weather, be dry and quite fine.”</p>
<p>Pigweeney replied, behind his strong door,<br />
“ Why really to walk is a <em>positive Bore!</em><br />
“ But I think, Cousin Wolf, I shall take your advice;<br />
“ As I want a new Kettle-a Trap to catch Mice,<br />
“ A Gridiron-a Spit-and a Washing Tub too,<br />
“ I’ll be ready at <em>Nine</em> to walk there with you.”</p>
<p>Next Morning Pigweeney arose with the Sun,<br />
For his mind was made up to have excellent fun<br />
With this rogue of a W olf-this wicked old Sinner,<br />
Who long’d to be munching the Pig for his dinner.</p>
<p>By <em>Six</em> the young Pig, in the midst of the Fair,<br />
Was purchasing Kettles and Crockery-ware;<br />
By <em>Seven</em> his Goods were in a Wheelbarrow,<br />
By <em>Eight</em> he was trudging in Lanes rather narrow,<br />
By <em>Nine</em> he was safe in his “<em>Iron and Steel</em>” House,<br />
Preparing his Trap to catch a vile Mouse ;<br />
At a <em>quarter past Nine</em>, by the Clock of the Church,<br />
Mr. Wolf ascertain’d he’d been <em>left in the lurch</em>;<br />
For on asking Pigweeney if ready to go,<br />
His pride and his hunger alike met a blow,<br />
In finding Pigweeney had been to the Fair,<br />
And was cleaning his Kettles, and Crockery-ware.</p>
<p>“Pigweeney, dear Coz, I really shall weep,<br />
“ If you will not allow me a look-a mere peep-<br />
“ At the things you have bought : I’m anxious to see,<br />
“ How you manag’d so well at the Fair without me.”</p>
<p>Pigweeney - Pigweeney - ‘tis treachery all !<br />
Do not listen a minute,-obey not his call :<br />
If you open your door you are lost like the Sheep,<br />
Who stray’d out of the fold for the sake of a leap.<br />
I’d relate all this story of innocent Mutton,<br />
Devour’d by this Wolf, who cared not a button,<br />
For all their intreaties, and heart-rending cries,<br />
When he ate them as fast as Fish swallow Flies!<br />
But my Story is placed in a critical state,<br />
While bewailing these Sheep and their tragical fate.</p>
<p>The wise Solomon said, “ take care of your heart,”<br />
“ For it oftentimes plays you a treach’rous part;<br />
“ And the head,” he observ’d, “ was equally bad,”<br />
So between the <em>heart</em> and the <em>head</em>, it is sad,<br />
To see what confusion and wickedness reigns,<br />
From vices in hearts, and follies in brains!</p>
<p>When Pigweeney was humble, Pigweeney was Wise;<br />
When the Y oung grow presumptuous, how soon they despise<br />
All the Lessons which Prudence and Wisdom have taught;<br />
Which Age has acquir’d from Experience bought.<br />
But I’ll finish my Moral hereafter,-and now<br />
Proceed with my Story :-Pigweeney, somehow,<br />
Was persuaded to let the old Wolf just look in,<br />
Through the Window, which rested upon his vile chin;<br />
For Pigweeney just rais’d it enough for a peep;<br />
But the Wolf began howling, pretending to weep;<br />
“ Oh tny Chin-Oh my Chin! ‘twill be sever’d in two,<br />
“ Pray let my poor Head in, I beg of you, do!”<br />
Pigweeney now lifted the Window still higher;<br />
“ It is hreaking my Neck,” said the wicked old Liar,<br />
“ I feel in such pain ‘twixt my Shoulder, and Back,<br />
“ That I verily think my Bones will soon crack.”</p>
<p>The Window was rais’d to a moderate height,<br />
When in jump’d the Wolf !-the Pig, in a fright,<br />
Ran behind his new Gridiron, more dead than alive;<br />
At this moment of horror! a Bee, from its hive,<br />
Flew into the Room, stung the Wolf in his Eye,<br />
Which Pigweeney observing, cried, “ Fly- Cousin -fly “<br />
“ I see Huntsmen, and Hounds, at the foot of the Hill,<br />
“ And hark ! - I now hear the Horn blowing shrill<br />
“ Through the Valley just by:-haste-haste far away,<br />
“ For if you stay here, they will make you their prey.”</p>
<p>“ Oh! Cousin Pigweeney, I dare not go out,”<br />
Said the cowardly Wolf,-” Pray do look about<br />
“ For a safe hiding place, in which I may wait,<br />
“ And I pray you make haste as they’re just at your Gate.”</p>
<p>“ See,-here is my Kettle-so big-and so wide”-<br />
Said the Pig, “in which you can easily hide;”—<br />
In went the Wolf—down went the lid-<br />
“ Stay there,” said Pigweeney, “ and do as I bid,<br />
“ I will tell you the time when the Hounds shall have past,<br />
“Now, I’ll run to the Window, and make it quite fast.”</p>
<p>‘Twas not to the Window Pigweeney did go,<br />
He ran to the Fire, and beginning to blow,<br />
Very soon made a Kettle of Water quite hot,<br />
“ Then lifted the Cover, and into the Pot,<br />
All over the Wolf, pour’d the scalding hot water;<br />
For the Pig had determin’d to give him no quarter.<br />
When the Wolf op’d his Mouth to express his surprise,<br />
Down wenr the hot stream! out went both his eyes!—<br />
He made a great Yell-stretched himself on his side-<br />
Hung over the edge of the Kettle-and died!</p>
<p>And now for my Moral ;-you’ll own its but fair,<br />
That our Lives should command our particular care :<br />
And self-int’rest, you know, has its natural source<br />
In a love for ourselves as a matter of course;-<br />
On this same opinion, a Poet, of note *,<br />
Esteem’d for his sense, thus facetiously wrote ;<br />
“ ‘Tis self-defence in each profession,<br />
“ Sure self-defence is no transgression.”—</p>
