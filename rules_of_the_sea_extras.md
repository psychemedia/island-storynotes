law maritime jettison p. ix
The law of Maritime Jetison, for instance, as set forth in the thirty-eighth chapter of the compilation of Laws published in the fourth year of William the Conqueror (A.D. 1070) as the Laws of King Edward the Confessor, is the affirmation of a rule by which questions of maritime jetison were then governed, which is not identical with the ancient Law of Rome (Digest, 1. xiv. t. 11), but accords with a more modern usage, such as we find subsequently reduced into writing in the Rolls of Olero
Oleron xxvi and onwards

None of thoſe Goods which are called Jetſam (from being Caſt into the Sea while the Ship is in Danger, and after Periſh- 4 eth) or thoſe called Flotſam (from Hoating upon the Sea after Ship- *; wreck) or thoſe called Lagan or Ligan (Goods ſunk in the Sea but 11 tied to a Buoy, (Fc. that they may be found again after Shipwreck) _—_— are to be eſteemed Wreck, ſo long as they remain upon the Sea, and are not caſt upon the Land by the Sea.

And Sir John Popham Chict Juſtice ſaid, That in trial of a Nife between the City of Briſtow and the Lord Berkley, it was holden by the Juſtices of Afliſe #That wh the Lord Berkley had a Mannor adjoyning to the Severn, and preſcribed to bave wreck within his nor, and certain goods floted between the high Water and low wates mark, ,and the City of Brifll Flotſam there z And it was holden that the ſaid goods were not wreck as Jong as they were flotingyy the water between high water and low water mark. Sce the Book in 5 E. 3. 3. in a Replevin brayt by William de N, of London againſt Sir Henry Newil, and counted that the Defcndant took thre of Herrings, and a Ship and the Defendant pleaded that he was Lord of the Mannor of Warling, ul preſcribed to have wreck within his Mannor, and that the Herring and Ship were wreck within Mannor : To which the Plaintiff ſaid, that they were our goods in the keeping of the Mariners whi arrived by the Sea,and that he took them out of their cuſtody : Judgment if he can claim as wreck? which the Defendant ſaid, we took them as wreck, Hors de.cheſcun gard 3 upon,which Book I oblen three things, 1.

One preſabd to have royal Fiſhes, as Porps, 6c. found within his Mannor, that it ſecmeth to be between the highal low water mark. _- SE | |

3+ It was reſolved, That the King ſhall have Flotſam, Jetſam, & Lagan, when the Ship periſhah 0 when the Owners of the goods are known, as in 46 E, 3.15. appeareth, that goods caſt into te for fear of tempelt are not forfeit. Vide Fe..N.

Ttem ſine traditione res babita pro derelift”, ubi Domink fat deſinit eſſe Dominus, fi autem cauſa navis alleviande, non fic, quia non ea voluntate tjecit quis, ut deſuat 4 Dominus. And a man may have Flotſam and. Jetſam by. the Kings Grant, and may have Flotſam witiW the high and low water marks by preſcription, as it appeareth before. And thoſe of the Weſt Count preſcribe to have wreck in the Sea ſo far as they may ſee a Humber barrel.

4. It was reſolved, that the Statute of We. 2. cap. 4. by which it is enacted, That of wreck of tt Sea it is agreed, that there where a man, dog, or cat, eſcape alive out of the Ship or Veſſel, not thing within them ſhall be adjudged wreck, byt the goods ſhall be ſaved and kept by the view of Sheriff , Coroner, or Kings Bayliff, 8c. ſo that if any ſue for thoſe goods, and can prove i they belonged to him, or that they periſhed - in his keeping within a year and a day, they {hall be ſtored to him without delay, &c. was but a declaration of the Common Law ; and therefore all that which is provided as to wreck, extendeth alſo to Flotſam, Jetſam, and Lagan.

And in Treſpaſs the Plaintiff ſhall recover damages only for the value of the goods, and for hat in this cauſe Judgment was given againſt the Plaintiff, And the Book in 21 H. 7. 43. was cited, where the A_ Caſe is, That in Treſpaſs the Defendant juſtifieth as to one thing, and pleadeth Not Guilty of another, and theyare at iſſue, and the Jury enquired of one thing only, and taxed the damages for both entirely. ' Fineux hed the verdict good for the thing found, and that he ſhould have a Writ of Enquiry of dam; apes, Qyod fit negatum per totam Curiam. Dier 22 Eliz. 269. in Ejectione cuſtodie agreeth with this Judgment, And it was adjudged M. 14 & 15 Eliz. in this Court in Treſpais by Pooly againſt Osburn of ing his Cloſe and. beating his ſervant, and doth not fay, per quod ſervitium amiſit, the Defendant pleaded Not Guilty, and the} urors found him gulty and aſſeſſed damages intirely ; and becauſe the | Plaintiff had not cauſe of Action for beating of his ſervant, becauſe he hath not averred that he loſt his ſervice, for this cauſe the Plaintiff took nothing by his Bill.

Rot. 476. where the Defendant promiſed to do divers things, and the Plaintiff alledged two breaches, whereof one was inſufficient, the Defendant pleaded Non afſumpfit, the Jury gave damage generally. . It was reſolved, 1. That it ſhall be intended that they gave damages for both : 2. That for as much as the Phintiff had no cauſe of :damages for the one, for this cauſe the Judgment given for the Plaintiff in the Kage Bench was reverſed by a Writ of Error brought in the Exchequer Chamber. | NoteReader, at the firſt, the Common Law gave as well Wreck ,, Fetſam,” Flotſam, and Logan upon the Sea, as Eftray (which BraGon calleth animalia vagantia) or as other call them animalia vacantia, quiz Domino vateri debent, treaſure trove, and the like to the King, becauſe that by the rule of the Common Law, 'when no man can claim property in any goods, the King ſhall have them by his Prerogative.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flotsam,_jetsam,_lagan_and_derelict
In terms of maritime law, the definition of flotsam pertains to goods that are floating on the surface of the water as the result of a wreck or an accident. As there is no clear way of defining ownership, one who discovers flotsam is allowed to claim it, unless someone claims ownership to the items in question.

Jetsam designates any cargo that is intentionally discarded from a ship or wreckage. Legally jetsam also floats, although floating is not part of the etymological meaning.[8] Generally, "jettisoning" connotes the action of throwing goods overboard to lighten the load of the ship if it is in danger of sinking.Per maritime law, one who discovers these artifacts is not required to return them to their rightful owner except in the case that the latter makes a legally abiding claim

[https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/flotsam-jetsam.html Flotsam may be claimed by the original owner, whereas jetsam may be claimed as property of whoever discovers it.]
Lagan  (also called "ligan") refers to goods that are cast overboard and are heavy enough to sink to the ocean floor, but are tied or otherwise linked to a floating marker, such as a buoy or cork, so that they can be found again by whoever marked the item. Lagan can also refer to large objects that are trapped within the sinking vessel. According to maritime law, a buoy, or otherwise floating object, constitutes as sufficient grounds in laying claim to an artifact. In other words, when faced with a lagan, one is required to return the artifact to its rightful owner
Derelict can refer to goods that have sunk to the ocean floor, relinquished willingly or forcefully by its owner, and thus abandoned, but which no one has any hope of reclaiming.In terms of maritime law, derelict is considered property abandoned on navigable waters which has no hope of being recovered, or sine spe recuperandi, and no expectation of it being returned to its owner

If a ship or other vessel arriving at any place, and making in towards a port or harbor, set out her flag, or give any other sign to have a pilot come aboard, or a boat to tow her into the harbor, the wind or tide being contrary, and a contract be made for piloting the said vessel into the said harbor accordingly; but by reason of an unreasonable and accursed custom, in some places, that the third or fourth part of the ships that are lost, shall accrue to the lord of the place where such sad casualties happen, as also the like proportion to the salvors, and only the remainder to the master, merchant and mariners: the persons contracting for the pilotage of the said vessel, to ingratiate themselves with their lords, and to gain to themselves a part of the ship and lading, do like faithless and treacherous villains, sometimes even willingly, and out of design to ruin ship and goods, guide and bring her upon the rocks, and then feigning to aid, help and assist, the now distressed mariners, are the first in dismembering and pulling the ship to pieces; purloining and carrying away the lading thereof contrary to all reason and good conscience: and afterwards that they may be the more welcome to their lord, do with all speed post to his house with the sad narrative of this unhappy disaster; whereupon the said lord, with his retinue appearing at the places, takes his share; the salvors theirs; and what remains the merchant and mariners may have. But seeing this is contrary to the law of God, our edict and determination is, that notwithstanding any law or custom to the contrary, it is said and ordained, the said lord of that place, salvors, and all others that take away any of the said goods, shall be accursed and excommunicated, and punished as robbers and thieves, as formerly hath been declared. But all false and treacherous pilots shall be condemned to suffer a most rigorous and unmerciful death; and high gibbets shall be erected for them in the same place, or as high as conveniently may be, where they so guided and brought any ship or vessel to ruin as aforesaid, and thereon these accursed pilots are with ignominy and much shame to end their days; which said gibbets are to abide and remain to succeeding ages on that place, as a visible caution to other ships that shall afterwards sail thereby.

Article XXVI

If the lord of any place be so barbarous, as not only to permit such inhuman people, but also to maintain and assist them in such villainies, that he may have a share in such wrecks, the said lord shall be apprehended, and all his goods confiscated and sold, in order to make restitution to such as of right it appertaineth; and himself to be fastened to a post or stake in the midst of his own mansion house, which being fired at the four corners, all shall be burnt together, the walls thereof shall be demolished, the stones pulled down, and the place converted into a market place for the sale only of hogs and swine to all posterity.


Article XXX

If a ship or other vessel entering into harbor, happens by misfortune to be broken and perish, and the master, mariners and merchants, which were on board her, be all drowned; and if the goods thereof be driven ashore, or remain floating on the sea, without being sought after by those to whom they belong, they being ignorant of this said disaster, and knowing nothing thereof in this most lamentable case, the lord of that place or country ought to send persons to save the said goods, which he ought to secure and to put into safe custody; and give the relations of the deceased persons who were drowned, notice of it, and to satisfy for the salvage thereof, not out of his own purse, but of the goods saved, according to the hazards run, and the pains taken therein; and what remains must be kept in safe custody for one year or more; and if in that time they to whom the said goods appertain, do not appear and claim the same, and the said year be fully expired, he may publicly sell and dispose thereof to such as will give most, and with the monies proceeding of the sale thereof, he ought to give among the poor, and for portions to poor maids, and other charitable uses, according to reason and good conscience. But if he assumes the said goods either in whole or in part unto himself, he shall incur the curse and malediction of our mother the holy church, with the aforesaid pains and penalties, without ever obtaining remission, unless he make satisfaction.



https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Book_of_the_Admiralty
a compilation of English admiralty law created over the course of several English monarchs' reigns, including the most important decisions of the High Court of Admiralty. Its starting point is the Rolls of Oléron.

The book itself states that the High Court of Admiralty was established during the reign of Edward I (1272–1307), although more recent scholarship places the establishment at c. 1360 during the reign of Edward III.[1] Apart from the Rolls of Oléron, the earliest statute referred to is the Liber memorandorum (1338), of which a separate manuscript copy is available in the archives of the City of London.[1]
