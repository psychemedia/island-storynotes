BRITISH ARCHAEOLOGICAL ASSOCIATION. NEWPORT, ISLE OF WIGHT, AUG. 23.

The members of this association made an excursion to Puckaster Cove, visiting Niton and other churches in their route. 

Yesterday evening various relics were exhibited at the Town-hall. Among other things a picture of the distribution of the Tichborne Dole attracted much attention, and was explained in a paper contributed by Mr. Baigent on the subject. The following was given as the origin of this ancient and curious custom. When the Lady Mabella, one of the house of Tichborne, worn out with infirmity and age, waa lying on her death-bed, she besought her husband that he would grant the means of leaving a charitable bequest, in a dole of bread, to be distributed to all who should apply ; whereupon he offered to give her the produce of as much land as she could crawl round, she being bed-ridden, while a faggot of wood was burning. She accepted the offer, and, being placed in the park, crawled round 32 acres in the specified time. The field in question was situated near the entrance of the park, and still retained the name of Crawls. The produce of this land was sufficient for 1,400 loaves, weighing 22 ounces each, which were for centuries distributed to all corners ; and the painting exhibited a representation of the distribution in 1670, and was very valuable as portraying the costume of the period. The distribution is now confined to the parish only.

The Rev. Mr. Kell then read a valuable and interesting paper with reference to the ancient tin trade of the Isle of Wight, proving by an immense mass of authorities that the tin which formed the subject of traffic in the early ages was brought from Cornwall across to the Isle of Wight.

This paper was follnwe'l by a lively discussion, after which the company separated for the day.
