# Mackerel Fishing

If you had been sitting out on St Catherine's Down, overlooking Chale Bay, in May or early June, a hundred and fifty years or so ago, it's quite likely that you'd be sitting there waiting for the sea to turn an inky black with the arrival of large shoals of mackerel.

THE MACKEREL FISHERS.

May morn has come. A sunny day  
Succeeds each hazy night.  
Soft breezes o'er the water play  
And ripple to the sight.  
The wavelets lap the shingly shore  
In gently murm'ring swell,  
So look across the waters for  
The playful mackerel.

In multitudes the silvery brood  
Will visit strait or bay;  
A lively throng, they search for food,  
Or sport in finny play:  
The surface blue they peep above,  
Dart through the deep like light,  
And make, as on their course they move,  
A truly charming sight.

Run out the boat! Man every oar!  
The simple net prepare!  
Speed swiftly, swiftly from the shore!  
Pull, mates—yet pull with care!  
The net is shot; the boat wears round;  
The fish are in the toils;  
Row, row the gallant craft aground,  
Then haul ashore the spoils!

Yo-ho! Heave-ho! an aiding hand  
Each landsman lends in glee,  
And soon upon the pebbly strand  
A wondrous sight all see.  
There, drawn from out the briny deep,  
Promiscuously, pell-mell,  
Lie leaping, gasping, in a heap,  
The silvery mackerel.

The sunburnt, stalwart fishermen  
Survey with open glee  
The sight presented to their ken,—  
This harvest of the sea;  
For days of toil and long suspense  
Repaid are now full well,  
As sturdily they bear off hence  
The silvery mackerel.  

Chale, I.W. — G. A.

BLACKGANG.

The mackerel season in the Isle of Wight, which is hailed with much delight by the fishermen, commenced at Blackgang on Saturday last, and since that many thousands of this favourite fish have been caught on the coast. The Chale bay mackerel have for many years been in great requisition in the south of England: in fact, Chale was the only part of this coast where they were caught until very recently, when a party of fishermen tried the experiment at Sandown. It proved successful, and since then large numbers have been caught there at different times, but the coast is not so well adapted for mackerel catching as at Blackgang, where the water is deep very close to the beach, and thus the mackerel come near shore to feed on the smaller fish. The shoals are quite distinguishable on the surface of the water, where they play in and out, which gives the spot the appearance of ink in the water. The number of fish in a shoal may be judged from the size and blackness of the spot. When the shoal is sufficiently near the beach, one end of a net is left on the shore and a boat with the remainder puts off, throwing the net overboard as they proceed, and make a complete circle round the shoal. Landing again they immediately commence to pull the net to shore, and unless it hangs in a rock and tears, or the fish are too sharp for them and escape before the circle is completed, a goodly number of fish, "all alivo," reward the fishermen for their pains, and an uncommonly pretty sight it is as the fish are being taken out of the water. In the net they appear to be of all the colors of the rainbow.

A great need has been supplied at the back of the Island, viz., a resident agent for Lloyd's. This coast is often visited with heavy storms of wind from the south-west, and wrecks are the frequent consequence, but until now there has been no one to act for the benefit of the owners of wrecked ships or for the underwriters nearer than Yarmouth or Cowes, and thus it has frequently happened that much valuable time has been lost before the arrival of the agent. We now understand that Messrs. Dabell and Son, of Blackgang Chine, have instructions to act as sub-agents for Mr. Day, of Cowes, who is agent for Lloyd's and consulate of the Netherlands, Belgium, North Germany, France, &c.
```

In one year at least, it seems the mackerel were coming in particular close to the shore, and bringing sharks along in their wake:

[Isle of Wight Observer - Saturday 21 June 1856](https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000170/18560621/007/0003)

The coast of the Solent have been visited within these last few weeks by immense shoals of mackerel, which are very seldom witnessed inside of the Isle of Wight. They come so close on shore that people would almost imagine that they could be easily caught in a small shrimping net. Fishermen about the neighbourhood appear to very negligent not to make an attempt to throw their nets, and in consequence the fishes have roving commission to go where they please. They are becoming more numerous along our shores every day, and there are in fact fish of all kinds paying a visit in the quiet waters of the Solent Channel; even the shark species are making themselves acquainted with this locality, and we are informed one of those savage monsters nearly bolted a man last week whilst bathing in Colwell Bay, but fortunately he made every possible speed and got away from him after having a great struggle with the brute by diving and dodging before he could make an escape to the shore.

```

In other years, it seems that porpoises would play along:

An unusual spectacle was seen off Southsea Castle on Sunday evening, when a shoal of porpoises was observed disporting themselves as they were going out to sea with the running tide. As Southsea Esplanade was occupied by some thousands of promenaders, the porpoises were watched with the keenest interest. It is well known that porpoises follow in the wake of mackerel, and it is probable we shall hear of some heavy catches in neighbouring waters.

Each year, beginning as early as the start of May, the first catch of the mackerel season would be announced in the local newspapers, often with an indication of the size of the catch and the prices returned:

Mackerel Fishing.—By this time last year we had the pleasure of announcing the arrival in our bay of some pretty strong shoals of mackerel, and very welcome visitors they were considered by all parties. For this past week or two our bay fishermen have been on the alert for their re-appearance, but unfortunately without success up to the present. One or two shoals have been sighted, but yet they have testified no inclination to make a stay in the bay. However, there is time for them yet, and we are sure when they do come our fishermen will welcome them with a "come as often as you like, and stay as long as you like."

Then there are the Isle of Wight Militia here for their drill. Last, but not least, the navvies who work at the fort. If variety be charming, we have it here; but the place is orderly.

BIG HAULS OF MACKEREL.

The mackerel fishing season off the Isle of Wight was opened with remarkable catches. Trawling in Chale Bay, the Sandown fishermen have netted no fewer than 18,000, which have been taken direct to Portsmouth. A message received at Sandown, yesterday, stated that the Chale fishermen had come ashore with a 20,000 catch.

Perhaps counter-intuitively, if the hauls were large, fish might be returned to the sea rather than depress prices on individual items in a catch.

VENTNOR

MACKEREL—Large quantities of mackerel have been caught off here during the past week, consequently the price has been much lower than usual, the fish having been procurable for 10 and 12 a shilling, the usual price being four a shilling. It is considered cheap if the fish can be obtained at 2d. each. Many of the catches have purchased by Frampton and Sons, fishmongers, who have despatched some thousands to Newport, Cowes, &c. The local boatmen and fishermen have also engaged in these mackerel speculations, purchasing from the Channel boats as brought in. This, together with Messrs. Frampton's enterprise, has combined to reduce the price of mackerel this season. It is remarkable that none of the fish have yet been caught in Chale Bay this year, as usually large numbers of shoals are netted here. This is attributed to the to the *(sic)* comparatively cold whether *(sic)*, which tends to keep the fish at sea. The shoals are getting closer this week, as on Tuesday night the boats caught their fish only several miles from shore, whereas they have been casting their nets halfway across the Channel.

We have had a larger supply of mackerel from the back of the Wight this season, than has been known for some years past, and during one hall the fishermen intentionally let about 20,000 escape, stating their reason for so doing— that they should have to sell them proportionally cheaper, therefore they would be of no advantage to them.

Hay-making is now pretty general in this neighbourhood, and the swoaths are heavy. The wheat, barley and oats also look well.

The market could also be affected by other matters. The loss of HMS Eurydice in March 1878, with the loss of almost all her crew, seems to have tainted the local desire, at least, to reap the piscine harvest of sea.

A New Drawback to the Fishmonger. — The recent melancholy accidents which have caused so many corpses to be floating in these waters have created in some minds an unconquerable aversion to fish, which are just now very numerous. The whole of the finny tribe, and the crustaceous, such as crabs, lobsters, shrimps, &c,, are credited with making many a good meal on the body of submerged sailors. We have no doubt that such is the case, and that the dreadfully mutilated state of the bodies washed on shore is due to their depredations, so that there is some cause for the prejudice to which we have referred. At all events a man who was crying Chale Bay mackerel this week soon altered his cry when he found how scarce his customers were. An amusing incident is said to have occurred the other day. An old lady was cheapening some "Chale Bay" mackerel with a street fish-monger, when a woman passed by, and noticing the lady handling the fish, observed, "Oh ma'am, I wouldn't have none of them fish if I was you. Last night my husband bought one, and when we cut it open we found two brass buttons and a piece of blue serge inside it." The old lady dropped the fish as quickly as if it had been a hot potato, and incontinently fled. What the fish hawker said to the woman who had lost him his customer our deponent sayeth not— but it was doubtless something kind and complimentary.
```

As well as the mackerel fishing, the Island also supported a trade in shell-fish, although a bad year for one might also indicate a bad year for the other:

A great deal has been said and written of late years about our fisheries; not only in animadversion of the pollution of rivers to the destruction of freshwater fish; of the obstructions placed by cupidity in the way of the migration and consequent propagation of salmon; but also of the non-development of our deep-sea fisheries. We simply intend to localise the subject, and bring a few facts before the notice of our readers; it has more interest than at first sight appears. For ages, the Isle of Wight has been celebrated for the quantity and quality of its shell-fish, especially crabs and lobsters, which afford a source of livelihood to scores of families and of luxury to the well-to-do. Last year, owing to the cold weather, those fish would not come into shallow water spawn amongst the extensive bed of rocks stretching from Bembridge Ledge to Rockenend; consequently, the "take" of the whole season scarcely amounted to that usually taken at one tide. The great prawn ground at Bembridge was almost forsaken from the like cause; and the accustomed shoals of mackerel at the "back of the Island" were also minus. It is easy, then, to imagine that a considerable amount of distress was engendered by these combined failures, which must have fallen very heavily upon a deserving and industrious race of men. But Coventry weavers and Syrian murderers monopolised all the charity, and our native fishermen tided over a terrible winter as they could; and we are interested to know what are their prospects of the present year. As far as it as gone they are bad; for cold weather again prevails. So crustaceous fish keep out in deep water where they cannot be taken; and, up to the day we write, not a single shoal of mackerel has come up, though we have reached Whitsuntide, whereas, in more favorable times, between Easter and Whitsuntide hundreds of pounds' worth have been taken and sent to the London and local markets. Thus, at one blow, the public is deprived of excellent articles of diet, and lots of families are deprived of their sole source of income. We are not aware that any steps can be taken remedy this state of things; but we are of opinion that deep-sea fishing is sadly neglected around our immediate coast, and a great mine of wealth is thus left untouched. This opinion is not the result of guess work, but is based upon our experience of what is done occasionally when a yachtsman choose for sport to cast a net; for we have known almost miraculous draughts of fishes taken on such occasions. Moreover, as our Channel is replenished twice every twenty-four hours from the Atlantic Ocean, doubtless no amount of fishing would lessen the supply. Of course we are aware that the capital at the disposal of our present fishermen is of too limited a nature to enable them to embark in an undertaking of this character, as it would require vessels of great tonnage and nets of considerable size. The subject is of national importance, and it opens a speculation for joint-stock companies of far more legitimate kind than many now entered upon. Simultaneously with the neglect of this branch of fishing, another branch, the supply of which is limited, is worked almost to destruction; namely, that of oyster dredging. Our chief oyster ground is of small extent, and is comprised between Ryde and Cowes, and formerly was dredged by fishermen living about the spot; but within the last few years it is nothing unusual to see daily during the season a fleet of 50 or 60 vessels fishing over the ground, and the produce they obtain is sent to be laid down at Colchester and other favoured spots, including the Seine. Our native fishermen assure us that this over-working of the beds must soon prove destructive to the fish, the more especially as the "foreigners" (as all strangers are called) secure the young ones which used to be always thrown back for another year. As the whole subject of our fisheries is now being dealt with by a legislative enactment, we throw out these few hints so as to enable Mr. Clifford to judge whether the matter is worthy of his consideration or not; but this we can assure him, it is one deeply concerning many of his constituents.

BAD MACKEREL SEASON

Reviewing the fishing season in the Southern Sea Fisheries District during the quarter, Captain A. F. Masters, the chief fishery officer for the district, reports that for mackerel it was one of the worst seasons on record. Trawling showed an improvement when :the' weather was favourable, except in the Solent where it met with poor results.

Crab and lobster potting was very good, and fair prices were realised, while prawning was about the average throughout the whole district, and in the Solent above the average. Shrimp trawling in the Solent is described as having been very poor, and is attributable to the presence of oil on the water by the shores.

## A Dangerous Business?

Although not subjected to the trials of deep sea fishing, mackerel fishing was not without its own attendant risks:

MACKEREL.— Many thousands of mackerel have been taken in Chale Bay during the last twelve days. We regret to hear that a man named Sprake, of Chale, who had been engaged in fishing, fell overboard, off Freshwater Gate, about 6 p.m. on Sunday, and was drowned.

FRESHWATER.

A FATAL BOAT ACCIDENT— occurred at Freshwater Gate, on Sunday evening, one life being sacrificed. These men had come from Chale to Freshwater Gate with a cargo of mackerel, and after disposing of their fish were returning home, when something wrong occurred to the sails, and one of the men named Charles Sprake, of Chale, went up the mast to put it right and overbalanced the boat, which immediately capsized, carrying the poor man with it, and he was never seen to rise. The others were saved by the prompt assistance of the coastguards stationed at the Gate. The body has not been recovered.

A TIMELEY RESCUE— A fisherman named Sothcott, who had been out in the bay mackerel fishing on Tuesday evening, was compelled to row back in consequence of the wind having fallen. He therefore came along close to the shore, and when near the Culver Cliff, he saw a young man struggling in the water and managed to rescue him. He brought him in in an unconscious state to the King's Head Hotel, where he afterwards recovered. The young man who was thus so providentially saved, is said to be a visitor stopping at Ryde, and to have been attempting to walk round the cliff by the shore when he was carried away by the tide.

EXTRAORDINARY RESCUE FROM DROWNING AT THE CULVER CLIFFS.

On Tuesday evening, a young boatman of Sandown, named Harry Sothcott, was rounding the Culver's in a boat, having been mackerel fishing all day, and when between the "Shag Rock," and the "White Horse," his attention was attracted by a sound resembling the groans of a human being in distress. Rowing close under the cliffs, the groans became more and more distinct, and carefully scanning the rocks at the foot of the cliffs, he descried a human hand clinging to a rock. Sothcott called out cheerily to the man to try and keep afloat until he could reach him with the boat; but he appeared too exhausted to make any effort, and letting go his hold upon the rock, disappeared beneath the water, rising to the surface about 15 yards from the boat. At this critical moment, Sothcott came alongside and seized hold of the drowning man's fingers a foot or so below the water, and with great effort got him into his boat. The young man was completely insensible, and all efforts to restore him which were made by his rescuer appeared to be of no avail. Under these discouraging circumstances, Sothcott made the best of his way towards home, and on reaching the Redcliffe Battery fortunately obtained the assistance of a soldier to help him in rowing to Sandown; on arrival at which place, the sufferer was taken to the King's Head Hotel, where every means of resuscitation were resorted to, and happily proved so far successful as to enable his being placed in bed and restoratives administered. In the morning he was so far recovered as to enable him to proceed to Ryde, from whence he came. It appeared the young gentleman had foolishly attempted to pass round the Culvers to Whitecliff (at all times a most perilous proceeding,) and had become baffled by the rising tide. Hemmed in by the tide, which was just at the turn, he appears to have scrambled from rock to rock, and over the huge boulders which lie at the foot of the cliffs covered with sea-weed, rendering progress, at any time, next to impossible, but trebly so at the time of tide when the rash young man essayed the attempt. In this position, we are told, he remained for fully two hours, totally beyond any chance of making his position known or prospect of accidental discovery and rescue except from a boat passing close to the cliffs, which may be regarded as a rare occurrence at this time of the year; and had it not been for the almost miraculous appearance of young Sothcott's boat in that little-frequented spot, the fate of the unfortunate young man would have been decided in a few minutes, as he had already twice disappeared beneath the waters, and was sinking a third time when Sothcott's attention was attracted to the spot. The agony both mental and physical which the young man must have gone through during that awful two hours' fight for life can be better imagined than described.

On a couple of occasions, it also seems as if there were risks associated with transporting the mackerel along the road to Newport.

...

Serious Accident on the Road. — On Saturday, between 12 and 1 o'clock, Mrs. Heal, whose husband resides at Chale and is engaged in the mackerel fishery, was driving a pony in a light market van towards Newport, and when close by Cox's-corner, in the parish of Gatcombe, where the highway is very narrow, she met a waggon and horses coming from Newport at a dangerous pace. She became alarmed at the danger, and was in the act of turning the pony to draw up under the hedge or turn back, when the waggon shaft caught the pony and threw him down. The poor woman was thrown out and her arm was broken; one of the pony's fore legs and his snout were broken by the waggon wheels, and the van was smashed. An end was quickly put to the pony's sufferings, and Mr. R. Urry, of Hilt Farm, Gatcombe, carefully took Mrs. Heal to her home at Chale, where she was attended by Mr. Homan, surgeon, of Niton. She now lies dangerously ill. The team belonged to Mr. Morgan, of Roslin Farm, near Chillerton. It is said that the horses were very fresh, and the man in charge had lost control over them.

SATURDAY.—Before Admiral Sir A. S. Hamond, bart. (chairman), and. W. G. Shedden, Mayor.

*William Jones*, a child of 11 years of age, was charged by James Netten, fishmonger, West Cowes, with embezzlement.—The prosecutor said that the prisoner was in his employ, and it was his duty go round and receive orders. That on the morning of the 2nd of May he sent him with six mackerel over to Sir Trevor Wheeler's, Tower-hill House, East Cowes Park, as on the previous week the prisoner had told him that his aunt was come there as a cook, and that the family would be there on Monday, and that he had to go on Monday morning for orders. On the Monday morning he sent six mackerel to see if they would like to have them. At half-past 12 o'clock he came back and said they liked them very much, and he was to send up six more, which he gave him and he took them away. About 1 o'clock he returned and said he had cleaned them. On the morning of the 6th he went there himself, and found it shut up, and a board to let put up. He made enquiries and found no such person, neither had the house been let. The prisoner had told him that they would pay the 1st every month. On the afternoon of the 6th the prisoner was brought up to his house in the custody of the police, and he asked him what he had done with the fish he had taken away, and told him to tell the truth, but held out neither promise nor threat to him. The prisoner said he sold six fish to Mr. Young for 1s., and the other six to Mr. Harris.—Examined Mr. Hooper, who appeared for the prisoner: It was not until Friday that he went to the house. He saw two women there cleaning the house, who wets sent by Mr. Furner. The house had not been let. He knew the women were no relation to the prisoner. He had never said that, if his mother gave him anything, he would abandon the prosecution.—Mr. Hooper addressed the Bench on behalf of the prisoner. He said the lad went to the house as he was instructed, and found the two women there, who took in the fish; and gave him the order to bring more, and supplied the order.— The Bench, however, in expressing sorrow for a child of his tender age to be charged with such an offence, sentenced him to six weeks' imprisonment, with such hard labour befitting his age.—Besides the above, he appears have got rid of much more in the same way: on the 3rd of May, 100 prawns, eight pounds of salmon, and one lobster; on the 4th, one pair of soles and 100 prawns; on the 6th, one turbet and one lobster.

We have always considered the question of hawking a very difficult one to deal with; and it is strongly illustrated in Ryde at the present time. A fortnight ago the Commissioners prosecuted several parties for hawking perishable commodities; the consequence is, that vessels have since arrived loaded with mackerel, and the greater part of the cargoes brought on shore has spoiled. Here, then, is the anomoly of a good demand and a good supply, with the natural mode of distribution so interfered with as to neutralise both. The same may be said, with regard to other articles.

BOROUGH COURT

Monday. Before the Mayor (B. Barrow, Esq.), A. F. Leeds, Esq., George Rendall, Esq., H. D. Brown, Esq., and Gen. Jeffreys.

...

SELLING FISH WITHOUT A MARKET TICKET.

*Henry William Frampton*, fishmonger, of Castle-street, was summoned for exposing fish for sale in High-street, without taking a ticket.— Mr. T. White defended.

P.C Burton deposed that on Saturday, the 12th, about a quarter to 9pm, he saw defendant hawking fish in the High-street, and asked him if he had a ticket. He said, "I forgot to get a ticket." To a boy who was standing by he said, "Run down and get two tickets." Shortly before 10 he saw defendant again, and asked him if he had a ticket. He said, "No, Mr. Buckett was not in." I told him he ought to get tickets the same as other people.

Cross-examined by Mr. White.— He had a large quantity of mackerel. He had been there some time selling the mackerel when I saw him.

Henry Buckett said he was market-keeper, and knew Frampton. He did not take a market ticket on Saturday week. Witness was not from home that evening. He stood at the Town-hall door from half-past 7 till half-past 10. The room was let. Anybody could have got a ticket who applied for it.

Mr. White, in defence, contended that this was a very hard case. The defendant was a fish salesman, and it happened that on this particular evening he had some mackerel unexpectedly sent from over the water. As the Bench were aware, mackerel was a fish which would not keep long, and he immediately went to that part of the town where these fish were regularly sold— the top of High-street. He forgot to take a ticket, but the policeman reminding him he had not done so, he immediately sent a boy for one, who could not get it. What was he to do? Was he to stop selling the fish and allow them to perish? Under the old regulations he believed there was an exception made in favour of mackerel, because it was such a perishable fish, and its ready sale was considered such a benefit to the poorer classes. He contended the defendant had done no harm but that he had really greatly benefitted the public, and under the exceptional circumstances he had alluded to did not deserve punishment.

The Mayor said that other fishmongers came and got tickets on the evening alluded to, and defendant could have done the same, and they had the evidence of Buckett that he had not been away from the Town-hall all the evening.

Defendant was fined 1s., and costs.

There was a second charge against the defendant of obstructing the High-street, at the same time and place.

P.S. Hinks said that at 7.55 he saw the defendant in High-street, opposite Mr. Keet's shop. Told him to go on further and not stand in one place so long. He had a barrow with him and a truck. He again saw defendant in the same place and spoke to him again. Instead of moving on, he told a young man named Penfold to draw some trucks by the side of his barrow. He created a great obstruction, and people had to go off the pavement to get round. If defendant had not placed his truck there the road would not have been obstructed.

Mr. White said that the bye-law under which these proceedings were taken stated that defendant was not to wait about longer than was necessary for loading and unloading. In this case the defendant only stayed while he was unloading. He had not unloaded his cart of his fish, and when he had he went away. As for the crowd, that was caused by the joy of the people at seeing such a fine lot of mackerel come into the town. Mr. Keet (opposite whose shop defendant had stopped) was asked by defendant whether he objected to his remaining there. He said, "Oh no; glad to see you there, and hope you will sell your fish."

Defendant was fined 6d., and costs.

...

SELLING MACKEREL IN THE HIGH STREET WITHOUT A TICKET

*Henry William Frampton*, fishmonger, Castle Street, was charged with unlawfully offering and exposing for sale certain marketable things in High Street, that not being the Market Place.—Mr. White appeared for the defence.—P.C. Burton deposed that on Saturday the 13th, at 8.45 p.m., he saw defendant hawking mackerel in High Street, and asked if he had a ticket. Defendant said he forgot to get one—and, to a boy standing by he said "Run down and get two tickets." About 6 minutes to 10 he asked if he had got those tickets, and he said "No; Mr. Buckett wasn't in." Told him he ought to have tickets the same as the other men.—Henry Buckett deposed that he was Market-keeper. On Saturday week defendant did not take a market-ticket. Was not from home that evening, but stood at the Town Hall doors from 7.30 to 10 10, the Hall being let. Anyone could have got a ticket from him—in fact he served some with tickets for fish at 8 30 —By Mr. White: The market gates were closed; the Act compelled him to close them at 8 p.m.—Mr. White, in addressing the Court, said he was induced to appear as the case was an extremely hard one on defendant, a very respectable young man, and a ratepayer of the borough. On the day in question a quantity of mackerel was sent him from Portsmouth, which, as a duty to himself, and a great benefit to the public, he immediately proceeded to sell, going to the top of High Street, where for many years fish had been sold on Saturday nights. The market was closed, and was he to allow the fish to perish? Under the old law there was always a very good exception, and selling mackerel on Sundays was allowed, the fish being perishable, and the sale being considered such a benefit, especially to the poor. He could not sell in the market, and whilst the Counsell allowed tickets for selling elsewhere to be issued, it appeared to him that the man had committed no offence. He had no ticket at the moment—didn't know the fish were coming. Even a ticket would not legalise the matter. The Corporation ought not to have moved in the matter. He remembered the Council resolving that there should be no proceedings taken in the case of fish hawking.—The Mayor: No corporation, or any body of men, have power to alter an Act of Parliament—can't make bye-laws which contravene the Act.—Mr. White: But they would act wisely if they didn't strain the law too much in matters of this sort.—The Mayor said that other persons with mackerel went and paid a penny, as defendant should have done. The object of having the penny tickets taken out was for the protection of the public—so that no improper persons, or improper food should be taken round the town. Defendant knew he was doing what was illegal, having had tickets before.—Fined 1s. and costs.

OBSTRUCTING PASSENGERS BY SELLING THE SAID FISH

*Henry William Frampton* was further charged with unlawfully, to the obstruction of passengers, causing two barrows to stand in High Street longer than necessary for loading or unloading goods on the 13th.—Sergt. Hincks deposed that about 7.55 p.m. on Saturday, the 13th, he saw defendant with a barrel and barrow in High Street, opposite Mr. Keet's shop. Told him to go on farther, and not stand in one place so long. He said he should move on presently. About 8.15 he saw him at the same place, and again spoke to him. Instead of moving, he told another "chap" named Penfold to draw some trucks up alongside the barrow. There he remained till 9 o'clock, causing an obstruction. The barrow was close by the pavement, and people had to go off the pavement on the road to pass.—By Mr. White: Defendant didn't say the barrow was broken down. Didn't know that it was. 30 or 40 people were standing round.—Mr. White addressed the Court for the defence. Mr. Frampton informed him that his barrow was so laden that it broke down. The words of the Act were "longer than necessary for loading or unloading." Until defendant had sold out, he had not unladen them. As he was fined in the first case, he hoped a little mercy would be shown and no fine imposed in this. The obstruction was caused by the joy of the people—not by defendant.—The Mayor said that in this case they inflicted only a very slight fine, 6d. and costs, but they wished it to be a warning to defendant and others.

Differences in understanding between the old traditions and the law could also lead to a court appearance.

COUNTY PETTY SESSIONS.

Saturday.— Before Sir H. Percy Gordon, Bart, (chairman), J. Coape, Esq., Admiral Crazier, Lieut.-Colonel Atherley, C. Brett, Esq., Capt. Lowther, and Capt. Young.

*Charles Mursell*, fisherman and landlord of the Commercial Inn, Bembridge, was summoned for having his house open during prohibited hours.

Mr. F. Blake appeared for the defendant.

P.C. Early, stationed at Bembridge, deposed that he was passing defendant's house at 4 o'clock on the morning of Wednesday, the 7th inst., and, seeing the bar door open, he entered and found there Walter Mursell, defendant's cousin, and Edmund Bull. Bull was drinking from a pint cup of beer. Witness said to Bull, "You are early at your drops," and then remonstrated with defendant for keeping his house open. Defendant replied that they were going out mackerel fishing, and Bull was going out to help them.

Mr. Blake submitted that there was no showing that the house was open for the sale of beer. Defendant with his cousin and Bull, their assistant, were evidently going forth in pursuit of their lawful calling, and defendant gave Bull some beer. Clearly the Legislature never contemplated interference with men in such a case. He called defendant, who deposed that he had kept the house for seventeen years. An arrangement was made over night that they should rise very early, and the one who was up first should call the others. They were all together at his house for the purpose of starting when he drew a pint of fourpenny beer and set it before Bull, who was to go with the pony and cart. He did not sell the beer– he gave it. The bar door was left open a few minutes by accident at that early hour.

*Walter Mursell*, defendant's cousin, gave corroborative evidence.

The Chairman said the Bench believed defendant, and dismissed the complaint.

*William Cotton*, fisherman, Atherfield, was summoned for selling beer without a license on the 23rd June.— Mr A. S. Estcourt defended.— P.S. Foster deposed that on the day in question he went to Atherfield, and from a quarter to 7 to 10 p.m. watched defendant's cottage. At 7 o'clock a man entered the house, and after remaining ten minutes left. At 20 minutes to 8 another man drove up to the hedge by the side of the garden, and Mrs Cotton took him out something in a pint mug, which he drank, and at five minutes past eight went away. At 9 p.m. a second man entered the cottage, and at 10 o'clock witness, in company with two constables, went into the house. He saw the man present put a pint mug on the table containing beer, and in a second cup witness also found some beer. He read the warrant to Mrs Cotton as defendant was not at home. On searching in the kitchen he found two pint mugs, a quart pot, a funnel, and an 18-gallon cask containing beer (all produced). He subsequently measured the beer in the cask and found the quantity to be six quarts. — By Mr Estcourt: The man he saw in the house was Frank Cotton — P.C. Sharp corroborated. — Mr Estcourt submitted that there was no case to answer. — The Chairman said that, taking a common sense view of the case as it stood, there was no doubt in his mind that the beer was to be paid for.— Mr Estcourt said the matter could be easily explained. Defendant, who was part-owner of a mackerel net, was captain during the season of a gang of nine men, who worked together with another gang of men belonging to Sandown. Defendant acted as treasurer, and in accordance with the usual custom a barrel of beer wa« provided out of the funds. When settling day arrived the beer was not all consumed, and since that time when any of the men required a glass of beer they were at liberty to go to defendant's house and get one.— Defendant and Southgate (captain of the Sandown gang) confirmed this statement.— The Bench dismissed the case.— Mr. Estcourt asked that the police might return the cask and mugs from whence they took them.— The Chairman, whilst stating that the Bench could make no such order, said that in dismissing the case they did not mean to convey that the police ought not to have taken any action in the matter.

## And Alongside a Little Bit of Smuggling...

Perhaps not surprisingly, reports of the mackerel season occasionally appeared alongside reports of another popular inshore activity around the back of the Wight: *smuggling*.

```{admonition} Isle of Wight - Monday 12 June 1826
:class: dropdown

Abundance of mackerel have been caught this week, at the back of the Wight of extraordinary good quality, and has been sold here at 3d. per doz.

Ninety tubs of smuggled liquor were deposited in the Custom House, at Cowes, this week, taken with four smugglers, at Bembridge.

At the Petty Sessions on Saturday last, *J. Gough* was brought before the magistrates, on a charge of having a pint of foreign Geneva concealed in his hat. The excise officer having met the prisoner on the Cowes road, asked to see what he had in his hat, which he refused to shew him, when a scuffle ensued, the hat fell off, and a bladder containing a pint of Geneva was taken from it. The Court found him guilty, and sentenced him to pay 100*l.* and in default of which he was conveyed, on Monday to Winchester.

Immense shoals of mackerel have arrived off the back of the Island, affording a rich harvest to the fishermen, as great quantities have been sold in this town at 3d. each.

Capture of a Smuggler

At half-past 2 on Friday morning Mr. Taylor, R.N., chief officer charge the Coastguard station, received intelligence that a sailing boat was landing a number of casks in Steel Bay, about two miles east of Ventnor, and close to Luccombe Chine. Mr. Taylor instantly called a boat's crew, and had a four-oared galley launched from Ventnor Bay, in order to pull round Dunnose point and, if possible, to cut off the supposed smuggler. 25 minutes from the intelligence being reported at Ventnor station the Coastguard boat reached the spot where tubs had been landed. The smuggler had taken his departure on the first alarm, and was now seen about four miles from the shore, standing off into the Channel with fair breeze. It seemed doubtful whether the Coastguard boat could overtake him, but she immediately made off in full pursuit, the men bending to their oars in fine style. After a very long pull, and a deal of dodging on the part of the pursued, the boat was captured a good distance out in the Channel, as far as the eye could reach from the cliffs. There was only one man, Noah Williams, of Ventnor, in the boat, but he was made prisoner, and brought back to Ventnor, about 10 o'clock, in his own boat, by two of the Coastguard men. Some other men, who had not been able to regain their boat on being surprised when landing their liquids in Steel Bay, had made good their escape by climbing the cliff.

COUNTY PETTY SESSIONS.

Saturday.Before Sir Henry Percy Gordon, bart., (chairman), W. G. Shedden, esq., C. Brett, esq., and C. G. M. Skinner, esq.

ALLEGED CHARGE OF SMUGGLING.

*Noah Williams*, of Ventnor, was brought up to answer a charge of landing 25 tubs of contraband spirits at Luccombe ion Wednesday, the 25th inst.

Mr. William Vaughan, acting collector of H.M. Customs, appeared on behalf of the Crown, and asked for a remand, to enable him to communicate with the Hon. Commissioners of Customs. The accused was remanded to this day Saturday.

ALLEGED CHARGE OF STEALING MACKEREL.

*Richard Norton*, wheelwright, and *John Rashley*, brickmaker, were charged with stealing four mackerel, the property Mr. George Lale, Wroxall, builder.

Mr. W. J. Beckingsale appeared on behalf the defendants.

Complainant said: I was at Wroxall on the 16th of May, and bought four mackerel. I was passing by the Star inn with the fish hanging by a string from one finger. I stopped to look at an entire horse the road, and several other persons were standing by and looking at the horse. Then Norton came out a yard and was looking on, and I, holding up the fish, made a remark about their being fine; and Norton, putting forth his hand, hooked the string of fish from mv finger and went away with them up the yard. I offered no resistance at that time, but felt annoyed when he and Rashley went away with them, and I said "This will not do; I charge you with stealing these mackerel." He did not reply to me, and in a short time came back to me with three of the fish on the string. I said: "Bring back the four, or I shall go to the police at Ventnor." Young and Farmer Dunford were with me at the time. Rashley then said to me "Look here, I will pay you for the fish;" and then he went on. I refused to take the three fish, as I wanted the four.

The defence was that taking away the fish was a mere practical joke, and there was no felonious intent. A person up the yard snatched a fish from the string, or the four would have been handed to complainant.

William Young, of Span Lodge, Wroxall, gave evidence which went to show that there was no appearance of a felonious intent. The Bench dismissed the complaint.

VENTNOR.

Capture of a Smuggler.— At half-past 2 on Friday morning Mr. Taylor, R.N., chief officer in charge of the Coastguard station, received intelligence that sailing boat was landing a number of casks in Steel Bay, about two miles east of Ventnor, and close to Luccombe Chine. Mr. Taylor instantly called a boat's crew, and had a four-oared galley launched from Ventnor Bay, in order to pull round Dunnose point and, if possible, to cut off the supposed smuggler. In 25 minutes from the intelligence being reported at Ventnor station the Coastguard boat reached the spot where tubs had been landed. The smuggler had taken his departure on the first alarm, and was now seen about four miles from the shore, standing off into the Channel with a fair breeze. It seemed doubtful whether the Coastguard boat could overtake him, but she immediately made off in full pursuit, the men bending to their oars in fine style. After a very long pull, and a deal of dodging on the part of the pursued, the boat was captured a good distance out in the Channel, as far as the eye could reach from the cliffs. There was only one man, Noah Williams, of Ventnor, in the boat, but he was made prisoner, and brought back to Ventnor, about 10 o'clock, in his own boat, by two of the Coastguard men. Some other men, who had not been able to regain their boat being surprised when landing their liquids in Steel Bay, had made good their escape by climbing the cliff.

BLACKGANG.

Smuggling.— The Coastguards captured 43 tubs of spirits at Atherfield, on Wednesday, supposed to have been sunk to wait an opportunity of landing. The rough sea washed them into shallow water, and the Coastguards with some difficulty got on shore.

Last week it afforded us pleasure to mention the success of the fishermen here catching large numbers mackerel, but we are sorry to have to record this week the serious loss sustained by many of them. No less than five boats were entirely lost on Tuesday night, by the tide rising to an unusual height. On Tuesday evening the boats all along the coast were pulled to what was considered a safe distance from the water, but in the night the wind rose very considerably, and with it the tide; boats were washed away to sea, and have not been heard of. One was entirely smashed, and two partially so. One of the latter belongs to Bembridge, and had come to Blackgang in hopes of sharing the success of the season with the Chale boats. We understand they had only caught about 100 fish when this accident happened. We are informed that the boats are not the most serious part of the loss, as there are four nets more or less seriously damaged! the cost of a good mackerel net being from £50 to £60.
