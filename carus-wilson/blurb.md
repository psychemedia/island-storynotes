What connects a pamphlet against the excesses of 1850s Newport entitled "Tempters and Tempted", a libel case brought by a former mayor of Newport, and Jane Eyre?

Following a chance encounter with a letter to Newport's magistrates encouraging a "stricter supervision over lodginghouses, lest they [...] prove nurseries of vice" (Isle of Wight Observer, Saturday, October 6th, 1855) local storyteller Tony "Monty" Hirst has pieced together a tale of Victorian Newport that receives its first telling at Babushka Bookshop, Shanklin, next Thursday (May 9th) at 7pm.

Also featuring a legend of Godshsill, a macabre tale from Arreton, and a children's tale  originally set in Shanklin that is still told today, "An Isle of Wight Miscellany" provides a great introduction to traditional storytelling "for grown-ups" from a popular island storyteller.

Local performance storyteller Tony "Monty" Hirst has been listening to stories for 25 years and telling them weekly to adults for 3. Starting with regularly slots at folk nights and open mics, joining the Isle of Wight based 'Tis Tales storytelling troupe in 2022, presenting several sold out solo shows throughout 2023, and forming "Stories'n'Harp" in early 2024, a collaboration with Ryde-based harpist Theresa Ellis and folk-singer Jenni Charity. With two shows under the belt already, Stories'n'Harp have several future performances already lined up, at Ventnor Fringe in July, Monkton Arts in November, and Medina Bookshop in December. In terms of solo shows, Monty is looking forward to a summer of storytelling on the Island as well as at mainland festivals and folk clubs.

In 2023, Monty was part of the Island Storytellers team who successfully bid for and received an £18,000 Arts Council and National Lottery funded grant to support "Somewhen Storytelling" (https://somewhen.org.uk/), a year long initiative running May 2023-April 2024 to develop storytelling practice and audiences on the Isle of Wight. The core Somewhen Storytelling team are keen to secure further funding and continue the project through 2024 and beyond.
