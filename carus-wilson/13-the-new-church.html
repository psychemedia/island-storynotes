<p>By 1848, the old Church in the centre of Newport, St. Thomas’, was in a considerable state of disrepair. So much so, in fact, that a special vestry meeting was called to propose that the church was passed being repaired, and needed to be rebuilt.</p>

Had they not allowed it to go on—if not into decay—without improvement, or caring for its welfare? and so long as they suffered things to go on in that careless manner, he feared that the blessing of God would never be shed over their doings or over their town.</p>

SEWELL, Esq., rose and said that he had been requested to bring the subject of the meeting before the Vestry, to state the particular purpose for which the meeting had been called, and he did it with peculiar pleasure, seeing such a number of the requisitionists present with him at the meeting. He (Mr. S.) would not detain them by any lengthened observations; but in order that they might understand their position, he would bring to their minds the remembrance of a vestry which was held about a twelvemonth since. That vestry was called to consider the best means of placing the Church in efficient repair, and a Committee was appointed for the purpose of obtaining a proper survey of the Church, by virtue of the first resolution, which was to the effect that the state of the Church was such as to call for immediate restoration and improvement. The Committee proceeded to obtain surveys and procure plans for its restoration, to be submitted to a future vestry. In the mean time it was wished to ascertain what sums of money could be procured for the purpose of putting it in a proper state of restoration, within a certain period of years. Anxious to obtain an opinion, however, as to the real stability of the fabric—an able, complete, and disintereeted opinion, and not open to attacks or observations—application was made in the first place to Mr. Cubitt; he was not, however, able to give a perfectly satisfactory opinion, as he was not able to give his personal attention to the subject. The Committee then appealed to Mr. Hardwicke, a surveyor of exceeding eminence in London, and one of the first of the profession. He had, with his son, surveyed the Church, and had given a written opinion—the opinion which led to the calling of the present vestry. The report, which was of considerable length, stated that the building, which was erected in the thirteenth century, had undergone considerable alterations at the commencement of the eighteenth century; that they had examined the walls, and found them decayed and dilapidated to some considerable extent; the naves, piers, and arches in very bad condition; that the whole structure had suffered much from badly considered alterations; that the seats were badly arranged, the roofs sunk, and in bad condition; that the timbers, however, were not unsound excepting the beams; that the tower was solid and substantial, provided the decaying stones were replaced by sounder material, but that the parapet and pinnacles were dangerous and unsound, and where not already removed ought to be so at once; that the edifice altogether was not actually dangerous to the congregation, but that it was in that state of decay that they could not advise any sum to be laid out upon it, in an attempt to repair it, for in that case it would be difficult to know where to stop, but in the event of the church being rebuilt, it would not be necessary to pull down the tower, but only to restore it. The Committee, on receiving this report, felt themselves unauthorised in taking farther proceedings until they had caused a vestry to be summoned to consider their position. This vestry was held in August last year, and the gentlemen then present, feeling that the matter should not and ought not rest there, and with the opinion of Mr. Hardwicke also before them, feeling that it was not right for the church to remain in that position until the danger did arise, they considered it best to start some plan for the purpose of considering the best mode of proceeding with the ulterior object of rebuilding the church. Conferences on this subject had been had with the Archdeacon and with the Bishop of the Diocese, on the right course of proceeding, and it was with the sanction of these great and competent authorities that he now came before the vestry to ask them to sanction those views and enable the Committee to carry out the objects they originally proposed —namely: To raise a fund by degrees, and by gradual accumulations and donations and subscriptions, for the purpose of pulling down the present edifice entirely, and building a new church. In order to do that rightly to the parishioners and right for the house of God, this building should not be inefficiently erected, but rebuilt in such a way as should make it stand for centuries, as the present edifice had done. They could say five years for subscriptions to accumulate, and not consent to the rebuilding unless a sufficient amount had been subscribed to enable them to go on with safety for that purpose. He now came before the Vestry for their sanction to these objects, that if a sufficient sums of money could be raised the parish would sanction their proceeding. If the vestry would that day sanction the rebuilding as soon as a sufficient sum could be raised, parties could then be placed in proper position for asking for the means of doing it, and the first object to be ascertained was the amount of costs, and then the amount to be collected sufficient to cover them. Mr. Hardwicke had stated that six thousand pounds would be sufficient; but they all knew the variations in estimates, and the after-calls that were frequently made upon them. Feeling that whatever was to be done should be substantially done, and what such a building demanded —feeling that a small sum uf money would be of no purpose whatever, and that any sum could be obtained if parties would exert themselves zealously to obtain it——he thought eight thousand pounds not too much to expend upon such a building, as he should feel sorry to see a single farthing expended, unless done substantially; and they had most of them seen of late years the very inefficient manner in which some churches had been erected. It was the duty of the churchwardens to see that no act of desecration was committed, until a satisfactory statement of the funds in hand to complete it had been furnished them, in order to discharge them from all responsibility in the matter; and he (Mr. S.) wished it to be distinctly understood that they ought not to consent to anything being done slightly or temporarily, or not even to be done at all, until they saw their way clearly through the matter. It was a most important question, and connected with the best interests of the town, and should be therefore considered most properly. If the vestry would now sanction the proposition to rebuild the church when sufficient funds be obtained for that purpose, they would at once give sufficient power to its well wishers to proceed at once to obtain that sum, and which he was sure would he obtained under their sanction. He felt assured that success would attend their efforts, if they set zealously and regularly and determinedly forward to obtain it, and it ought to be entered into under a deep sense of the nature of the work itself, and the purpose for which it was required, and for what purpose the money was to be appropriated. When once the subject was started, they would find many persons anxious to devote their pounds, nay, their hundreds of pounds, to the service of Almighty God; even that very day he would bring to their notice the consecration of the church of St. Augustine, in the county of Kent, where one individual contributed of his own means the sum of sixty thousand pounds towards its erection. Feeling it right that it should be done, and knowing that all could do something —feeling that if they gave to the extent of their means, not so much either as to the amount, but with a right spirit—he felt sure that their object would be obtained. There was a kind of feeling of depression over the town of Newport, which he feared had been created by their neglect of the house of God. Had they not allowed it to go on—if not into decay—without improvement, or caring for its welfare? and so long as they suffered things to go on in that careless manner, he feared that the blessing of God would never be shed over their doings or over their town. He trusted they would endeavour all in their power to raise sufficient sums to them to build a church sufficient for the town, and efficient in every respect for the service of the Almighty. Mr. Sewell concluded his very able and eloquent address by proposing that the Vestry should sanction the re-building of the church as soon as the necessary means should be provided.</p>
<p>Seconded by Mr. BENJAMIN Mew.</p>
</div>
<p>Having has to plan to rebuild the Church proposed and seconded, it was then time for the dissenters to speak, with a desire to clarify whether or not church-rates would be levied in association with the rebuilding costs.</p>

<p class="admonition-title">A Dissenter wished to have a distinct understanding</p>
<p>Mr. SAYER, as a Dissenter, wished to have a distinct understanding, that if the present church was pulled down the new one was to be built by the voluntary principle, and that parties were not afterwards to be called upon for a church-rate to pay for any particular portion of it.</p>
<p>Mr. BRYANT: The resolution says—” As soon as the necessary funds have been provided.”</p>
<p>Mr. SAYER: A distinct understanding is all I want on the subject.</p>
<p>Mr. P. SCOTT: It is in the power of the parish to refuse its assent to the pulling down until the necessary funds are raised.</p>
<p>Mr. SEWELL: I hope Mr. Sayer does not advert to any church-rate in perspective which may attach itself to this church, because, if so, I cannot undertake to answer his question</p>
<p>Mr. SAYER: I only allude to the building.</p>
<p>Mr. SEWELL: I only ask the parish to assent to the pulling down and re-building, when they shall be completely satisfied that there are funds in hand sufficient for the purpose, and there shall be nothing done without the sanction of all the authorities, nor do we intend to call on the parish for a rate for that purpose.</p>
<p>Mr. SAYER expressed himself perfectly satisfied.</p>
<p>Mr. NICHOLSON enquired if the right of the parishioners to their different sittings would be reserved to them as at present.</p>
<p>Mr. SEWELL Certainly.</p>
<p>There being neither amendment nor opposition offered the proposition, the CHAIRMAN put tbs question to the meeting, and it was carried unanimously, not a single hand being held up against it in a crowded vestry.</p>
<p>Mr. B. Mew expressed himself highly gratified with the novel unanimity of the meeting, and proposed a vote of thanks to the Senior Warden. Mr. Pring, for his kindness.</p>
<p>Mr. PRING acknowledged the compliment, and wished “he might live to see the new church finished.”</p>

<p>At the Borough Petty Sessions, before the Mayor and Mr. Abraham Clarke, Esq.,—Eliza Lacount, Fanny Castles, Mary Tayler, Ann Gladdis, Emma Kimber, and Caroline Kimber, who had been locked up fron the Saturday evening, and others from Sunday, were complained against by Mr. George Grapes, inspector of police, as conmon prostitutes, and having been found in the streets late at night. The mayor said the magistrates were determined to put down such open and gross vice and immorality. It was enough to call down the judgment of the Almighty, if not attempted to be checked. The court would not deal severely in the present instance, but it was intended as a warning to others and to themselves, if brought again before the court. As the defendants had been locked up a considerable time they would be discharged, with the exception of Emma Kimber, who was intoxicated and fined 5s., and 2s. 6d. costs, or one week’s imprisonment.</p>
<p>Abraham Racket, charged by the inspector of police with being drunk the night before, between eleven and the twelve o’clock ;—he was so almost every night.— Fined 5s. with a notice from the mayor that unless the fine was paid he would be placed in the stocks.</p>

<p>A couple of months later, the Mayor noted that he “had given instructions to the police to endeavour to check the nuisance and wickedness” and started upping the severity of punishments for particular forms of disorderly behaviour from a particular class of person.</p>

<p>Borough Court.— On Monday, before the Major and other magistrates.</p>
<p>A DISORDERLY CHARACTER.</p>
<p>Mary Ann Downer, a very young woman, was charged by Police Constable Cooke with making a great noise, in company with several young men, near the White Hart Inn, Pyie-street.</p>
<p>The Policeman stated that he ordered her off, but afterwards found her there, with men, at two o’clock; desired her again to go home; they were all making a great noise; she would not go, and he took her to the station-house; had often seen her out late at night. but never knew her noisy before, and when sober she is always quiet. Whilst the girls were out he could never get the men away.</p>
<p>Mr. Grapes, Inspector of Police, in answer to the court, said the prisoner was a common prostitute.</p>
<p>The Mayor observed that he had given instructions to the police to endeavour to check the nuisance and wickedness of such proceedings, and he hoped the sentence he was about to pronounce would be a lesson to her and others. Such courses end in the destruction of both body and soul, and he hoped the punishment would lead her to reflect on the dreadful life she was pursuing.</p>
<p>Fined 10s and Ss costs, which not being paid, she was committed to the House of Correction for fourteen days.</p>

<p>James Arthur, and William Henry Stubbs, two of the newly-appointed borough policemen, were charged by the Inspector with being drunk on the previous Saturday evening, while on duty. Witness deposed that on the day in question Arthur was on duty, and he desired him and Stubbs to be at the station-house at four o’clock. Stubbs was not wanted, but he told him to be at the station at six o’clock, for evening duty. Neither of them came until twenty-five minutes after six. Witness complained of their want of punctuality, and ordered them to be more correct in their time. He thought Stubbs appeared the worse for liquor. About half an hour after, Arthur came to the station-house quite drunk, he took off his coat, and said he did not wish to remain in the police. He saw several persons round Stubbs, who were jeering him, but he was not so drunk as Arthur. Witness sent them home, as unfit for duty.</p>
<p>The defendants did not deny the charge, but pleaded that they were sleepy, having been up the previous night, and had neglected taking proper food, wnich caused a little drink to have more effect.</p>
<p>The Mayor said he was sorry to see them so soon in such a position. The court had not for a long time heard of drunkenness amongst policemen. It was one of those offences that could not be overlooked, ss it was their duty to bring others to be punished for the offence they had been guilty of. The judgment of the court was, that both defendants be dismissed from the borough police.</p>

<p>A Sermon, in aid of the funds for rebuilding St. Thomas’ Church, Newport, was preached in the parish church of Bonchurch on Sundav last by the Rev. G. H. Connor, curate of Newport. The eloquent gentleman selected his text from Zechariah vi. 13, “Even He shall build the temple of the Lord; and He shall bear the glory, and shall sit and rule upon His throne.” At the close of the service, a collection made at the doors realised £11 5s.</p>

<p>Closing of St. Thomas’s Church.—</p>
<p>It is now positively arranged that next Sunday will be the last for holding Divine worship in our ancient parish church. Our feelings are indeed of a mingled character as we approach the solemn day. We cannot but hail with pleasure the prospect of having a new church in every way suited to the wants of the people. But it is impossible to contemplate the removal of the old fabric without many regrets. Built in the early part of the twelfth century. it has outlived many changes in our little town, and it will be long ere the eye is accustomed to the absence of one that has been the friend of many generations. On Sunday morning, the Mayor, Clergy, Magistrates, Councillors, and other officers of the Corporation, walk in procession to the church, when a sermon will be preached by the minister of St. Thomas, and a collection made in aid of the rebuilding fund. Sermons will be preached also and collections made after each of the other services. The Holy Communion will be administered in the evening, as the last solemn act of worship in the ancient fabric. Doubtless the scene will be an impressive and imposing one, and for years to come the closing day of the old parish church of Newport will be remembered as a memorable occasion in the recollection of the families of the Isle of Wight.</p>

<p>PRINCE ALBERT’S VISIT TO LAY THE FOUNDATION STONE.</p>
<p>The Chairman observed that as her Majesty’s Royal Consort had most graciously condescended to visit their ancient town at the end of the month, for the purpose of laying the foundation stone of their new church, he thought it was proper that he should be received by the officials of the town in a becoming manner. He therefore begged to invite the Corporation to meet him on the auspicious occasion; and other arrangements were being made, with the view of giving the Prince a suitable reception.</p>
<p>Mr. Pinnock. hoped that if any of the Council were absent on that day, it would not be construed into a want of loyalty for their Prince. Some of their body objected to processions, and wearing gowns; and he and others dissented from the doctrines of the Church of England. Therefore they could scarcely be expected to assist in laying the foundation atone of a church which denounces them some thirteen times a year.</p>

<p>NEWPORT, Saturday, August 12.</p>
<p>The Old Church is fast disappearing, and workmen are clearing the north-eastern side, for the purpose of arranging for the laying the foundation-stone— (see advertisement). We believe room will be allotted for nearly 2000 spectators, and everything is being done to render the anxiously looked-for day one of the most auspicious our town has ever witnessed. We can conscientiously say that there is but one feeling amongst all classes, that of unmixed desire to give the Prince a reception worthy of his high position and his exalted character. The banquet to be given by the committee will be on a scale of excellence and elegance; answers to the invitations have been nearly all received, and we have no doubt that this part of the matter will pass off with credit to all parties. We would recommend our friends to secure tickets as soon as possible, as there is even now a great demand for them. We have been given to understand that it is the gracious intention of her Majesty to erect a monument to the Princess Elizabeth, daughter of the unfortunate Charles I. Nothing can be more graceful than this act of our beloved Sovereign. There is a sympathy in it for the fate of one of royal blood, and another evidence of her Majesty’s good wishes for our church and town. We gave some information respecting this unfortunate Princess a few weeks ago. The vault in which her remains lay was discovered in 1793, near the altar, when the church was undergoing some repairs; a stone with the initials “E. S.” simply marking the spot. On the coffin appeared the following inscription :—</p>
<p>ELIZABETH 2ND DAUGHTER OF THE LATE KING CHARLES. DECE’D SEPT. 8. MDCL.</p>
<p>In order to more particularly mark the spot, the Church-wardens removed an old copper plate from the churchyard wall, which had been placed there in 1707, to the memory of a respected minister of their parish named Shergold, on the back of which they caused to be engraved the inscription to the illustrious Princess Elizabeth, which has already appeared in this paper, and was laid into a stone immediately in front of the altar. On removing this plate, within the last few days, the following quaint inscription to the clergyman was found at the back :—</p>
<p>HERE LYETH YE BODY OF MASTER GEORGE SHERGOLD LATE MINISTER OF NEWPORT WHO DURING SIXTEEN YEARS IN DISCHARGE OF HIS OFFICE STRICTLY OBSERVED YE TRUE DISCIPLINE OF YE CHURCH OF ENGLAND DISLIKING THAT DEAD BODIES SHOULD BE BURIED IN GODS HOUSE APPOINTED TO BE INTERRED IN THIS PLACE HE DYED UNIVERSALLY LAMENTED AND ESTEEMED JANUARY XXIII 1707.</p>
<p>From a MS. in the British Museum, entitled “Church Motes in the Isle of Wight,” and bearing the date of March, 1719, we learn that this tablet was on the churchyard wall, and as it conveyed a rebuke on the practice which very generally prevailed at the close of the last century, of burying within the church, it was probably selected to supply the material for the inscription over the resting place of the Princess, when accidently opened in 1793.</p>
</div>
<p>The weather was not so good the evening before. The wind was blowing a hurricane, and there were regular showers. Earlier that previous day, the magistrates had overseen the Annual Licensing Day, where several new licenses were granted, licensees were reminded that “public houses are not to be kept open from ten to six on Sundays, Christmas-day, Good Friday, public fasts, and thanksgivings”, and “George Machett, of the Blue Ball, was cautioned as to his house being frequented by prostitutes”.</p>

<p>THE HAMPSHIRE AND SOUTHAMPTON COUNTY PAPER.—SATURDAY, AUGUST 26, 1854.</p>
<p>NEWPORT. —Prince Albert, Thursday, laid the foundation of St. Thomas’s Church, in this town, in the presence of Lord Heytesbury, Governor of the island, the Bishop of the diocese, the county and borough members, the nobility and gentry, and Town Council. A committee had previously been formed to make arrangements for giving the Prince a suitable reception, and immense triumphal arches, dags, garlands of dowers, and similar complimentary devices, were prepared. The day was set apart as a complete holiday, and nearly all business was suspended. The 77th Regt. under the command of Colonel White, formed the guard of honour. His Royal Highness arrived at about one o’clock. On alighting from his carriage at the door of the Town-hall he was received by the Mayor of Newport, in his robes of office, the Bishop of Winchester, and other officials, and thence proceeded to the ante-room, where the drawings and plans of the new church were submitted to his inspection. After few minutes spent in conversation, a procession was formed towards the site of the church, on arriving at which, all having taken their places, the architect presented to his Royal Highness the working plans of the church, and explained its proposed accommodation, after which the customary coins and documents were placed in a cavity beneath the stone. The foundation stone was then partly lowered, and silver trowel, bearing the arras of the borough of New port, was presented to Prince Albert, who, having spread the mortar, said, “We place this stone in faith and hope to the glory of God, through Jesus Christ, our Lord.”</p>
<p>The stone having been adjusted, and the Bishop of Winchester having offered up prayer for the Divine blessing, the Grand Master of the Masonic Lodge of the Province poured upon the stone measures of corn, wine, and oil, and an appropriate hymn having been sung, the formal business was concluded. The stone bore the following inscription on a brass plate :—</p>
<p>“On Thursday, August 24. A.D. 1854, this foundation stone was laid his Royal Highness Prince Albert. Francis Pittis, mayor; G. H. Cooke, minister; Edw. Way and Henry Loose, churchwardens.”</p>
<p>The Bishop of Winchester then said,—Your Royal Highness, on behalf of the Mayor and Town Council of the ancient borough of this island, and of the assembled multitude of inhabitants whom your Royal Highness can see around you, I beg to return their respectful and gratelul acknowledgments for your great condescension in coming amongst us on this interesting occasion. It would be out of place for me to make any lengthened observations, but the inhabitants would have indeed gone away with sad hearts if they were not allowed an opportunity of thus expressing the feelings they entertain towards your Royal Highness. It is the greatest comfort to us to be enabled to do so, not only in the name of the clergy and people of this island, but in that of the people of Great Britain, who, as I have said, consider it a subject of great comfort in seeing in their beloved Sovereign and Royal Consort, a desire to dignify their position by doing everything that is valuable our country, and in themselves setting a bright example of all that can ennoble the people. As one of the clergy of this country, I beg to thank your Royal Highness for your attendance, which is more valuable than gold, as it shows the interest our Sovereign and your Royal Highness take in this event, and gives an additional proof of the feeling our Sovereign and yourself take in the welfare of this island.</p>
<p>His Royal Highness said, —My lord, I beg to express the great pleasure I have this day experienced in assisting you in the performance of this holy work, and I can bear testimony to the great interest the Queen takes in all matters of this kind in the nation at large, but in this Island in particular. I thank you for this honour.</p>
<p>His Royal Highness then left the ground, escorted by the principal authorities to the Town Hall, where he had few minutes conversation with the Mayor, and then reentered his carriage amidst similar hearty congratulations as had greeted his arrival. After the departure of the Prince, luncheon took place, the Mayor presiding, when various toasts were given, and the whole affair passed over in a very brilliant manner.</p>

<p>NEWPORT, Saturday, August 26.</p>
<p>GRAND CEREMONY OF LAYING THE FOUNDATION STONE OF THE NEW CHURCH OF SAINT THOMAS’S, NEWPORT, ISLE OF WIGHT.</p>
<p>As we anticipated in our last, the inhabitants of Newport witnessed on Thursday the grandest and most important day that had ever been known in the ancient borough. The preceding evening was remarkably unfavourable; the wind blew quite a hurricane, and copious showers seemed to portend anything but a propitious Thursday. Nevertheless, the weather-glass “looked up,” and hundreds awoke with thankful hearts on beholding a delightful sunny morning, which was rendered the more pleasant by the sprinkling over night.</p>
<p>The day was ushered in with a merry peal from the mellow bells of the old tower of St. Thomas, and the borough exhibited the appearance of a general holiday- the business of the town was almost entirely suspended, and flags and banners, with numerous devices, were to be seen pendant from the principal houses of the town. The approaches to the borough were variously decorated, and several beautiful arches, with appropriate devices, were erected in the principal thoroughfares. The “Albert Arch,” decorated with the Prince’s royal arms and other devices, was situated at the bottom of the High-street. The next arch was opposite the Town Hall, having the borough arms, and representing the Corporation of the borough of Newport. A third was in the Corn Market, and termed, “The Clerical Arch,” with the Right Rev. The Lord Bishop of Winchester’s arms; and a fourth, in the vicinity of the Bugle inn—a most splendid affair, called “the National Arch.” There were other devices in the upper part of the town, the Beast and Corn Markets, Node-hill, &amp;c. In every direction flags of every conceivable hue and colour met the eye, displayed from the most prominent situations, and scarcely a house of any size or importance but was profusely decorated with garlands of flowers bouquets, evergreens, and complimentary devices. In the main streets, garlands of flowers were suspended from side to side and the remains of the old church were also profusely decorated. Immense numbers of persons from all parts of the Island flocked in at an early hour, and, with bands of music and banners the whole scene presented a very grand and imposing effect.</p>
<p>At eleven o’clock, thousands of persons were assembled in the principal streets, and most of the shops immediately closed. Soon after, a guard of honour, consisting of about 200 troops of the Garrison, defiled in front of the Hall, and the Royal Marine Band struck up a pleasing strain.</p>
</div>
<p>The councillors met, the clergy met, the Masons met, and then they all convened at the Guildhall, with the rest of the procession assembling at Quay-street, to await the arrival of Prince Albert.</p>
<div class="dropdown admonition">
<p class="admonition-title">The dignitaries gather</p>
<p>The Members of the Town Council met at the residence of the Mayor, at half-past eleven o’clock, and accompanied him to the Town Hall.</p>
<p>The Bishop and about twenty of the Clergy assembled for the purpose of robing, at twelve o’clock, at the residence of the Rev. G H. Connor, and proceeded from thence in procession to the Town Hall.</p>
<p>The officers and brethren of the several Lodges assembled at the Masonic Hall at eleven o’clock, when a Grand Lodge of the province of the Isle of Wight was held, and a procession formed by twelve o’clock, which proceeded to the Guildhall, where the procession remained, to await the arrival of his Royal Highness Prince Albert.</p>
<p>Between twelve and one, the various bodies intended to form the procession were to be seen emerging from their different rendezvous, for the purpose of assembling in Quay-street.</p>
</div>
<p>The elaborate procession assembled, in order of rank, and made its way towards the Church, the Prince chatting as they went with the Bishop of Winchester and Francis Pittis, the Mayor.</p>
<div class="dropdown admonition">

<p>The whole mass now moved forward towards the church, the Prince conversing with the Worshipful the Mayor and the Bishop. When the procession arrived at the tower of St. Thomas’s Church, it halted, and divided right and left, for the Right Worshipful the Provincial Grand Master and the Provincial Grand Officers to pass up the centre, preceded by his banner and Sword Bearer, and followed by the remainder of the procession, until the whole had entered the enclosure around the stone.</p>
</div>
<p>Seating galleries surrounded the site where the foundation stone would be laid, the invited dignitaries arranged around it. Military bands continued to provide music as and when appropriate.</p>
<p>A rather elaborate ritual was then played out. Firstly, the stone was raised, Prince Albert was shown a copy of the plans, and “a bottle, containing the coins of the realm and parchment roll, were deposited in a cavity beneath the stone [and the] The foundation stone was then partly lowered”. An inscribed and elaborately decorated silver trowel was presented to Prince Albert, who used it to spread cement on the lower stone before “the upper stone was let down slowly, with solemn music”, and his Royal Highness made a dedication, before giving the stone three strokes with a mallet.</p>
<p>The Freemasons then performed their ritual. The senior masons proved the stone to be properly laid using plumbrule, level and square, and the Provincial Grand Master gave three knocks using a maul presented to him by the Architect, “at the same time invoking the blessing of the Grand Architect of the Universe”, whereup the brethren responded.— <em>So mote it be.</em>. The Provincial Grand Master gave the plan tools to the builder, before scattering corn and pouring wine and oil upon the stone. The Provincial Grand Chaplain closed that part of the ceremony with an appropriate prayer, in response to which the brethren again chanted <em>So mote it be</em>.</p>
<div class="dropdown admonition">
<p class="admonition-title">The ceremony proceeds</p>
<p>Spacious galleries had been erected, and these were filled by the fashionables of the Island, with a good sprinkling of military and naval uniforms. The stone was suspended by a pulley from supports decorated with evergreens. It was very large, and beautifully chiselled for the occasion. We understand it was the gift of Mr. Joseph Poore, of Newport. It bore the following inscription, engraved on a brass plate: —“On Thursday, August 24th, A.D., 1854, this foundation stone was laid by his Royal Highness the Prince Albert, Francis Pittis, Mayor; George Henry Connor, M.A. Minister; Edward Way, Henry Loosemore, Church-wardens.”</p>
<p>His Royal Highness, accompanied by the Mayor and Masonic officers, walked through the portal of the church tower, and the positions were taken up as follows :—</p>
<p>Town Clerk, Equerries. The Bishop’s Chaplain, James Eldridge, esq. Rev. E. M’All.<br />
The Mayor, F. Pittis, esq. His Royal Highness Prince Albert. The Lord Bishop of Winchester.<br />
The Mayor’s Chaplain, Rev. Mr. Wallis. THE STONE. The Rev. E. D. Scott, Vicar of Carisbrooke.<br />
Provincial Grand Master, T. W. Fleming, esq. The Rev. G. H. Connor.<br />
Deputy Provincial Grand Master. Architect, Mr Daukes. Minister of St. Thomas’s Church.<br />
Senior Warden, Mr. E. Way. Junior Warden, Mr. Loosemore. Builders, Messrs. T. and J. Dashwood, of Ryde.<br />
Surrounded by the Corporation and the whole Clergy of the Island. The choir and band were allotted a portion of one of the galleries.</p>
<p>His Royal Highness viewed the brilliant assembly with evident interest while the stone was being raised. The Bishop of Winchester then said aloud, “The glorious Majesty of the Lord our God be upon us! Prosper Thou the work of our hands upon us! O, prosper Thou our handy work.”</p>
<p>Psalm cxxxii., verses 3 to 16 inclusive, was then repeated alternately by the Bishop and Clergy and a large number of the spectators.</p>
<p>The architect of the building then presented to his Royal Highness the working plans of the church, and explained to him its proposed accommodation, after which a bottle, containing the coins of the realm and parchment roll, were deposited in a cavity beneath the stone. The foundation stone was then partly lowered, and a silver trowel presented to Prince Albert.</p>
<p>The trowel, provided by Mr. Dudley, silversmith, was of most chaste workmanship, and bore the following inscription :— “St Thomas’s church, Newport, Isle of Wight. The foundation stone laid by his Royal Highness Prince Albert, August 24tb, 1854. Francis Pittis, Mayor.” On the back were his Royal Highness’s arms, surrounded by the Order of the Garter, very elaborately executed.</p>
<p>His Royal Highness then spread the cement on the lower stone, the upper stone was let down slowly, with solemn music, and his Royal Highness said, “We place this stone in faith and hope to the glory of God, through Jesus Christ our Lord.”</p>
<p>The stone being adjusted, and his Royal Highness having given it three strokes with a mallet, the Provincial Grand Master approached the stone, and proved it to be properly laid by the plumbrule, presented by the J.G.W.; the level, presented by the S.G.W.; and the square, presented by the D.P.G.M.</p>
<p>The Architect then delivered the maul to the Provincial Grand Master, who gave three knocks, at the same time invoking the blessing of the Grand Architect of the Universe, and the brethren responded.— <em>So mote it be.</em></p>
<p>The Provincial Grand Master delivered the plan and tools to the builder, for his use, after which he scattered corn and poured wine and oil upon the stone.</p>
<p>The Provincial Grand Chaplain then gave the appropriate prayer, the brethren again responding— <em>So mote it be</em>, when the Provincial Grand Master announced to his Royal Highness and the Mayor that the stone was laid.</p>
</div>
<p>It was then the turn of the Bishop to Winchester to say the Church prayers.</p>
<div class="dropdown admonition">
<p class="admonition-title">The prayers begin</p>
<p>The Bishop of Winchester then audibly repeated the folowing prayers:—</p>
<p>“O, Almighty God, who hast built Thy Church upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the head corner-stone, grant us so to be joined together in unity of spirit by their doctrine, that we may be made an holy temple, acceptable unto Thee, through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.”</p>
<p>“O most glorious Lord God, we acknowledge that we are not worthy to offer unto Thee anything belonging to us; yet we beseech Thee, of Thine infinite goodness, graciously to accept and bless our intention of rebuilding in this place a house, which may be for ever dedicated to Thy honour and service. May the people bring forth the head-stone thereof with shoutings, crying ‘Grace, grace unto it!’ May the glory of this latter house be greater than the glory of the former. May faithful men be raised up from generation to generation, who within its walls may proclaim the glad tidings of salvation and the riches of Divine grace. May Thine holy days be here remembered —Thy sacraments duly administered and reverently received— the youth instructed— the aged reminded of their duty, and exhorted to persevere unto the end— and all builded up as living temples of the Holy Ghost, that Thou mayest bless us, and we may honour Thee, through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.”</p>
<p>The Lord’s Prayer followed, after which the following appropriate hymn was sung by a most effective choir, accompanied by selected instruments from the Royal Marine band, led by Mr. John Mew, the organist of St. Thomas’s church :—</p>
<p>This stone to thee in faith we lay;<br />
To thee this temple. Lord, we build;<br />
Thy power and goodness here display,<br />
And be it with thy presence fill’d.</p>
<p>Here, when thy people seek thy face,<br />
And dying sinners pray to live.
Hear thou in heaven, thy dwelling-place;<br />
And when thou nearest, Lord, forgive !</p>
<p>Thy glory never hence depart;<br />
Yet choose not, Lord, this house alone:<br />
Thy kingdom come to ev’ry heart;<br />
In ev’ry bosom fix thy throne !</p>
</div>
<p>With the benediction complete, the Bishop thanked the Prince Consort, who responded in turn, before departing.</p>
<p>The invited guests then repaired to the Town Hall to await the serving of lunch, with the Freemasons returning to their Grand Lodge to resume their business before a three o’clock at the Star Hotel.</p>
<div class="dropdown admonition">
<p class="admonition-title">Thanks are given, and the ceremony is completed</p>
<p>The benediction having been given, The Bishop of Winchester then said— Your Royal Highness, I tender to you, on behalf of the Mayor and Town Council of this ancient borough, of this island, and of the assembled multitude of inhabitants whom your Royal Highness can see around you, their respectful and grateful acknowledgments for your great condescension in coming amongst us on this interesting occasion. It will be out of place for me to make any lengthened observations; but the inhabitants would, indeed, have gone away with sad hearts if they were not allowed an opportunity of thus expressing the feelings they entertain towards your Royal Highness. It is the greatest of comforts to us to be enabled to do so; I speak not only in the name of the clergy and people of this island, but in that of the people of Great Britain, who, as I have said, consider it a subject of great comfort in seeing in their beloved Sovereign and in their beloved Sovereign’s Prince Consort those who not only evince so great a desire to dignify their position by doing everything that is valuable to the welfare of our country, but in themselves set a bright example of all that can ennoble the people. As one of the clergy of this country, I consider that your Royal Highness’s attendance this day is better than a thousand sermons. It shows that a hearty interest and sympathy are felt by our gracious Sovereign, and by your Royal Highness, in an event so interesting to the people of this town and to the people of this Island. We see in it an additional proof of the interest our gracious Sovereign and your Royal Highness take in the welfare of this Island.</p>
<p>His Royal Highness, who was evidently much gratified, said— My lord, allow me to express to you the feeling of gratification I have this day experienced in being amongst you and assisting you in the performance of this holy work, and in doing so I wish also to bear testimony to the great interest the Queen takes in all matters of this kind in the nation at large, and in the welfare of this Island in particular. I thank you for this honour —(loud cheers).</p>
<p>The ceremony being completed, the procession was again formed, and returned to the Town Hall, and on reaching the north door, it stopped, and fell back in double line, to allow his Royal Highness to pass through the entire procession, to the Town Hall. His Royal Highness had a few minutes conversation with the Mayor, and re-entered his carriage amidst hearty congratulation.</p>
<p>The guests afterwards retired to the arcade of the Town Hall, until luncheon was announced. The Masonic brethren repaired to their lodge-room, where the business of the Grand Lodge was resumed, and at three o’clock they dined at the Star Hotel.</p>
<p>The 77th Regiment, under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel White, formed the guard of honour on the occasion, the other line of procession being kept by detachments from the 20th and 28th Regiments.</p>
<p>The bands of the Royal Marines and the 4th Regiment performed “most eloquent music” during the day, as well as several local bands of the neighbourhood.</p>
</div>
<p>In a Town Hall profusely decorated with flowers and paintings of the new Church. The tables were resplendent with silver cups and dishes, “covered with every delicacy and the choicest wines”. The principal guests took their seats on a raised platform, the Mayor (Francis Pittis) and the Bishop of Winchester in pride of place, whereup the Mayor raised a toast to the Her most gracious majesty, the Queen, and the band fired up the National Anthem to great cheering.</p>

<p>The Town Hall was externally covered with evergreens and flowers, while internally the scene was of a magnificent character. At one end, appropriated to the principal guests, was a dais, over which was displayed the banner of Newport, and around the room were hung festoons of laurels and flowers, with devices in dahlias and other flowers. The tables were covered with every delicacy and the choicest wines, the banquet being provided by Messrs. Mew, of the Bugle inn. There were several beautiful paintings adorning the walls, with the designs for the new church, and the fine life-like full-length portrait of the late Sir Leonard Holmes. The tables were bedecked with several massive silver epergnes, cups, and dishes. The Mayor took the chair, supported on his right by the Bishop of Winchester and on the left by General Lord Downes, the Ven. Archdeacon Wigram, Colonel Rumley, Colonel Delacombe, T. W. Fleming, esq. The whole of the clergy of the Island, and amongst the general company were Lieutenant- Colonel Dwyer, Captain Symonds, Lieutenant and Adjutant Driver, Lieutenant Pearse, Lieutenant Taylor, Dr. Wilday, M.D. Commander Adams. Captain Daly, Captain Henries, Captain Scott, Lieutenant Wesley, Captain Gordon, R.M. Lieutenant Manners, Lieutenant Waterworth. Captain Crozier, R.N. Hon.

<p>Grace having been said by the Rev. Allen Wallace,<br />
the Mayor called upon the assembly to charge their glasses, and proposed the health of her most gracious Majesty the Queen. The toast had always been received with every demonstration of loyalty, and he felt assured all present would do honour to it— (great cheering, the band performing the National Anthem).</p>
</div>
<p>But for some, however, it seems they were not invited to the ball, as the rather bitter correspondent from the <em>Isle of Wight Observer</em> commented:</p>

<p class="admonition-title">A spirit of exclusiveness</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000170/18540826/006/0002">Isle of Wight Observer - Saturday 26 August 1854</a></p>
<p>[SIMILAR REPORT TO ELSEWHERE]</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>[NOTABLE GUESTS] [a]nd about 180 of the principal personages of the island filled the surrounding tables. We hear that this banquet off with éclat; but owing to the spirit of exclusiveness which the Committee was actuated in inviting only a portion of the press, we are sorry we cannot afford our patrons that full report which we usually do of such aristocratic gatherings; but have no doubt they, with us, will feel with us that such a petty and ridiculous distribution of their favours in no way redounds to their credit. It will have this effect that the most aristocratic portion of the Island visitors will be saved the trouble of wading through the after-dinner stereotype speeches used on such occasions.</p>
<p>Owing to the late hour the Freemason’s banquet came off the report is postponed till next week.</p>
<p>We cannot close our report without making mention of the scurvy treatment got at the hands of the managers of this pageant. With a partiality, as rare as it is contemptible, they invited <em>portion</em> of the Press only, albeit they were glad to accept of the gratuitous puffing of <em>all</em>. Let this not be understood as the language of complaint; but rather as showing another instance of the unscrupulous manner in which some will “grind their axe” upon others. We have, however, discharged our duty to the subscribers and patrons of the <em>Observer</em> in the best manner we possibly could under such unusual and grossly partial circumstances.</p>
</div>
<p>The Queen duly toasted, Mayor Pittis then raised a toast to “the illustrious Prince” and the other members of the royal family, followed by a toast to the health of the Lord Bishop of Winchester and his faithful clergy.</p>
<div class="dropdown admonition">
<p class="admonition-title">The Mayor’s toasts to the Prince and the Bishop</p>
<p>The Mayor said he now rose to propose the health of the illustrious Prince, who had that day honoured them with his presence on the occasion of laying the foundation stone of a building dedicated to Almighty God. His Royal Highness had conferred a lasting obligation upon the inhabitants of Newport, and had set a noble example to the junior members of the Royal family. He trusted all would join with him in the prayer that the blessing of God might descend upon the great work of the day; and he hoped that the building, the foundation of which they had so auspiciously laid, might rise in all its beautiful proportions, and that thousands yet unborn might worship beneath its portals— (cheers).</p>
<p>The Mayor proposed the health of his Royal Highness the Prince of Wales and the other members of the Royal family. This day would be an illuminated page in the history of the Island, and of the country, and the rich and poor, peasant and peer might look to the Throne for example. The Royal family were the nation’s hope; and his wish was that God might confer his blessing upon them, and that they might shine like gems around the diadem of our beloved Sovereign— (cheers).</p>
<p>The Mayor desired to propose the health of the Lord Bishop of Winchester and the clergy who had done them the honour to assemble on the occasion— (cheers). It would ill become him, in the presence of his lordship, to offer any laudatory remarks; but in these momentous times they, as laymen, must not forget the high privileges which they enjoyed. It was most consolatory to them to know that the clergy of the Island, when difficulties beset their path, applied with confidence to the Lord Bishop for advice and counsel— for the advice of one who bad always shown himself unwavering in the principles of our reformed religion— (cheers). He thanked the clergy for the assistance they had rendered and the honour they had done him on the occasion, and he was quite sure that those around him would respond to the toast with enthusiasm—(great cheering).</p>
</div>
<p>The Bishop of Winchester accepted the toast to him with thanks, and a game of propose-and-accept-the-toast began.</p>
<p>In passing the Mayor noted that:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>In the first place there was a strong feeling that the church should be renovated, but this being found impossible, they then set themselves to the work of erecting a new building, and they pledged themselves, collecting subscriptions from year to year, to commence the building within a period of five years. They had to fight a great battle to get together their funds, and had carried out their intention at the expiration of the fifth year of their labours and commended those responsible for “raising between £7000 and £8000” to support the cause.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>The “separation of Newport from the united parishes of Carisbrooke and Northwood” into its own parish was also announced to great cheers.</p>

<p class="admonition-title">The toast is responded to, and other toasts follow</p>
<p>The Lord Bishop of Winchester, addressing the assembly as Mr. Mayor, his lordship, and gentlemen, said he rose without a moment’s hesitation to offer on behalf of the clergy of the Island, and in his own name, their respectful acknowledgments for the honour which had just been paid to them. He might truly say that this day was one of unmixed gratification to him. He had looked forward, now through many years, to the day which should see the foundation-stone laid of that edifice, which he trusted would prove one of the best buildings of the town, in every sense of the term, and become a credit not only to that place but to the whole Island— (cheers). He looked to the church, which, under God’s blessing they hoped to raise within the town, not merely as an architectural building, although in that view he should not be the last to acknowledge its merits; but he looked to it as a spot where those who came after them, as well as themselves while they remained here on earth, might repair for consolation and instruction in righteousness— (hear, hear, and cheers). He considered that the auspices under which the church had been commenced that day should lead them to expect a happy termination of the work—(hear, hear). The introduction which the Mayor had given relative to the Royal family, had reminded him of the many obligations they owed to the Royal personage who had so condescendingly honoured them with his presence— (cheers). His Royal Highness Prince Albert had manifested a deep interest in all works for the advancement of art and science and in addition to the efforts made for the advancement of literature, science, and art in this country— to which such a response had been made— Royal Highness united in that which must be most dear to them, a deep feeling for the moral and religious welfare of the people of this country—(cheers). He saw in the presence of his Royal Highness that day that he took an interest in the spiritual welfare of our countrymen, and he recognised in a proof that their Royal neighbour, the Sovereign of this country, as well as her Royal Consort, were willing to be ranked, not only as the Sovereign of the country and the Royal Consort of the Sovereign but as neighbours to them— (great cheering). These were truly auspicious circumstances, and he might well call upon the Mayor in common with his fellow townsmen to rejoice and give God thanks for that which would long be remembered as a day of unmingled happiness amongst the townsmen of the Island— (cheers). He begged to return, on behalf of himself and on behalf of the clergy of the Island, their respectful thanks for the honour done them— (cheers).</p>
<p>The Mayor next proposed the Army and Navy. The sister services were fighting for our hearths and homes in a foreign land, and not only for our hearths and homes but for the hearths of those who were not sufficiently strong to act against the powerful aggressor— (cheers); and it would be seen that they would act with that daring and bravery which had ever distinguished the British soldier and sailor— (cheers). It was not only for the liberty of a foreign nation they were fighting, but for a nation at home, in order that we may live in that peace and prosperity which we had so long enjoyed. He would couple with the toast the names of his distinguished visitors, General Lord Downes for the Army and Captain Crazier for the Navy—(cheers).</p>
<p>Lord Downes, in the name of the Army in which he had the honour of serving, desired to return their thanks. The Army had almost been in a dormant state for some long time, but we might probably now hear of their success under the excellent management of Lord Raglan, and he trusted that the prayers of those who assembled within the church that day would be for the success of our gallant army—(cheers).</p>
<p>Captain Crozier, R.N. said, as the senior officer of the Navy present, he returned thanks for the manner the Mayor had proposed the toast and for the flattering reception it had met at their hands. He felt confident that wherever the servicea of the Navy, as well as of the sister service, might be called for, they would zealously and gallantly do their duty— (Cheers). He once more returned, on behalf of the service, his sincere and heartfelt thanks— (cheers).</p>
<p>The Lord Bishop of Winchester felt that he had already too long delayed in proposing a token of respect to the Mayor and Corporation of the town which they so well deserved. In assembling his friends around that table, the Mayor had conferred upon all of them a deep obligation, as he looked upon these opportunities of meeting each other with peculiar interest; it afforded him the opportunity of meeting those whom he could not at all times be amongst— not only the sister services of the country but those who were more closely allied with him, and who now all united together and took the opportunity of assembling round the social board in the interchange of kindly feeling and intercourse with each other— (cheers). He spoke the feelings of the clergy of the Island, and might he not hope those of the laity of the Island as well, and he would call upon all to join with him in drinking the health of the Mayor of the borough and of the Corporation of which he filled so worthily the chief office— (cheers).</p>
<p>The Mayor said it was certainly, and must be, a memorable day they had passed through, in the records of the borough. The Prince Albert had honoured them with his presence, as well as their lordships, the Lord Bishop of Winchester and Lord Downes; but they had witnessed a circumstance of far greater consequence —they had laid the foundation of an edifice to be erected for the service of the Almighty— (hear, hear), a building which would not only be useful to them, but for generations yet to come— (cheers). They had watched that dear and time-worn building— they had looked at it with feelings of the deepest veneration —in it their forefathers had offered up their praises and their prayers— and he and others could have wished it might be renovated and preserved; but on mature consideration they felt that the building had become in too dilapidated a condition, that age had worked its way, and after a lapse of time they had applied to the task of re-building the church. They never could forget the zealous efforts of one who could not be present with them but whose heart’s feelings were still with them, the Rev. Joseph Maude —(cheers). To his exertions they owed very much, and they regretted deeply his absence, but his place in their labours had bean zealously filled by the reverend gentleman who succeeded him. The Rev. G. H. Connor—(cheers); and through their united efforts they had found that, after removing their old building, they had raised sufficient to carry up the body of the church, and trusted that when that time arrived the Providence which had enabled them to raise between £7000 and £8000, would still smile upon them, that they might see the building carried out as it was shown upon their design, that they might see the tower as well as the body of the church erected— (cheers). The Lord Bishop of Winchester had kindly contributed, many gentlemen around the table had done the same, they had embarked in the work entrusted to them, and God grant they might have the strength and assistance to carry it out— (cheers). He saw many Aldermen and Councillors around who could speak for themselves; but for himself and on behalf of the Corporation, he returned most grateful thanks— (cheers).</p>
<p>Mr. Alderman Estcourt, after a pause, said as he had been waiting for the senior members of the Corporation to return thanks, he had hesitated to rise. He never, until that day, thoroughly appreciated the honour of belonging to the Corporation, by whose combined action had been gathered such an honourable assembly on that occasion. He returned thanks on behalf of himself and the other members of the Corporation— (cheers).</p>
<p>The Mayor said the next toast was one respecting which he felt some diffidence in approaching. It was the health of the Provincial Grand Master, who had left the room to join in the duties of his lodge, and the Masonic brethren—(cheers). Although these gentlemen kept many things in the dark, some would shine forth; they could see that the brethren visited the fatherless and the widow, relieved the distressed, and came forth in any work which had for its ends the benefit of mankind, and they might therefore conclude that their principles and motives sprung from the purest source— (cheers). He was honoured by their presence and thanked them for their attendance. He gave them the toast of the Masonic brethren, coupling it with the name of Brother Waterworth-(cbeers).</p>
<p>Mr. Waterworth acknowledged the toast, and said that although there were many good men in the town who were not Masons, there could not exist a Mason who was not a good man (hear, hear, and cheers). He concluded by returning thanks for the Masonic craft.</p>
<p>Mr. W. B. Mew also acknowledged the compliment.</p>
<p>The Mayor said with the next toast he had really arrived at the foundation. They looked around and thought of the men who had originated the work, and, with the exception of those who had been called to their fathers, had steadily persevered in it up to the present time, those gentlemen being the Church Building Committee— (cheers). In the first place there was a strong feeling that the church should be renovated, but this being found impossible, they then set themselves to the work of erecting a new building, and they pledged themselves, collecting subscriptions from year to year, to commence the building within a period of five years. They had to fight a great battle to get together their funds, and had carried out their intention at the expiration of the fifth year of their labours— (cheers). There was one gentleman whose exertions had been most strenuous, who had given them sound advice, and had been constant in his attendance on the committee: the Rural Dean was known throughout the length and breadth of the Island—(cheers), his kindness and condescension were proverbial, and they had much thank him for that the church was commenced that day He called upon them to drink the health of the Rev. E. M’All and the Church Building Committee —(cheers).</p>
<p>The Rev. E. M’All * could not express the gratitude he felt at the high consummation at which they had arrived that day, a consummation which would give to the town of Newport, and to the whole of the Isle of Wight, a church worth of its metropolis— (cheers).</p>
<p>The Mayor said the next health was that of the Rev. E. D. Scott, the Vicar of Carisbrooke, whose desire at all times was do that which would prove of advantage to them, and add to their general contentment here and happiness hereafter. The gentleman would make a most important announcement but before doing so they would have the gratification of drinking his health — (great cheering ).</p>
<p>The Rev. E. D. Scott returned thanks for the compliment, and added it would ill become him on a day like that to delay them but he would simply say that he would consent, with all his heart, to a separation of Newport from the Vicarage of Carisbrooke— (enthusiastic cheering).</p>
<p>The Rev. Bursar of Queen’s College, Oxford, said an application had been made to them that they should forward the separation of Newport from the united parishes of Carisbrooke and Northwood, and appropriate a portion of the great tithes toward its endowment, and that proposition they had unhesitatingly accepted— (loud cheers), and, acting upon the advice of the Lord Bishop of the diocese, they had resolved that means should be taken towards erecting Newport to a separate parish— (cheers).</p>
<p>The Mayor rose to propose the health of the Rev. Mr Connor, minister of St. Thomas’s, who came amongst them when bereft of a pastor whom they all knew and esteemed, had to put his shoulder to the wheel, and had to work hard in the good cause in which they were embarked— (cheers).</p>
<p>The Rev. Mr. Connor, in returning thanks, said his own poor efforts would fall very far short of success, were they not aided by his reverend brethren, especially the Rev. Arthur Pennington whom he must thank for his kindness and support in all matters connected with the parish— (cheers).</p>
<p>The Mayor then proposed the health of the Rev. Arthur Pennington.</p>
<p>The Rev. Mr. Pennington said his desire and endeavour was to labour with Mr. Connor in promoting the spiritual interests of the town, and so long as he was spared his endeavour should be to promote its spiritual and its everlasting welfare— (cheers).</p>
<p>The Mayor proposed the health of Colonel Delacombe, of the Royal Marines, with thanks for the use of the band.</p>
<p>Colonel Delacombe suitably responded to the toast.</p>
<p>Lord Downes gave the health of the Ladies who had worked for the bazaar.</p>
<p>Mr. E. Way proposed the health of the Rev. Bursar of Queen’s College, Oxford.</p>
<p>The Rev. Bursar, in acknowledging the compliment, said although the proposition made by Newport was received favourably by the College, it could not have been carried out for an indefinite time but for the Vicar, the Rev. Mr. Scott, who had very kindly and liberally brought the matter on to its present position, and thus enabled the College to carry out the wish of the inhabitants of Newport, with whom they very kindly sympathised —(loud cheers).</p>
<p>The Mayor proposed the Vice-Presidents, Messrs. Eldridge (Town Clerk), W. Way, and Jewell.</p>
<p>The Town Clerk acknowledged the toast.</p>
<p>Mr. J. Wyatt, of Oxford, responded to the toast of the Ladies.</p>
<p>The Mayor expressed his gratitude to the military authorities at Parkhurst for their co-operation at all times with the civic power, and gave the health of Colonel Rumley and the officers of Parkhurst Barracks— (cheers).</p>
<p>Colonel Rumley responded, after which the health of Captain Scott and the Isle of Wight Artillery Militia was given and responded to.</p>
<p>The Royal Marines band, which played an appropriate selection of music in the intervals between the toasts then performed the National Anthem, and the company separated.</p>
<p>It is worthy of remark that during the whole of the day’s ceremonies the large mass of people that crammed the town behaved with the utmost decorum, and no accident of any kind happened.</p>

<h2>What Next?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-next" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>With the foundation stone laid, the rebuilding of the physical fabric of the new church could now start in earnest. But what about rebuilding the spiritual heart of the Borough of Newport, and removing the cancer of vice and depravity that might corrupt it, or offend it with the regular and very public display of disorderly conduct that was rife in the streets around St. Thomas’s Square?</p>
