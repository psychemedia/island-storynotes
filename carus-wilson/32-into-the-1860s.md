BOROUGH PETTY SESSIONS. (Monday. Dec. 29.—Before Edward Way, and J. H. Hearn, Esqrs.)

Female Debauchery.

A woman named Elizabeth Jackman, a prostitute, was brought up in custody, charged with being drunk in the public streets at midnight, on the previous Friday. The case was proved by PC. Stubbs, who stated that on Friday night, about half-past 12 o'clock, he saw the defendant in Paradise-row, and also in Pyle-street, in a state of intoxication. He desired her to go to her home, which was situate in Paradise-row, but she requested that she might be locked up. He again repeated the salutary advice to go home, but, after walking down Pyle-street, she returned to the officer a second time, and in accordance with her request, locked her up in the station-house.

The girl expressed contrition for her conduct, and, after duly admonishing her, the bench ordered her to be discharged.

The following tale amusingly tells of how one visitor to the Tontine Tap had his lunch stolen.

BOROUGH PETTY SESSIONS. [Monday.— Before R. M. Wavell, and E. Scott, Esqrs.]

Felony.— Sarah Duffy, a woman of low character and depraved habits, was charged with stealing a piece of pork, of the value of two shillings and five pence, the property of William Lane, a labouring man residing at Arreton. It appears that the silly fellow had been drinking with the prisoner the "Tontine Tap" till midnight on Saturday last, and had with him a basket provisions for home, including a choice bit of pork for Sunday's dinner. When the tap was closed and they could get no more beer, he went with the fascinating Mistress Duffy—whose blandishments and charms he could not resist—to her house up the Tontine yard, and she had not much difficulty in persuading him to go back and try to get a pint of beer, and whilst he was gone she opened the lid of his basket, looked at the pork, approved both quantity and quality, and so took it to herself. When the unsuspecting William returned, both she and the pork were gone. He shouted at the foot of the stairs, but nobody answered, and so he went and informed the police; and the next day, P.C. Stubbs, in presence of Superintendent Stubbs, found the identical piece of pork concealed in her bed. Committed to one month's hard labour.

It appeared that after he had been drinking with the prisoner for some hours at the Tontine tap, he accompanied her home, where his basket was speedily eased of its contents of bread and pork, whilst he was gone after more beer. Prisoner pleaded guilty— 28 days to hard labour.

The memorial printed following his death described his preaching style.

```{admonition} Preaching with a "round good sense", *Memoir*, 1860
:class: dropdown

*[Brief memoir of the late Rev. W. Carus-Wilson](https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=DQ5hAAAAcAAJ), reprinted by permission from "The Christian Observer" ... With extracts from letters to soldiers in India, etc.* 1860,

His preaching was characterized less by profound thought or doctrinal argument, than by a fervent warmth, a depth of feeling, and (as it was once described) a "round good sense" which at once carried with him both the understanding and the hearts of his hearers; while his noble countenance and deep musical voice gave full effect to his words by arresting both the eye and the ear. His sermons, after the earlier years of his ministry, were never written; and the remarkable readiness and facility with which he preached could arise from nothing else but the constant and devoted occupation of his whole heart and mind with the one great object of his life—the saving of immortal souls. He seemed always ready; and whether he had come to his pulpit from the hurry of a journey or the retirement of his closet, could never have been argued from any difference in the depth and fervour of his preaching. A course of labour so various, so complicated, and so obnoxious to the advocates of cold orthodoxy and worldly wisdom, was not likely to be exempted from much misrepresentation. The principles of evangelical truth were far more singular, even thirty years ago, than happily they have become since; and in proportion to their rarity was the odium cast upon those who held up the light amidst the surrounding darkness. Mr. Carus-Wilson was assailed at various times and in various ways; but the surf-beaten rock abides, while the breakers which dash against it shiver themselves to atoms. Mr. Carus-Wilson's works remain as standing monuments of his zeal, and faith, and love to God and man. His name is affectionately cherished by numbers who regard him as their greatest benefactor for time and eternity. The institutions for which he laboured so assiduously and so long, remain to this day nurseries for heaven and pillars of the truth; and his memory will long be dear to many who have "owed to him their own selves also," and embalmed by the blessings of the poor, and of those "who had none to help them."

NEWPORT

St. John's Church.— On Sunday last two Sermons were preached at this place of worship, for the benefit of the Day Schools in connection therewith, by the Rev W. W. Carus Wilson, M.A., well known as a writer of popular tracts, and whose father established several charitable institutions,—one at Cowan Bridge, in Westmoreland, which Charlotte Bronte, the authoress of "Jane Eyre", was educated. Collections were made after each service, which were of a satisfactory character. The Day Schools in connection with St. John's Church contain 327 children, and, from their usefulness, are worthy the extended appreciation of the public.

Lecture.— A lecture will be delivered on Monday evening next, at 7 o'clock, in the Queen's rooms, by the Rev. W. Carus Wilson, "the Progress of Morality and Religion in the Sardinian, French, and English Armies; and with special reference to the important subject of Temperance." George Hale, Esq., governor of Parkhurst Penitentiary, has kindly consented to take the chair. The meeting is specially intended for soldiers, but the public will be accommodated as far as possible.

NEWPORT BOROUGH POLICE.

[Monday.— Before the worshipful the Mayor (W. B. Mew, Esq.), and H. Way, Esq.,]

Sleight of Hand-tricks.— James Rowan, a member of the wizard fraternity, was charged with conjuring a half-crown, by manipulations best known to himself and fellow-craftsmen, from the pocket of Andrew Attrill, and was convicted and sentenced to one week's imprisonment. Two other charges were brought against the prisoner— one for mysteriously exorcising a half-crown from the pocket of Mr. French, of the Rose and Crown; and another for securing to himself a half-sovereign by some peculiar, but discreditable means,——neither of which charges, however, were gone into.

[Tuesday.— Before R. M. Wavell, Esq. (in the chair), and J. H. Hearn, Esq.]

Injured Innocent.— William Spencer, a well-dressed young fellow with a fair amount of impudence, was charged by Edward Keary, lacemaker, residing near Coppin's-bridge, with attempting to pick his (Keary's) pocket, on Monday, "in the fair." Prosecutor said that about ten o'clock on the Monday night he was standing on the pavement outside a crowd of persons who had assembled in Quay-street, to witness the performance of a "little show." He stood with both hands in his pockets, and suddenly discovered a hand, which he knew was not his own, groping about in the vicinity of one of them. He turned round, and saw the prisoner walking off very fast down the street, prosecutor followed him to the Fountain Inn, where he gave prisoner in charge. Mr. Hearn asked whether prisoner came up behind the prosecutor, and whether the latter was satisfied the contiguity of prisoner's hand, to his (prosecutor's) pocket, was not the result of the rush. Mr. Keary answered in the affirmative, and was satisfied as to his attempt to pick his pocket. The Prisoner: Why, people never goes *behind* to endeavour to pick pockets —they always goes *before*. (A laugh.) James Wood, gardener, living in Pyle-street, corroborated the evidence of the last witness in every particular, and persisted in alluding to that individual, in addressing the prisoner as "that gentleman," with which the latter seemed somewhat pleased, satisfied that he had produced an effect on the Bench in his favour. The sequence, however, proved the supposition chimerical in the highest degree. Mr. Superintendent Grapes deposed to taking prisoner into custody, and stated, that he (prisoner) told him, in answer to enquiries, that he was a ship carpenter, and had come from Manchester. He had in his possession 6s. 6d. in silver, and 6 1/2d. in copper. Prisoner, in his defence, said he was "as innocent a child unborn !" and, as a guarantee of his respectability assured the Bench that he was of good family —his father being studgroom to the Hon. Francis Peters, —and he could refer them to "the Hon. Mr. Ashton, and Mr. Sidebotun" for a character, if they doubted his word. The Bench *did* doubt his word, and evinced their doubt thereof by sending him to prison for one month, and to be kept to hard labour,—a decision which the prisoner said he was "very sorry for, seeing as he was so innocent!"

George Coward charged Henry Underwood with striking him several times on Sunday night last, in Crocker-street. It appears he and others were drinking, and there were several skirmishes, and complainant, who was the least to blame, got most of the blows. Defendant declared he did not strike him at all, but P.C. Limington swore he struck him in bis presence, and he was fined 15s, including costs, which he paid.

The defendant, Henry Underwood, was now charged with striking three prostitutes, named Elizabeth Jackman, Ann Duffey, and Sarah Cosier. It appeared Coward was with them, and this caused the ill-feeling. He was mulcted in another 15s, which he also paid.

Henry Underwood was charged with assaulting George Coward.

Coward, sworn— I was coming up St. James-street last night, at 20 minutes to 11 o'clock, when this young man came across the road and struck me in the mouth. A person of the name of Salter was with him. They knocked me down and kicked me in the back. The defendant gave no reason for it.

Inspector G. Grapes, sworn— At 20 minutes to 11 o'clock, Coward came to me and said he had been knocked down. I went to Mr. Homan's comer and saw the policeman, who told me that Underwood was the person who struck the prisoner. He was the worse for liquor.

P.C. Linnington, sworn—I was at the Waggon and Horses, in Crocker-street. I heard a noise at the corner, and Coward came up and said that this young man had struck him. He came up at the time and struck him again in the face. He was not very drunk, nor very sober.

Cross examined by defendant— When Coward came up to me you came and struck him.

Defence— There was a scuffle, and I went across the road and my hat was knocked off. I did not strike him.

Fined 10s. and costs, or in default one month at Winchester.

Henry Underwood was charged with assaulting Elizabeth Jackman.

Elizabeth Jackman, sworn— Last night, at 20 minutes past 11 o'clock, I had been for a walk and was coming home. I was with George Coward and Sarah Cosier. I saw this man strike a young woman named Duffey, and I asked him why he did it. He made no answer, but struck me directly on the forehead with his fist.

Sarah Coster, sworn— I was in company with Elizabeth Jackman. I saw the defendant strike a girl named Duffey. She had said nothing to him. He first threw a stone at her and made her nose bleed. He then struck me on the side of my head. I told him I'd call the police. I saw him strike Elizabeth Jackman on the forehead.

Defence— I did not strike either of the girls.

Fined 10s., and the costs of the court.

In the passage he found another civilian, lying drunk on the floor with a common prostitute by his side. In one bed-room which the landlady unlocked he found two civilians and two prostitutes, in another bed-room one civilian and one prostitute, two civilians in another room, and another prostitute down stairs, most of whom were well supplied with beer. Defendant said he went to bed at eleven o'clock, and knew nothing about the matter. The Court said his conduct had been disgraceful, and they should fine him in the penalty of 3l. and costs, cautioning him that if he ever came there again he would not be let off so easily.

BOROUGH COURT. On Monday, before Dr. Wavell and E. Way, Rio.

"SHE WAS SITCH A SCREAMER!"

Caroline Pierce, Sarah Harvey, and Mary Ann Groundsell, three veiled young ladies, standing in class A 1 on the pave, were charged with being common disturbers of the peace.

P.C. Grey examined: Last Wednesday night, about a quarter to eleven, I was standing in front of the Market House, when I heard some disgraceful screeching and screaming in the Corn Market. I went in that direction, when I saw these women standing under the portico of the Newport Arms. One of them said, "Here comes the policeman," and then they turned about, and went in to the Newport Arms, and I went in and saw who they were. They were not sober, either of them, and there was no one else in the market, or in the house. They are common prostitutes.

Inspector Grapes examined: The inhabitants of the Corn Market are frequently making complaints of the nuisance created by these girls at late hours, and one of them has been committed for it, but it is of no use talking to them. These offences recur frequently, and on this occasion, you could hear their screams clear down to the Market House.

Defendants said they were not intoxicated, and that they never screamed. They were only enjoying a laugh together.

The Chairman: We are sorry to see young people brought before as on such disgraceful charges as these, and there is no doubt but you are frequently intoxicated. Your conduct is a nuisance to the town, and we shall now bind you over in the sum of £10 each, for your good behaviour for three months.

Defendants paid the fees of 5s. each, and were liberated, somewhat astonished at having escaped so easily, after having given the required bail.

Not so lucky.

Mary Ann Reed, Mary Ann Woodman, and Louisa Bannister, moving in class Z. 99, were charged with being drunk and disorderly in the public streets.

P.C. Tiley examined: On Thursday night about half past ten, I was on duty in St. James's-street, when I saw these girls, with about fourteen soldiers, come out of the Lame Dog. They were beastly drunk, and they came up through the streets swearing and hallooing, and using the most disgraceful language. I should have locked them up then, but for so many soldiers. Bannister fell down several times from drunkenness. They are common prostitutes.

Defendants said they were not drunk, and they never said nothink to nobody.

The Chairman: It is a very sad thing to see young women giving way to such practices, endangering both body and soul, and as such we are determined to try and put an end to it, we commit you for one month each, to the house of correction.

Another still.

Sarah Baxen, the last of the batch, was next charged by P.C. Jolliffe with being drunk and disorderly on Tuesday night, when witness would have taken her into custody, but for the interference of several soldiers, who set him at defiance, and who took her off to the Anchor Brewery. Fined 10s., and in default of payment committed for a fortnight.

William Hall, aged 16, was charged with stealing a gold ring, the property of his mother.—Emma Head said she was the wife of John Head, but lived apart from her husband, and the prisoner was her son. Last November she was living at Barton's Village, and missed her wedding ring from under a glass case on the mantel-piece. She had lost several other articles some time before. When she asked the prisoner about the ring, he said that he had not taken it. She had not seen it since then until Thursday last. The ring now produced was the same; it was marked "22 I.W.," and was bought at a pawn-shop.—Mary Ann Cooper said she lived at the Orange Tree beershop, in Pyle-street, and knew Hall. In December last he came to the beershop with a gold ring on his little finger, and offered it for sale, but Mrs. James refused to buy it. He then put it into her hand, and asked her to give him some beer for it, and she gave him five pints. She wore it for some time, and afterwards pawned it, but took it out again, and wore it up to Thursday last, when she gave to P.C. Hunt. The prisoner pleaded guilty, and, having been previously convicted four times within two years, he was sentenced six months' imprisonment, with hard labor.

The defence was that she knew nothing at all about the thing. The clothes were identified by a corporal of the 64th Regiment.

ISLE OF WIGHT PETTY SESSIONS. BOROUGH COURT. Monday.— The borough magistrates in attendance were Mr. F. Pittis, Captain W. S. Graham, and Mr. F. Vulliamy.

Charges brought against the keeper of a refreshment house.— Mary Ann Tribbick, keeper of a small coffee-house in Town-lane, was charged by the police with harbouring prostitutes and other disorderly persons. Mr. H. R. Hooper appeared on behalf of the defendant. — Mr. Superintendent Grapes said one of the constables called his attention to a noise in defendant's house, about 1.15 a.m. on Sunday, the 3rd instant. He went and rapped at the door and, after waiting some little time was admitted. In a small back room he found eleven men and one woman, a common prostitute named Elkins. Nearly all of them were drunk, and some were lying on the floor. The woman Elkins lives close by the house. Was not aware that she went in occasionally to assist the defendant in her business.— Policeman Tiley corroborated the main facts in the preceding evidence. There were two or three men in the front room.— Mr. Hooper submitted that no case had been made out against defendant. There was only one woman present, and she a neighbour assisting in the business, therefore the charge or harbouring common prostitutes fell to the ground. It would be straining a point too far to convict his client upon such evidence.— Mr. Pittis, as chairman, said the bench would hear the second charge before deciding upon the first.—Police-man Tiley then gave evidence on the second charge of harbouring prostitutes. On the morning of Wednesday, the 6th instant, he was in search of a soldier who was absent from barracks without leave, and went to defendant's house about noon. He was answered at the window by two prostitutes, who said they were locked in and could not open the door. Witness was satisfied that he had heard a man's voice in the house. He then went through the adjoining premises, scaled a wall and entered the house by the back door. On searching the house he found a private of the 11th Regiment. The women, in answer to a question, said defendant went out and locked the door after her before they were up, and she had not returned. Witness was aware that defendant let beds.— Mr. Hooper said his instructions were that the women on Tuesday night went there for a bed and slept together. The soldier came in for a bed, after they had retired, and slept by himself in a room on another floor. If the police were making a raid on these houses, they had certainly brought forward two very weak cases. He felt satisfied that the bench would not convict.— The Chairman said it would be straining the law too tightly to convict; they should, therefore, dismiss the complaints.

Mary Ann Tribbick is back in court again, although this time as a victim of a theft, in September 1869.

BOROUGH COURT.-Monday.-Before the Mayor (R. Pinnock, Esq.) and F. Pittis, and F. Vulliamy, Esqrs.

Harriet Sheath, of Ryde, was charged with stealing a petticoat.— Mary Ann Tribbick, wife of George Tribbick, said: I live at the "Tontine," Newport. On the evening of the 26th of August the prisoner came to my house and asked for lodgings. She remained in the house until Thursday morning. On the evening of the same day I missed a petticoat, which I had seen in my bedroom on the morning before she left the house. She had taken it while I was absent getting milk. The petticoat produced is the one I lost. My maiden name is upon it.— Police-constable Tiley witnessed to taking the prisoner into custody. She said she had not stolen the petticoat, and that it might have been her sister. I then took her to Mrs. Tribbick, who said she was the person whom she suspected, and she was at last found wearing it.—The prisoner pleaded guilty, and was sentenced to 21 days' imprisonment with hard labour in the Winchester House of Correction.- Caroline Jacobs was summoned for using abusive language towards Amelia Sheath.—The case was dismissed.

At the Borough Licensing Day of September 1869, it seems that town's citizenry had been writing memorials again, although this time is seems to be targeted against the abuse of licensing hours as much as anything. Notably, South-street and the Tontine Tap get a mention, and not necessarily for positive reasons.

BOROUGH COURT.-Monday.-Before the Mayor (R. Pinnock, Esq.) and F. Pittis, and F. Vulliamy, Esqrs.— Liceasing Day.-After the clerk had read several extracts from the new Wine and Beerhouse Act, and from the Habitual Criminals Act, the Mayor said that the magistrates had received a memorial signed by 500 residents of the borough, of Newport. requesting them to refuse licenses to the landlords of those houses which had not been properly kept. A great many complaints had been made of several publicans opening their houses on a Sunday before the proper time, and the magistrates had resolved for the future to be more strict with such houses. William Woodford, of the "Valiant Soldier," South-street, and Charles Morris, of the "Waggon and Horses," Crocker-street, having been complained of, the magistrates, in granting their licenses, informed the applicants that the police would be instructed to keep a watchful eye upon their houses. —...-Mr. Howes, of. the "Tontine" beershop, applied for and was refused his license because he had been fined three times during the past year for irregularities in his house. John Micffin was refused his license for the "Horse and Groom," Upper Pyle-street, from insufficiency of rating.—Henry James was refused his license for the "Orange Tree," Upper Pyle-street, for being twice convicted during the past year, and for the house not having been decently conducted. ...

NEWPORT BOROUGH POLICE COURT. On Monday, at the Town Hall, before the Mayor (B. Pinnock, Esq.), Francis Pittis, Esq., and F. Valliamy, Esq.

OBSTRUCTING A PICQUET SERGEANT.

Ann Maria Braker, a prostitute, was charged with using indecent language to Sergeant Brown, of the 64th, and obstructing him in the execution of his duty as sergeant of the picquet.

Sergeant George Brown, of the 64th Regiment, stated that on Saturday night he was in charge of the picquet. He went into the King's Arms in search of absentees, and there saw the prisoner, who used the most abusive language to him. He afterwards went to the Anchor Brewery beerhouse, and on coming out, again saw the prisoner, who there used very indecent language to him.

P.C. Jacobs deposed that on Saturday evening, abut ten o'clock, he went to the Anchor Brewery beerhouse at the request of Sergeant Brown, and there heard the prisoner use indecent language to the sergeant. Witness then took her into custody.

The Bench fined defendant 5s., with 5s. costs; seven days' hard labour in default of payment.

## Miss Emily Kent

One name that keeps recurring in the court reports throughout the 1860s is a certain Miss Emily Kent, resident of the House of Industry, whose repeated bad behaviour kept landing her stints of hard labour in Winchester gaol. Despite recognising that the sentences were not having effect on changing her behaviour, the court kept sending her back for more. We can easily imagine "thank you, gentlemen," as her stock reply.

Harriet Cooper and Emily Kent, two girls of the House of Industry, were brought up in custody charged with disorderly behaviour, and doing wilful damage, on the previous Monday.—The evidence of Elizabeth Mursell, nurse at the union, went to show that she ordered the prisoners to do their work, which they refused to do and became exceedingly abusive, making use of the most disgusting language. They then took off their shoes and threw them at the windows, Cooper breaking 24 panes of glass, and Kent 16. Besides this, they wrote very obscene language on the walls, which she was obliged to have whitewashed.—The prisoners, who had been before convicted for similar offences, were sentenced to six weeks' imprisonment, with hard labor.

Emily Kent, an inmate of the House of Industry, was placed at the bar, being her sixth time brought before the Court, charged with unruly and disorderly conduct. —Elizabeth Muraell, a nurse at the house, stated that on the previous Monday, between 12 and 1 o'clock in the day, she went into the receiving ward and found the defendant there, and told her to come out, and she said yes, by-and-bye. Witness then told her it was the Governor's orders that she should come out, but she said she would not, and then sat down at the door till tea time. She, however, went and had her tea, and went back to the ward again, and one of the nurses told her that she had been cutting the table. On taxing her with it she said yes she did cut half, and another girl cut the other half. She then ordered her out, but defendant said she would stop there altogether if she liked. Witness told her she would go and tell the Governor, and went out, but did not do so; and as the other girl left she went away. She afterwards told her to pick her oakum, which she refused do. She then saw something lying on the stones, which she found to be her cap that she had torn to pieces, and shortly after she tore her apron and then her neckerchief.— The Chairman said that she appeared most incorrigible, and that the punishment she had received had done her no good. The Court would therefore sentence her to another six weeks' imprisonment, with such hard labor befitting her sex, to which the prisoner replied, "Thank you, gentlemen."
