# A Barracks Town, a New Mayor and a New Church

It's the mid-1850s, and Britain is one of the allied forces sending off her young men to fight in the Crimea. In Newport, on the Isle of Wight, the troops are temporarily stationed in Parkhurst Barracks before making their way to Portsmouth, and the troop ships that await them.

For the young soldiers, many of them in their late teens or early twenties, entertainment is to be found in the public houses of Newport, and the arms of the women who ply their trade there.

TOWN COUNCIL

A general meeting of the council was held  in the Council Chamber, at the Guildhall, on Tuesday last, for general business. The names of the members of the council being called over, the town clerk gave notice that the first business to be transacted was the

ELECTION OF A MAYOR.

Upon which Thomas Cooke, Esq., after passing very high compliment the late mayor for the conscientious fulfilment of his duties during the last year, and proposed Mr. Francis Pittis to fill that office for this borough for the ensuing year, and in doing so, bore testimony to his high character and ability, and although he was unwilling when first asked to be proposed fill the office, he had now consented ; and he therefore felt great pleasure in proposing him.

Edward Way, Esq..said it wiiswithgreat pleasure that he seconded the nomination of Mr. Francis Pittis, as the mayor of the Borough of Newport, as he is a native of the town and much respected, and one that he (Mr. Way) himself had been acquainted with for many years.

There being no opposition, Mr. Pittis was then sworn in, and the ex-mayor resigned his seat into his hands ; which being properly occupied, the mayor, said, —the first step I consider for me to take in filling this chair, is to return you my sincere and heartful thanks for placing me here, and I very sensible of the honor conferred upon me in being placed in this position, and when I feel that it has been by the unanimous voice of this meeting, not one vote being accorded against me this day, it is most gratifying to me, and will help to carry through this important function which is the highest you could have placed upon me. I shall feel it my duty to dismiss everything like party or political feelings from my breast, and will endeavour so far as possible to do everything that may be conducive to the prosperity of the town of Newport. I hope therefore that you will give me that support which my office requires from you.

...

He was also reappointed for a second term the year afterwards.

NEWPORT, Saturday, August 5. St. Thomas's Church.— The foundation-stone of the new church is intended to be laid, on the 24th instant, by his Royal Highness Prince Albert. Invites have been sent to the Provincial Grand Master and the Masonic brethren, the authorities of the Island, the members, the Magistrates, Mayor and Corporation, the Bishop of Winchester, the Archdeacon of the Diocese, the Rural Dean, and the clergy of tba Island, the officers of the Garrison, &c. snd we imagine the sight will be the grandest that we shall have witnessed in the Island for years.

The Mayor hoped the town officials should welcome to the Prince in "a becoming manner", although one of the councillors, Mr Pinnock, a dissenter, hoped that anyone not attending becuase of differening religious views would not be castigated for showing an assumed disloyalty to the Queen's consort. Pittis magnanimously suggested he would be pleased to see everyone there, and let the matter drop.

NEWPORT TOWN COUNCIL. [Tuesday, the Mayor, F. Pittis, esq. in the chair]

...

PRINCE ALBERT'S VISIT TO LAY THE FOUNDATION STONE.

The Chairman observed that as her Majesty's Royal Consort had most graciously condescended to visit their ancient town at the end of the month, for the purpose of laying the foundation stone of their new church, he thought it was proper that he should be received by the offlcials of the town in a becoming manner. He therefore begged to invite the Corporation to meet him on the auspicioua occasion ; and other arrangements were being made, with the view of giving the Prince a suitable reception. 

Mr. Pinnock. hoped that if any of the Council were absent on that day, it would not be construed into a want of loyalty for their Prince. Some of their body objected to processions, and wearing gowns; and he and others dissented from the doctrines of the Church of England. Therefore they could scarcely be expected to assist in laying the foundation atone of a church which denounces them some thirteen times a year.

The Mayor again observed he should be happy to see them all, and the subject dropped.

Advertisements announcement the layin gof the foundation stone appeared in the local press, and tickets were sold for seats from which the cermeony could be observed in order to raise additional funds for the rebuilding works.

A Provincial Grand Lodge will be held at the Masonic Hall, Lugley-street, Newport, on Thursday, 24th August next. The Lodge will be closed tyled at eleven a.m. when a Procession will be formed to attend on H.R.H.

A large public crowd was expected for the event — up to 2000 spectators — and a fine banquet was anticipated for the lucky few who would get to attend.

A royal connection with the earlier Church buildings was also recalled, in the form of the last resting place of Princess Elizabeth — second daughter of King Charles I, who had died on September 8th, 1650 — about which another story can be told.

NEWPORT, Saturday, August 12.

The Old Church is fast disappearing, and workmen are clearing the north-eastern side, for the purpose of arranging for the laying the foundation-stone— (see advertisement). We believe room will be allotted for nearly 2000 spectators, and everything is being done to render the anxiously looked-for day one of the most auspicious our town has ever witnessed. We can conscientiously say that there is but one feeling amongst all classes, that of unmixed desire to give the Prince a reception worthy of his high position and his exalted character. The banquet to be given by the committee will be on a scale of excellence and elegance ; answers to the invitations have been nearly all received, and we have no doubt that this part of the matter will pass off with credit to all parties. We would recommend our friends to secure tickets as soon as possible, as there is even now a great demand for them. We have been given to understand that it is the gracious intention of her Majesty to erect a monument to the Princess Elizabeth, daughter of the unfortunate Charles I. Nothing can be more graceful than this act of our beloved Sovereign. There is a sympathy in it for the fate of one of royal blood, and another evidence of her Majesty's good wishes for our church and town. We gave some information respecting this unfortunate Princess a few weeks ago. The vault in which her remains lay was discovered in 1793, near the altar, wben the church was undergoing some repairs; a stone with the initials "E. S." simply marking the spot. On the coffin appeared the following inscription :—

ELIZABETH 2ND DAUGHTER OF THE LATE KING CHARLES. DECE'D SEPT. 8. MDCL.
 
In order to more particularly mark the spot, the Church-wardens removed an old copper plate from the churchyard wall, which had been placed there in 1707, to the memory of a respected minister of their parish named Shergold, on the back of which they caused to be engraved the inscription to the illustrious Princess Elizabeth, which has already appeared in this paper, and was laid into a stone immediately in front of the altar. On removing this piate, within the last few days, the following quaint inscription to the clergyman was found at the back :—

HERE LYETH YE BODY OF MASTER GEORGE SHERGOLD LATE MINISTER OF NEWPORT WHO DURING SIXTEEN YEARS IN DISCHARGE OF HIS OFFICE STRICTLY OBSERVED YE TRUE DISCIPLINE OF YE CHURCH OF ENGLAND DISLIKING THAT DEAD BODIES SHOULD BE BURIED IN GODS HOUSE APPOINTED TO BE INTERRED IN THIS PLACE HE DYED UNIVERSALLY LAMENTED AND ESTEEMED JANUARY XXIII 1707.

From a MS. in the British Museum, entitled " Church Motes in the Isle of Wight," and bearing the date of March, 1719, we learn that this tablet was on the churchyard wall, and as it conveyed a rebuke on the practice which very generally prevailed at the close of the last century, of burying within the church, it was probably selected to supply the material for the inscription over the resting place of the Princess, when accidently opened in 1793.

```

The weather was not so good the evening before. The wind was blowing a hurricane, and there were regualr showers. Earlier that day, the magistrates had overseen the Annual Licensing Day, where several new licenses were granted, licensees were reminded that "public houses are not to be kept open from ten to six on Sundays, Christmas-day, Good Friday, public fasts, and thanksgivings", and "George Machett, of the Blue Ball, was cautioned as to his house being frequented by prostitutes".

But God must have been looking favourably on the event, for Thursday, August 14th, 1854, dawned as a sunny morning, and by 11 am, the streets, which were decorated with garlands of flowers and celebratory arches, were lined by thousands of spectators.

NEWPORT, Saturday, August 26.

GRAND CEREMONY OF LAYING THE FOUNDATION STONE OF THE NEW CHURCH OF SAINT THOMAS'S, NEW- PORT, ISLE OF WIGHT.

As we anticipated in our last, the inhabitants of Newport witnessed on Thursday the grandest and most important day that had ever been known in the ancient borough. The preceding evening was remarkably unfavourable ; the wind blew quite a hurricane, and copious showers seemed to portend anything but a propitious Thursday. Nevertheless, the weather-glass " looked up," and hundreds awoke with thankful hearts on beholding a delightful sunny morning, which was rendered the more pleasant by the sprinkling over night.

The day was ushered in with a merry peal from the mellow bells of the old tower of St. Thomas, and the borough exhibited the appearance of a general holiday- the business of the town was almost entirely suspended, and flags and banners, with numerous devices, were to be seen pendant from the principal houses of the town. The approaches to the borough were variously decorated, and several beautiful arches, with appropriate devices, were erected in the principal tboroogbfares. The "Albert Arch," decorated with the Prince's royal arms and other devices, was situated at the bottom of the High-street. The next arch was opposite the Town Hall, having the borough arms, and representing the Corporation of the borough of Newport. A third was in the Corn Market, and termed, "The Clerical Arch," with the Right Rev. The Lord Bishop of Winchester's arms ; and a fourth, in the vicinity of the Bugle inn—a most splendid affair, called " the National Arch." There were other devices in the upper part of the town, the Beast and Corn Markets, Node-hill, &c. In every direction flags of every conceivable hue and colour met the eye, displayed from the most prominent situations, and scarcely a house of any size or importance but was profusely decorated with garlands of flowers bouquets, evergreens, and complimentary devices. In the main streets, garlands of flowers were suspended from side to side and the remains of the old church were also profusely decorated. Immense numbers of persons from all parts of the Island flocked in at an early hour, and, with bands of music and banners the whole scene presented a very grand and imposing effect.

At eleven o'clock, thousands of persons were assembled in the principal streets, and most of the shops immediately closed. Soon after, a guard of honour, consisting of about 200 troops of the Garrison, defiled in front of the Hall, and the Royal Marine Band struck up a pleasing strain.

```

The councillors met, the clergy met, the Masons met, and then they all convened at the Guildhall, with the rest of the procession assembling at Quay-street, to await the arrival of Prince Albert.

The Members of the Town Council met at the residence of the Mayor, at half-past eleven o'clock, and accompanied him to the Town Hall.

The Bishop and about twenty of the Clergy assembled for the purpose of robing, at twelve o'clock, at the residence of the Rev. G H. Connor, and proceeded from thence in procession to the Town Hall.

The officers and brethren of the several Lodges assembled at the Masonic Hall at eleven o'clock, when a Grand Lodge of the province of the Isle of Wight was held, and a procession formed by twelve o'clock, which proceeded to the Guildhall, where the procession remained, to await the arrival of his Royal Highness Prince Albert.

Between twelve and one, the various bodies intended to form the procession were to be seen emerging from their different rendezvous, for the purpose of assembling in Quay-street.

The elaborate procession assembled, in order of rank, and made its way towards the Church, the Prince chatting as they went with the Bishop of Winchester and Francis Pittis, the Mayor.

The whole mass now moved forward towards the church, the Prince conversing with the Worshipful the Mayor and the Bishop. When the procession arrived at the tower of St. Thomas's Church, it halted, and divided right and left, for the Right Worshipful the Provincial Grand Master and the Provincial Grand Officers to pass up the centre, preceded by his banner and Sword Bearer, and followed by the remainder of the procession, until the whole had entered the enclosure around the stone.

```

Seating galleries surrounded the site where the foundation stone would be laid, the invited dignitaries arranged around it. Military bands continued to provide music as and when appropriate.

A rather elaborate ritual was then played out. Firstly, the stone was raised, Prince Albert was shown a copy of the plans, and "a bottle, containing the coins of the realm and parchment roll, were deposited in a cavity beneath the stone [and the] The foundation stone was then partly lowered". An inscribed and elaborately decorated silver trowel was presented to Prince Albert, who used it to spread cement on the lower stone before "the upper stone was let down slowly, with solemn music", and his Royal Highness made a dedication, before givin the stone three strokes with a mallet.

The Freemasons then performed their ritual. The senior masons proved the stone to be properly laid using plumbrule, level and square, and the Provincial Grand Master gave three knocks using a maul presented to him by the Architect, "at the same time invoking the blessing of the Grand Architect of the Universe", whereup the brethren responded.— *So mote it be.*. The Provincial Grand Master gave the plan tools to the builder, before scattering corn and pouring wine and oil upon the stone. The Provincial Grand Chaplain closed that part of the ceremony with an appropriate prayer, in response to which the brethren again chanted *So mote it be*.

Spacious galleries had been erected, and these were filled by the fashionables of the Island, with a good sprinkling of military and naval uniforms. The stone was suspended by a pulley from supports decorated with evergreens. It was very large, and beautifully chiselled for the occasion. We understand it was the gift of Mr. Joseph Poore, of Newport. It bore the following inscription, engraved on a brass plate: —"On Thursday, August 24th, A.D., 1854, this foundation stone was laid by his Royal Highness the Prince Albert, Francis Pittis, Mayor; George Henry Connor, M.A. Minister; Edward Way, Henry Loosemore, Church-wardens."

His Royal Highness, accompanied by the Mayor and Masonic officers, walked through the portal of the church tower, and the positions were taken up as follows :—

Town Clerk, Equerries. The Bishop's Chaplain, James Eldridge, esq. Rev. E. M'All.  
The Mayor, F. Pittis, esq. His Royal Highness Prince Albert. The Lord Bishop of   Winchester.  
The Mayor's Chaplain, Rev. Mr. Wallis. THE STONE. The Rev. E. D. Scott, Vicar of Carisbrooke.

Senior Warden, Mr. E. Way. Junior Warden, Mr. Loosemore. Builders, Messrs. T. and J. Dashwood, of Ryde.  
Surrounded by the Corporation and the whole Clergy of the Island. The choir and band were allotted a portion of one of the galleries.

His Royal Highness viewed the brilliant assembly with evident interest while the stone was being raised. The Bishop of Winchester then said aloud, " The glorious Majesty of the Lord our God be upon us ! Prosper Thou the work of our hands upon us ! O, prosper Thou our handy work."

Psalm cxxxii., verses 3 to 16 inclusive, was then repeated alternately by the Bishop and Clergy and a large number of the spectators.

The architect of the building then presented to his Royal Highness the working plans of the church, and explained to him its proposed accommodation, after which a bottle, containing the coins of the realm and parchment roll, were deposited in a cavity beneath the stone. The foundation stone was then partly lowered, and a silver trowel presented to Prince Albert.

The trowel, provided by Mr. Dudley, silversmith, was of most chaste workmanship, and bore the following inscription :— "St Thomas's church, Newport, Isle of Wight. The foundation stone laid by his Royal Highness Prince Albert, August 24tb, 1854. Francis Pittis, Mayor." On the back were his Royal Highness's arms, surrounded by the Order of the Garter, very elaborately executed.

His Royal Highness then spread the cement on the lower stone, the upper stone was let down slowly, with solemn music, and his Royal Highness said, "We place this stone in faith and hope to the glory of God, through Jesus Christ our Lord."

The stone being adjusted, and his Royal Highness having given it three strokes with a mallet, the Provincial Grand Master approached the stone, and proved it to be properly laid by the plumbrule, presented by the J.G.W. ; the level, presented by the S.G.W. ; and the square, presented by the D.P.G.M.

The Architect then delivered the maul to the Provincial Grand Master, who gave three knocks, at the same time invoking the blessing of the Grand Architect of the Universe, and the brethren responded.— *So mote it be.*

The Provincial Grand Master delivered the plan and tools to the builder, for his use, after which he scattered corn and poured wine and oil upon the stone.

The Provincial Grand Chaplain then gave the appropriate prayer, the brethren again responding— *So mote it be*, when the Provincial Grand Master announced to his Royal Highness and the Mayor that the stone was laid.

It was then the turn of the Bishop to Winchester to say the Church prayers.

The Bishop of Winchester then audibly repeated the folowing prayers:—

"O, Almighty God, who hast built Thy Church upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the head corner-stone, grant us so to be joined together in unity of spirit by their doctrine, that we may be made an holy temple, acceptable unto Thee, through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen."

" O most glorious Lord God, we acknowledge that we are not worthy to offer unto Thee anything belonging to us; yet we beseech Thee, of Thine infinite goodness, graciously to accept and bless our intention of rebuilding in this place a house, which may be for ever dedicated to Thy honour and service. May the people bring forth the head-stone thereof with shoutings, crying ' Grace, grace unto it !' May the glory of this latter house be greater than the glory of the former. May faithful men be raised up from generation to generation, who within its walls may proclaim the glad tidings of salvation and the riches of Divine grace. May Thine holy days be here remembered —Thy sacraments duly administered and reverently received— the youth instructed— the aged reminded of their duty, and exhorted to persevere unto the end— and all builded up as living temples of the Holy Ghost, that Thou mayest bless us, and we may honour Thee, through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen."

The Lord's Prayer followed, after which the following appropriate hymn was sung by a most effective choir, accompanied by selected instruments from the Royal Marine band, led by Mr. John Mew, the organist of St. Thomas's church :—

This stone to thee in faith we lay;  
To thee this temple. Lord, we build;  
Thy power and goodness here display,  
And be it with thy presence fill'd.

Here, when thy people seek thy face,  
And dying sinners pray to live. 
Hear thon in heaven, thy dwelling-place ;  
And when thou nearest, Lord, forgive !

Thy glory never hence depart ;  
Yet choose not, Lord, this house alone :  
Thy kingdom come to ev'ry heart ;  
In ev'ry bosom fix thy throne !

```

With the benediction complete, the Bishop thanked the Prince Consort, who responded in turn, before departing.

The invited guests then repaired to the Town Hall to await the serving of lunch, with the Fremmasons returning to their Grand Lodge to resume their business before a three o'clock at the Star Hotel.

The benediction having been given, The Bishop of Winchester then said— Your Royal Highness, I tender to you, on behalf of the Mayor and Town Council of this ancient borough, of this island, and of the assembled multitude of inhabitants whom your Royal Highness can see around you, their respectful and grateful acknowledgments for your great condescension in coming amongst us on this interesting occasion. It will be out of place for me to make any lengthened observations; but the inhabitants would, indeed, have gone away with sad hearts if they were not allowed an opportunity of thus expressing the feelings they entertain towards your Royal Highness. It is the greatest of comforts to us to be enabled to do so ; I speak not only in the name of the clergy and people of this island, but in that of the people of Great Britain, who, as I have said, consider it a subject of great comfort in seeing in their beloved Sovereign and in their beloved Sovereign's Prince Consort those who not only evince so great a desire to dignify their position by doing everything that is valuable to the welfare of our country, but in themselves set a bright example of all that can ennoble the people. As one of the clergy of this country, I consider that your Royal Highness's attendance this day is better than a thousand sermons. It shows that a hearty interest and sympathy are felt by our gracious Sovereign, and by your Royal Highness, in an event so interesting to the people of this town and to the people of this Island. We see in it an additional proof of the interest our gracious Sovereign and your Royal Highness take in the welfare of this Island.

His Royal Highness, who was evidently much gratified, said— My lord, allow me to express to you the feeling of gratification I have this day experienced in being amongst you and assisting you in the performance of this holy work, and in doing so I wish also to bear testimony to the great interest the Queen takes in all matters of this kind in the nation at large, and in the welfare of thia Island in particular. I thank you for this honour —(loud cheers).

The ceremony being completed, the procession was again formed, and returned to the Town Hall, and on reaching the north door, it stopped, and fell back in double line, to allow his Royal Highness to pass through the entire procession, to the Town Hall. His Royal Highness had a few minutes conversation with the Mayor, and re-entered his carriage amidst hearty congratulation.

The guests afterwards retired to the arcade of the Town Hall, until luncheon was announced. The Masonic brethren repaired to their lodge-room, where the business of the Grand Lodge was resumed, and at three o'clock they dined at the Star Hotel.

The 77th Regiment, under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel White, formed the guard of honour on the occasion, the other line of procession being kept by detachments from the 20th and 28th Regiments.
 
The bands of the Royal Marines and the 4th Regiment performed " most eloquent music" during the day, as well as several local bands of the neighbourhood.

In a Town Hall profusely decorated with flowers and paintings of the new Church. The tables were resplendent with silver cups and dishes, "covered with every delicacy and the choicest wines". The principal guests took their seats on a raised platform, the Mayor (Francis Pittis) and the Bishop of Winchester in in pride of place, whereup the Mayor raised a toast to the Her most grapcious majesty, the Queen, and the band fired up the National Anthem to great cheering.

The Town Hall was externally covered with evergreens and flowers, while internally the scene was of a magnificent character. At one end, appropriated to the principal guests, was a dais, over which was displayed the banner of Newport, and around the room were hung festoons of laurels and flowers, with devices in dahlias and other flowers. The tables were covered with every delicacy and the choicest wines, the banquet being provided by Messrs. Mew, of the Bugle inn. There were several beautiful paintings adorning the walls, with the designs for the new church, and the fine life-like full-length portrait of the late Sir Leonard Holmes. The tables were bedecked with several massive silver epergnes, cups, and dishes. The Mayor took the chair, supported on his right by the Bishop of Winchester and on the left by General Lord Downes, the Ven. Archdeacon Wigram, Colonel Rumley, Colonel Delacombe, T. W. Fleming, esq. The whole of the clergy of the Island, and amongst the general company were Lieutenant- Colonel Dwyer, Captain Symonds, Lieutenant and Adjutant Driver, Lieutenant Pearse, Lieutenant Taylor, Dr. Wilday, M.D. Commander Adams. Captain Daly, Captain Henries, Captain Scott, Lieutenant Wesley, Captain Gordon, R.M. Lieutenant Manners, Lieutenant Waterworth. Captain Crozier, R.N. Hon. A'Court Holmes, Colonel Harcourt, M.P., Admiral Symonds, Le Marchant Thomas, esq. Sir Henry Oglander, bart. A. J. Hambrough, esq. B. Kerr, esq. L. P. Lind, esq. &c. The principal members of the Corporation, including Messrs. Hearn, Estcourt, Pragnell, Jewell, H. Mew, E. Way, J. Way, &c. were present.

Grace having been said by the Rev. Allen Wallace,  
the Mayor called upon the assembly to charge their glasses, and proposed the health of her most gracious Majesty the Queen. The toast had always been received with every demonstration of loyalty, and he felt assured all present would do honour to it— (great cheering, the band performing the National Anthem).

But for some, however, it seems they were not invited to the ball, as the rather bitter correspondent from the *Isle of Wight Observer* commented:

[SIMILAR REPORT TO ELSEWHERE]

...

[NOTABLE GUESTS] [a]nd about 180 of the principal personages of the island filled the surrounding tables. We hear that this banquet off with éclat; but owing to the spirit of exclusiveness which the Committee was actuated in inviting only a portion of the press, we are sorry we cannot afford our patrons that full report which we usually do of such aristocratic gatherings; but have no doubt they, with us, will feel with us that such a petty and ridiculous distribution of their favours in no way redounds to their credit. It will have this effect that the most aristocratic portion of the Island visitors will be saved the trouble of wading through the after-dinner stereotype speeches used on such occasions.

Owing to the late hour the Freemason's banquet came off the report is postponed till next week.

We cannot close our report without making mention of the scurvy treatment got at the hands of the managers of this pageant. With a partiality, as rare as it is contemptible, they invited *portion* of the Press only, albeit they were glad to accept of the gratuitous puffing of *all*. Let this not be understood as the language of complaint; but rather as showing another instance of the unscrupulous manner in which some will " grind their axe" upon others. We have, however, discharged our duty to the subscribers and patrons of the *Observer* in the best manner we possibly could under such unusual and grossly partial circumstanccs.

The Queen duly toasted, Mayor Pittis then raised a toast to "the illustrious Prince" and the other members of the royal family, followed by a toast to the health of the  Lord Bishop of Winchester and his faithful clergy.

```{admonition} The Mayor's toasts to the Prince and the Bishop
:class: dropdown
The Mayor said he now rose to propose the health of the illustrious Prince, who had that day honoured them with his presence on the occasion of laying the foundation stone of a building dedicated to Almighty God. His Royal Highness had conferred a lasting obligation upon the inhabitants of Newport, and had set a noble example to the junior members of the Royal family. He trusted all would join with him in the prayer that the blessing of God might descend upon the great work of the day ; and he hoped that the building, the foundation of which they had so auspiciously laid, might rise in all its beautiful proportions, and that thousands yet unborn might worship beneath its portals— (cheers).

The Mayor proposed the health of his Royal Highness the Prince of Wales and the other members of the Royal family. This day would be an illuminated page in the history of the Island, and of the country, and the rich and poor, peasant and peer might look to the Throne for example. The Royal family were the nation's hope; and his wish was that God might confer his blessing upon them, and that they might shine like gems around the diadem of our beloved Sovereign— (cheers).

The Mayor desired to propose the health of the Lord Bishop of Winchester and the clergy who had done them the honour to assemble on the occasion— (cheers). It would ill become him, in the presence of his lordship, to offer any laudatory remarks; but in these momentous times they, as laymen, must not forget the high privileges which they enjoyed. It was most consolatory to them to know that the clergy of the Island, when difficulties beset their path, applied with confidence to the Lord Bishop for advice and counsel— for the advice of one who bad always shown himself unwavering in the principles of our reformed religion— (cheers). He thanked the clergy for the assistance they had rendered and the honour they had done him on the occasion, and he was quite sure that those around him would respond to the toast with enthusiasm—(great cheering).

```

The Bishop of WInchester accepted the toast to him with thanks, and a game of propose-and-accept-the-toast began.

In passing the Mayor noted that:

> In the first place there was a strong feeling that the church should be renovated, but this being found impossible, they then set themselves to the work of erecting a new building, and they pledged themselves, collecting subscriptions from year to year, to commence the building within a period of five years. They had to fight a great battle to get together their funds, and had carried out their intention at the expiration of the fifth year of their labours

and commended those responsible for "raising between £7000 and £8000" to support the cause.

The "separation of Newport from the united parishes of Carisbrooke and Northwood" into its own parish was also announced to great cheers.

```{admonition} The toast is responded to, and other toasts follow
:class: dropdown

The Lord Bishop of Winchester, addressing the assembly as Mr. Mayor, his lordship, and gentlemen, said he rose without a moment's hesitation to offer on behalf of the clergy of the Island, and in his own name, their respectful acknowledgments for the honour which had just been paid to them. He might truly say that this day was one of unmixed gratification to him. He had looked forward, now through many years, to the day which should see the foundation-stone laid of that edifice, which he trusted would prove one of the best buildings of the town, in every sense of the term, and become a credit not only to that place but to the whole Island— (cheers). He looked to the church, which, under God's blessing they hoped to raise within the town, not merely as an architectural building, although in that view he should not be the last to acknowledge its merits ; but he looked to it as a spot where those who came after them, as well as themselves while they remained here on earth, might repair for consolation and instruction in righteousness— (hear, hear, and cheers). He considered that the auspices under which the church had been commenced that day should lead them to expect a happy termination of the work—(hear, hear). The introduction which the Mayor had given relative to the Royal family, had reminded him of the many obligations they owed to the Royal personage who had so condescendingly honoured them with his presence— (cheers). His Royal Highness Prince Albert had manifested a deep interest in all works for the advancement of art and science and in addition to the efforts made for the advancement of literature, science, and art in this country— to which such a response Mhad been made— Royal Highness united in that which must be most dear to them, a deep feeling for the moral and religious welfare of the people of this country—(cheers). He saw in the presence of his Royal Highness that day that he took an interest in the spiritual welfare of our countrymen, and he recognised in a proof that their Royal neighbour, the Sovereign of this country, as well as her Royal Consort, were willing to be ranked, not only as the Sovereign of ihe country and the Royal Consort of the Sovereign but as neighbours to them— (great cheering). These were truly auspicious circumstances, and he might well call upon the Mayor in common with his fellow townsmen to rejoice and give God thanks for that which would long be remembered as a day of unmingled happiness amongst the townsmen of the Island— (cheers). He begged to return, on behalf of himself and on behalf of the clergy of the Island, their respectful thanks for the honour done them— (cheers).

The Mayor next proposed the Army and Navy. The sister services were fighting for our hearths and homes in a foreign land, and not only for our hearths and homes but for the hearths of those who were not sufficiently strong to act against the powerful aggressor— (cheers) ; and it would be seen that they would act with that daring and bravery which had ever distinguished the British soldier and sailor— (cheers). It was not only for the liberty of a foreign nation they were fighting, but for a nation at home, in order that we may live in that peace and prosperity which we had so long enjoyed. He would couple with the toast the names of his distinguished visitors, General Lord Downes for the Army and Captain Crazier for the Navy—(cheers).

Lord Downes, in the name of the Army in which he had the honour of serving, desired to return their thanks. The Army had almost been in a dormant state for some long time, but we might probably now hear of their success under the excellent management of Lord Raglan, and he trusted that the prayers of those who assembled within the church that day would be for the success of our gallant army—(cheers).

Captain Crozier, R.N. said, as the senior officer of the Navy present, he returned thanks for the manner the Mayor had proposed the toast and for the flattering reception it had met at their hands. He felt confident that wherever the servicea of the Navy, as well as of the sister service, might be called for, they would zealously and gallantly do their duty— (Cheers). He once more returned, on behalf of the service, his sincere and heartfelt thanks— (cheers).

The Lord Bishop of Winchester felt that he had already too long delayed in proposing a token of respect to the Mayor and Corporation of the town which they so well deserved. In assembling his friends around that table, the Mayor had conferred upon all of them a deep obligation, as he looked upon these opportunities of meeting each other with peculiar interest; it afforded him the opportunity of meeting those whom he could not at all times be amongst— not only the sister services of the country but those who were more closely allied with him, and who now all united together and took the opportunity of assembling round the social board in the interchange of kindly feeling and intercourse with each other— (cheers). He spoke the feelings of the clergy of the Island, and might he not hope those of the laity of the Island as well, and he would call upon all to join with him in drinking the health of the Mayor of the borough and of the Corporation of which he filled so worthily the chief office— (cheers).

The Mayor said it was certainly, and must be, a memorable day they had passed through, in the records of the borough. The Prince Albert had honoured them with his presence, as well as their lordships, the Lord Bishop of Winchester and Lord Downes; but they had witnessed a circumstance of far greater consequence —they had laid the foundation of an edifice to be erected for the service of the Almighty— (hear, hear), a building which would not only be useful to them, but for generations yet to come— (cheers). They had watched that dear and time-worn building— they had looked at it with feelings of the deepest veneration —in it their forefathers had offered up their praises and their prayers— and he and others could have wished it might be renovated and preserved ; but on mature consideration they felt that the building had become in too dilapidated a condition, that age had worked its way, and after a lapse of time they had applied to the task of re-building the church. They never could forget the zealous efforts of one who could not be present with them but whose heart's feelings were still with them, the Rev. Joseph Maude —(cheers). To his exertions they owed very much, and they regretted deeply his absence, but his place in their labours had bean zealously filled by the reverend gentleman who succeeded him. The Rev. G. H. Connor—(cheers) ; and through their united efforts they had found that, after removing their old building, they had raised sufficient to carry up the body of the church, and trusted that when that time arrived the Providence which had enabled them to raise between £7000 and £8000, would still smile upon them, that they might see the building carried out as it was shown upon their design, that they might see the tower as well as the body of the church erected— (cheers). The Lord Bishop of Winchester had kindly contributed, many gentlemen around the table had done the same, they had embarked in the work entrusted to them, and God grant they might have the strength and assistance to carry it out— (cheers). He saw many Aldermen snd Councillors around who could speak for themselves; but for himseld and on behalf of the Corporation, he returned most grateful thanks— (cheers).

Mr. Alderman Estcourt, after a pause, said as he had been waiting for the senior members of the Corporation to return thanks, he had hesitated to rise. He never, until that day, thoroughly appreciated the honour of belonging to the Corporation, by whose combined action had been gathered such an honourable assembly on that occasion. He returned thanks on behalf of himself and the other members of the Corporation— (cheers).

The Mayor said the next toast was one respecting which he felt some diffidence in approaching. It was the health of the Provincial Grand Master, who had left the room to join in the duties of his lodge, and the Masonic brethren—(cheers). Although these gentlemen kept many things in the dark, some would shine forth ; they could see that the brethren visited the fatherless and the widow, relieved the distressed, and came forth in any work whioch had for its ends the benefit of mankind, and they might therefore conclude that their principles and motives prung from the purest source— (cheers). He was honoured by their presence and thanked them for their attendance. He gave them the toast of the Masonic brethren, coupling it with the name of Brother Waterworth-(cbeers).

Mr. Waterworth acknowledged the toast, and said thatalthough there were many good men in the town who were not Masons, there could not exist a Mason who was not a good man (hear, hear, and cheers). He concluded by returning thanks for the Masonic craft.

Mr. W. B. Mew also acknowledged the compliment.

The Mayor said with the next toast he had really arrived at the foundation. They looked around and thought of the men who had originated the work, and, with the exception of those who had been called to their fathers, had steadily persevered in it up to the present time, those gentlemen being the Church Building Committee— (cheers). In the first place there was a strong feeling that the church should be renovated, but this being found impossible, they then set themselves to the work of erecting a new building, and they pledged themselves, collecting subscriptions from year to year, to commence the building within a period of five years. They had to fight a great battle to get together their funds, and had carried out their intention at the expiration of the fifth year of their labours— (cheers). There was one gemntleman whose exertions had been most strenuous, who had given them sound advice, and had been constant in his attendance on the committee: the Rural Dean was known throughout the length and breadth of the Island—(cheers), hiskindness and condescension were proverbial, and they had much thank him for that the church was commenced that day He called upon them to drink the health of the Rev. E. M'All and the Church Building Committee —(cheers).

The Rev. E. M'All * could not express the gratitude he felt at the high consummation at which they had arrived that day, a consummation which would give to the town of Newport, and to the whole of the Isle of Wight,  a church worth of its metropolis— (cheers).

The Mayor said the next health was that of the Rev. E. D. Scott, the Vicar of Cariabrooke, whose desire at all times was do that which would prove of advantage to them, and add to their general contentment here and happiness hereafter. The gentleman would make a most important announcement but before doing so they would have the gratification of drinking his health — (great cheering ).

The Rev. E. D. Scott returned thanks for the compliment, and added it would ill become him on a day like that to delay them but he would simply say that he would consent, with all his heart, to a separation of Newport from the Vicarage of Carisbrooke— (enthusiastic cheering).
 
The Rev. Bursar of Queen's College, Oxford, said an application had been made to them that they should forward the separation of Newport from the united parishes of Carisbrooke and Northwood, and appropriate a portion of the great tithes toward its endowment, and that proposition they had unhesitatingly accepted— (loud cheers), and, acting upon the advice of the Lord Bishop of the diocese, they had resolved that means shoukld be taken towards erecting Newport to a separate parish— (cheers).
 
The Mayor rose to propose the health of the Rev. Mr Connor, minister of St. Thomas's, who came amongst them when bereft of a pastor whom they all knew and esteemed, had to put his shoulder to the wheel, and had to work hard in the good cause in which they were embarked— (cheers).

The Rev. Mr. Connor, in returning thanks, said his own poor efforts would fall very far short of success, were they not aided by his reverend brethren, especially the Rev. Arthur Pennington whom he must thank for his kindness and support in all matters connected with the parish— (cheers).
 
The Mayor then proposed the health of the Rev. Arthur Pennington.
 
The Rev. Mr. Pennington said his desire and endeavour was to labour with Mr. Connor in promoting the spiritual interests of the town, and so long as he was spared his endeavour should be to promote its spiritual and its everlasting welfare— (cheers).
 
The Mayor proposed the health of Colonel Delacombe, of the Royal Marines, with thanks for the use of the band.

Colonel Delacombe suitably responded to the toast.

Lord Downes gave the health of the Ladies who had worked for the bazaar.
 
Mr. E. Way proposed the health of the Rev. Bursar of Queen's College, Oxford.
 
The Rev. Bursar, in acknowledging the compliment, said although the proposition made by Newport was received favourably by the College, it could not have been carried out for an indefinite time but for the Vicar, the Rev. Mr. Scott, who had very kindly and liberally brongbt the matter on to its present position, and thus enabled the College to carry out the wish of the inhabitants of Newport, with whom they very kindly sympathised —(loud cheers).
 
The Mayor proposed the Vice-Presidents, Messrs. Eldridge (Town Clerk), W. Way, and Jewell.
 
The Town Clerk acknowledged the toast.

Mr. J. Wyatt, of Oxford, responded to the toast of the Ladies.

The Mayor expressed his gratitude to the military authorities at Parkhurst for their co-operation at all times with the civic power, and gave the health of Colonel Rumley and the officers of Parkhurst Barracks— (cheers).

Colonel Rumley responded, after which the health of Captain Scott and the Isle of Wight Artillery Militia was given and responded to.

The Royal Marines band, which played an appropriate selection of music in the intervals between the toasts then performed the National Anthem, and the company separated.

It is worthy of remark that during the whole of the day's ceremonies the large mass of people that crammed the town behaved with the utmost decorum, and no accident of any kind happened.

## Local bye-laws

In the 1850s, disorderly conduct in the public streets had been regulated by the [Vagrancy Act, 1824](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1824/83/pdfs/ukpga_18240083_en.pdf), which included the following clause:

> ... every Common Prostitute wandering in the public Streets or public Highways, or in any Place of public Resort, and behaving in a riotous or indecent Manner;  ... , shall be deemed an idle and disorderly Person within the true Intent and Meaning of this Act.

https://www.oldscottish.com/statutes-c.html

The Contagious Diseases Acts were introduced in the 1860s for the compulsory examination of women believed to be common prostitutes for their hospitalisation (known as lock hospitals or lock wards) should they be diagnosed suffering from a contagious disease within the meaning of the Acts. The Acts were in reaction to fears that service men were vulnerable to infection from associating with prostitutes and that the Acts would apply to garrison towns and naval ports frequented by prostitutes. The Act of 1864 (27 and 28 Victoria C85) identified the following towns falling within the remit of the Act: Chatham, Colchester, Cork, Curragh, Portsmouth, Plymouth, Shorncliffe, Woolwich. The Act of 1866 (29 and 30 Victoria C96) added Canterbury, Devonport, Dover, Gravesend, Maidstone, Southampton and Winchester. The Act of 1873 did not stipulate particular towns or areas.

At the Petty Sessions, on Saturday last, before the County Magistrates, at the Guildhall.

— The Colonel of the St. Helens Regiment, together with Capt. Woolcombe, the Governor of the Juvenile Prison, appeared in court to complain of the great number of disorderly females which infested the road leading to the Barracks, aud were constantly lying-in-wait around the Barnet-gate, drawing away the attention of the men from their military duty, and occasioning very great inconvenience to the and moreover had been the means of sending many of the soldiers to the Hospital. The Court promised to consider what steps they could take to abate the evil; but it is well known that many of these wretched women —children, we had almost said—had followed the regiment from Winchester and Gosport, and the consequent evils were to be attributed to them. There is, however, a much greater evil existing within the Barrack-palings, and which calls aloud for a remedy. We have no doubt of the justice of the complaint laid by the Colonel of the indecent conduct exhibited without the gate ; but is it not a sin against all morals and decency to eject these miserable unfortunates at all times of the night, when caught within the precincts of the soldiers' quarters, to drive them from the gates to find the best of their way to the town without an article of clothing to cover them. Many of these poor creatures have been met by workmen in the mornings crawling along under the hedges and bye-roads in a state of nudity. Surely a remedy may be found without resorting to this indecent and immoral system to put a stop to the intrusion of improper character into the Garrison.

Isle of Wight Observer - Saturday 17 September 1853

HURRAH FOR THE WELSH FUSILIERS !

On Tuesday last the officers of the 23rd Royal Welsh Fusiliers gave a grand entertainment at the Queen's Rooms, Newport, which was brilliantly attended. The rooms were decorated with consummate taste, and presented a very gay and elegant tromp d'oeil. On the walls were pourtrayed animals of various kinds, around which gracefully depended festoons and bouquets; and from the side windows, avenues filled with choice exotic and native plants branched off, presenting charming perspective. Rarely, indeed, have we witnessed a more delightful reunion. Dancing commenced at ten o'clock to the music of the excellent Ryde Quadrille band, and alternately with that of the regiment, under the able superintendence of Mr. Handley. Quadrille, polka, valse, and galop followed each other rapid succession, and were kept till an advanced hour in the morning, giving ample occupation to the votaries of Terpsichore; the gay uniforms of the officers contrasting with the sober dress of the civilian, and intermingling with the beautiful costumes of "thefairest of the fair, presented scene charming in the extreme. At 12, the supper room, magnificently adorned with a profusion of plate and vases of flowers, and provided with the most luxuriant viands in the greatest profusion for the assembled guests, which reflected much credit upon the caterer, Mr. Jelly, the messman of the regiment, was thrown open.

The ball was most appropriately wound up with that Old English dance " Sir Roger de Coverley," with a rapid galop as *finale*.

The cordial *empressement* and affable hospitality of the gallant Fusiliers won all hearts, rendering every one who had the good fortune to be present happy and delighted. The most cynical could not refuse their full meed of approbation to their successful exertions in diffusing pleasure and amusement throughout the evening. For many years a more brilliant gathering has not been seen in Newport, and we most sincerely congratulate the Royal " Goats" on their signal success.

... [A list of the notable persons who attended is prodvided.]

---

As a garrison town, soldiers from a wide variety of regiments were stationed at Parkhurst Barracks, often *en route* to the Crimea via troop ships sailing out of Portsmouth. The muster appears to have reached about 1,300 officers and men at any one time, many of them young men in their teens or early twenties.

The military depots at Parkhurst Barracks, in the Isle of Wight, muster about 1,300 men and officers. A number of the men have volunteered recently into the Military Train, which is the name of a permanent corps that is to be a substitute for the Land Transport Corps. The military train is to number about 3,000, and the head-quarters is at Bristol. As soon as there is any large number of volunteers at Parkhurst they are sent under an escort to that city.

Reports occasionally appeared in the local press announcing the latest troop movements in and out of Parkhurst Barracks.

Owing to the severity of the weather, our poor would have fared badly had it not been for the liberality of the wealthy. As it is, coals, bread, and other comforts have been distributed among the necessitous, and an intimation given that whilst the cold continued the wants of the needy would not be forgotten nor disregarded.

During the week we have had fresh arrivals of recruits for Parkhurst Barracks, and several hundred soldiers of different regiments have left for Portsmouth *en route* for the Crimea, all of whom wore a cheerful countenance and did not appear at all depressed at leaving England; but on the contrary, they cheered lustily, and vowed they would give a good account oft the Russians if they should have the good luck to meet them.

Visitors continue to arrive daily in considerable numbers in the Isle of Wight, the coaches appear well laden, and carriages of all descriptions are again in motion ; lodgings are getting in request, and in Newport many are occupied by military officers and their families, in consequence of the quarters at Parkhurst not affording accommodation for the number. 

...

Large drafts of men and a considerable number of officers have lately left Parkhurst Barracks for the Crimea, who have been replaced by fresh arrivals, so that the Barracks are quite full at the present time. The Isle of Wight Militia Artillery, upwards of 100 strong, were under orders to be billetted at Ryde, so as to make room for the 48th Regiment in Newport, but the order was afterwards countermanded.
