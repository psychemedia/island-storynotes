# Tempters and Tempted

As 1855 ended, and 1856 began, work was proceeding well on the new church, if not on improving Newport's moral character.

The old year, with all its cares and sorrows, its clouds and tempests has passed. We stand on the threshold of a new, and we hope, a brighter and a better one. Newport has made but little improvement or progress, excepting its beautiful new church, now fast developing its elegant proportions and exquisite workmanship. It will be a structure worthy of the capital town of the Isle of Wight, and will reflect honour on the names and memories of those, by whose liberality, zeal, and perseverance, the great work will be accomplished.
```

In the early summer of the previous year, 1855, the [Saturday 30 June, 1855](https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000170/18550630/030/0004) edition of the *Isle of Wight Observer* records in its *Fashionable List* that the Rev. Carus Wilson, and his wife, Mrs Wilson, were in residence at Pulpit Rock Villa, Ventnor, Isle of Wight. A couple of months later, by [Saturday 11 August 1855](https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000170/18550811/022/0004),  it seems that they had moved on to St. Boniface House, Ventnor. (By August 1857, W. Carus Wilson was signing letters from Eglinton-house, Ventnor.)

William Carus Wilson was a retired evangelical Christian, the founder in 1823 of the Clergy Daughters' School, Cowan Bridge, on the Lancashire side of the Lancashire, Cumbria and West Riding of Yorkshire border. He had also founded, edited and regularly contributed to *The Children's Friend* magazine, launched in 1824, and was author of [Child's First Tales, Chiefly in Words of One Syllable, for the use of Infant Schools and Little Children in General (2 volumes?)](https://archive.org/details/McGillLibrary-rbsc_child-first-tales_61610677-21770/page/n3/mode/2up).

Presumably as a result of a perceived lack of response to the memorial to the Newport magistrates, Carus Wilson published a tract early in 1856 that appears to have been even more outspoken in its condemnation of the vices of Newport and the threats they posed to the morals of the young men stationed in Parkhurst Barracks.

Published by Thomas Butler, Bookseller, also of Ventnor, he pamphlet was entitled *Tempters and Tempted*, and seems to have been widely distributed around Newport.

```{warning}
*I have not yet tracked down a copy of this work, nor have I yet found any of its contents reproduced anywhere.*
```

Its contents were seemingly explosive, and provoked the Mayor of Newport, John Henry Hearn, Esq., to speak out about it at a council meeting of Tuesday, February 4th, 1856.

In the first place, he objected to the way in which the tract appeared to have been distributed, not least to members of his own family and some of the women who worked in his household:

[Isle of Wight Mercury - Saturday 09 February 1856](https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0001417/18560209/015/0005)

The Mayor rose, and said, that he should not be doing justice to his own feelings or to the town if he did not bring before the Council the gross insult which had been cast on them by the address, the Tempter and Tempted, written, it was said, by a gentleman lately come to reside there, the Rev. Carus Wilson, and it was with no ordinary feelings of indignation that he found the beastly tract had been taken to his house, and was in the hands of his family and female domestics; could any honest man, could any father of a family avoid feeling grieved that such gross accounts of vice should be brought to defile the minds of young persons? He was more astonished and indignant to find that copies had been delivered to the children at the Sunday schools, and the National schools. He hoped the British schools had escaped the pollution. He considered these females who distributed such a work and placed them in the hands of children a disgrace to their sex. He regretted that these meddling troublesome fellows who were interfering where they had no connection with the town, and he should have thought that Mr. Smith might have found other ditties for which he was paid by the Treasury, rather than interfering with the town of Newport.

```

The Mayor then declared that he felt it his duty to defend the town, and one of the other councillors asked what he might do about the exaggerated claims made against the town.

```{admonition} Falsehoods and calumnies
:class: dropdown

He felt it his duty to deny most clearly, and to protest most strongly against the falsehoods and calumnies which had been circulated respecting the Borough of Newport. He asserted firmly, and would prove his assertion that there were few more moral towns than Newport and no garrison town where there was so little debauchment. He could prove by official returns which he had obtained, that the health of the soldiers their general morality, while at Parkhurst, were much above the average. He could not have allowed the Council to have separated without throwing off the foul imputation, and pressing from his heart the indignation he felt at the insult that had been put on them, and the town.—Mr. W. B. Mew concurred in the sentiments and feelings expressed by the Mayor, and denounced the exaggerated statements about the town, which had been put forth.—Mr. Robert Pinnock congratulated the Council on the course taken by the Mayor, to revel the calumnies which had been indulged in thousands of the books, had been circulated, and unless contradicted, might cling to the town. He asked the Mayor whether he would take it up as the organ of the Council, & repudiate the calumnious attack on the town. Its origin could be traced to a new movement that had been organized in the memorial addressed to the Magistrates, and to a newspaper paragraph. He considered that the sooner such proceedings were discouraged the better.—Mr. Pring said the memorial had been handed to the Watch Committee, of which he was one, and after the strictest investigation, they came to an unanimous vote, that there was no cause to interfere with the general arrangements. He had lately been in most of the towns in the kingdom where the military were near, and he said with confidence, that Newport for order, quietness and morality, surpassed all the others. Some persons were over nice, and he thought the Town Clerk might as will stay at home, as to go about interfering with others

```

At this point, it seems as if one of the council members made a claim regarding regular reports made by the Town Missionary, Mr. Tucker, to the Town CLerk (Mr. Eldridge) which he passed on to the Magistrates.

```{admonition} Secret reports
:class: dropdown

.—Mr. Eldridge (Town Clerk), said he was one of those who agreed with the memorial; he thought it was quite right, and no censure ought to be cast on those who were parties to it. The attention of the Magistrates was called to facts which were patent to all Gentlemen, and if those present had seen the report of the Town Missionary, which Dr. Wavell and himself had presented to them weekly, they would know the amount of vice which prevailed.—The Mayor said they had no right to sit in judgment upon others, they had no authority to judge and collect accusations against their neighbours. If this was the occupation of a Town Missionary, the sooner he was removed the better.—Mr. Eldridge said he knew that he had lifted up many who had been cast down, and he could tell of those in higher places, whose conduct would not bear investigation.—Mr. Pinnock said that the missionary was engaged to raise up the frail, but the course pursued by him and his employers, had turned out a curse to the town.—Mr. Wilkins and Mr. Morgan expressed similar feelings with the other members of the Council.—Mr. W. B. Mew wished to know by what authority these men had set up this court of inquisition; he felt indignant at their presumption.
```

A reference was also made to a publication in previous years that also seems to have engaged in spreading "unpleasntness". 

```{admonition} The "Paul Pry" newspaper
:class: dropdown
There was a newspaper once circulated in the town, called Paul Pry, which was very objectionable, and caused unpleasantness in many families but this was much worse, as the scandal was handed from one to the other, without the knowledge of the person whose reputation was attacked. If this Paul Pry defended by Mr. Eldridge, went into these abodes of sin and temptation, he ought to be exceedingly good; as pitch could not be handled without defilement. The exposure that day should induce the Town Clerk to cut such acquaintance, and he could not help feeling disgusted that men should be found, who could listen to the reports, full of scandals and libels on their neighbours.—The Mayor said he was afraid there was a great deal too much of spying and prying going on.
```

```{admonition} A response to Carus Wilson is called for
:class: dropdown

After a long conversation, it was determined that it should be left to the Mayor either to write in his own name to the Rev. Carus Wilson or in that of the Council contradicting his statements, as embodied in the address "Tempters and Tempted." Since the meeting of the Town Council and the exposure of the system of espionage which has been carried on in Newport, principally by the means of the town missionary, Mr. Tucker, several subscribers have determined to have their names struck as they never contemplated that they were paying their money to gratify the curiosity of individuals, or to rake up scandal against their neighbours.
```

Another report of the same meeting seemed to lay the authorship of the tract at the feet of two people, the Revd. Henry Smith, as well as Carus Wilson.

NEWPORT, Saturday, February 9.

Town Council Meeting

The quarterly meeting of the Newport Town Council took place on Tuesday.

...

The Reported Immoral State of the Inhabitants of Newport

The Worshipful the Mayor rose and said, there was one painful matter affecting the interests of the town which he considered it his duty, as their chief Magistrate, to bring before the Council. His feelings had been lately shocked on finding that a disgusting pamphlet, entitled, "Tempters and Tempted," had been industriously circulated about the town, and by one means and the other had found its way into almost every house ; and he was sure he was sharing the feelings of every, rightminded head of a household, when he said that such vile slander against their town as was therein contained ought to be emphatically and publicly protested against— (hear, hear). He could not express the indignation he felt on learning its contents, and finding that everyone in his house, excepting his wife, had read its contaminating pages; and greatly astonished was he to find that those tracts had been placed in the hands of the children of their Church Sunday and other schools by females— he would not say by ladies. He would ask if expressions such as these— "Your town is on fire with the flames of licentiousness and lust" — were fit for the minds of tender children to dwell upon? And were they not a gross insult, and a libel on the inhabitants of the town ? And by whom was this shameful tract written? Not by one of the pastors or ministers of the town, but by a non-resident, who had nothing whatever to do with the town, assisted by another meddling, troublesome busybody, who, he should think, would be far better employed in his business at the Prison at Parkhurst. The parties to the tract were Carus Wilson and Henry Smith; that was an undisguised fact, and the stigma with which the town had been branded would doubtless be most pernicious to the interests of it ; and he did say they (the Corporation) ought to do all in their power to destroy its baneful influence. The assertions in it respecting the general depravity and debauchery of our town were infamously false.
```

In a report a week later, it seems that the Revd, Henry Smith was not so keen to be recognised as sharing responsibility for the tract.

The Meeting of last week and the Tabooed Tract.—

We abide by the resolution announced in our last publication, not to mix ourselves up in the squabble respecting the charge against the morality of the town and district of Newport. We have received a long letter from the Rev. Henry Smith, who complains that his name was unwarrantably used at the meeting, and that, in consequence, he has been held up to much ridicule. We do not see that the publication of what seems to him to be a satisfactory explanation of the matter can help him in the slightest degree. He somewhat indignantly denies that he was a party either to writing or publishing the tract, but admits that a female friend of his is not so innocent in this respect as himself, and he feels bound to "uphold her in any work of Christian philanthropy she may choose to undertake, rather than spend her time in idleness and gossip." The author of another letter, signed " Justitia," will also find in the terms of this paragraph a reason for the respectful rejection of his comments.

In passing, I note that it was another Henry Smith, a certain *Captain* Henry Smith, who collected the story of [The Three Little Pigs](../three-little-pigs.md) in Shanklin around 1853.

```

Back in the earlier council report, a stout defence of Newport not being as bad as other garrison towns was also reported.

```{admonition} Less average disease than elsewhere
:class: dropdown

There was not a garrison town in England that was so free from the charge as Newport— (hear, hear), and he had it from undoubted authority that there had always been less average disease in the Garrison at Parkhurst than at any other, arising from such vicious habits as are imputed to our town. He would, therefore, once again say, that these infamous and unfounded assertions respecting their borough ought to be thus publicly denounced— (hear, hear).


In this report, a Mr. Pinnock lays a charge against certain members of the magistracy that they already new how bad things were.

```{admonition} The shocking state of morals was no surprise
:class: dropdown

Mr. Pinnock said he was proud their Chief Magistrate had shown the moral courage thus to speak out against a matter which ciations than the Mayor had, and desire him to take such further was calculated to be a most serious injury to the town, if not thus publicly disclaimed. And they ought to go further in their denun- steps as be might deem expedient to stop the thing— (hear). For such a false and shocking report of the state of morals of the inhabitants of Newport was unjust to the Magistracy of the Borough, and he regretted to be obliged to further state that some of the members of their Council had been, in a measure, parties to it. They first had their attention drawn to the immoral state of the town by their Town Clerk, some of the ministers of religion, and other parties living in the town, waiting on the Magistrates, at the Town Hall, as a deputation, requesting them to lend their influence, in their public capacity, to suppress vice and immorality in the town; then there were paragraphs in the newspapers on the subject; and at last there were found religious fanatics ready to make a handle of those pharisaical " good intentions," and scandal was the consequence, which if not met in some such way as this, the town was likely to suffer most seriously. He had some knowledge of other military towns, and it was with thankfulness he felt that Newport was a paradise in comparison with any of them.

Mr. W. B. Mew fully coincided in the censures which had been passed on the authors and circulators of this most injudicious and injurious tract.
```

A Mr. Pring is also reported as making some suggestions regarding the possible policing strategy, and the risks associated with taking too hard a line, as well as comparing Newport favourably with other garrison and naval towns.

```{admonition} Generally speaking
:class: dropdown

Mr. Pring considered at the time that the said deputation took upon themselves to wait upon the Council and lecture them upon the immoral state of the town, that they were going somewhat out of their way, and could not help thinking that their worthy Town Clerk, who headed that deputation, would have been better employed in his office. However, they thought perhaps there were some matters which might be rectified, and instructed their police to be watchful and keep the streets clear, and people moving; and their inspector had shown that generally speaking there was no necessity for interference except on Sundays, and then it was a delicate matter, as people stood about talking with each other after coming out of the various places of worship. Well, the police, in the execution of their duty, civilly requested a group, who were thus standing together in the High-street, to " move on," and they turned out to be a tradesman's family, who had since been to them complaining of the impertinence of the police in this respect. He had opportunities of being acquainted with the state of other military towns, and he could say with Mr. Pinnock, that Newport was not to be compared with any of them. Take Portsmouth, Winchester, Chatham, or even the fashionable town of Southampton, and immorality exhibited itself in a much greater degree in those towns than in Newport— (hear).
```

At this point, an explosive revelation appeared to have been made regarding the "secret reports" from the Town Missionary, and the implication that members of the council or the magistracy might themselves be indulging in liaisons with some of the lower classes of female company,

```{admonition} The shocking state of morals was no surprise
:class: dropdown
The Town Clerk (Mr. Eldridge) replied, that as far as the memorial which had been spoken of went, he believed he and the other parties connected with that movement had acted with perfect consistency, and had done nothing in it but what was proper. Their attention had been drawn to the retrograding state of the public morals of Newport, and they were anxious to use every exertion legally to stem the growing depravity of the town— which was patent to all. With respect to the tract in question, he had read it, and thought it a very injudicious publication, and feeling this, when their town missionary spoke to him respecting some which he had for circulation, he told him it would be unwise to do so, and that he had best not have anything to do with it. But, nevertheless, he thought the less said about the matter the better. He and Dr. Wavell had the weekly inspection of the Town Missionary's report book, and they unhappily knew that many moving in the higher ranks of life were guilty of fostering the immorality of the town by their own immoral conduct —(great excitement, and cries of "Order" from both sides of the Chamber).

The Chairman must call Mr. Eldridge to order. Such Observations were in very bad taste and most improper, and they could not be heard sitting there in judgment on their fellow-townsmen ; and he was surprised and vexed to learn that such a spy system had been adopted of diving into matters of privacy, for the purpose of getting up a Quixotic crusade against an evil which, by parties thus acting with such indiscreet religious zeal, would be the very means of increasing the evils they would wish to suppress. The utmost they could do was to put down dancing- houses and brothels, prevent broils and lewd and improper conduct in the streets, and keep public-houses as orderly as possible. Beyond this they could not go— (hear).

Mr. Pring to Mr. Eldridge— And by what means and authority do you and Dr. Wavell get the regular inspection of this Town Missionary's Report-book?

Mr. Pinnock— And if this is his mission, the sooner he is out of the town the better. Such a man is a curse to the town !

Mr. Eldridge— Not a curse. A blessing, I hope. His book is strictly private. No one but Dr. Wavell and myself, who sign it weekly, see the book.

Mr. Morris Morgan— It has been said that the Town Missionary had been told not to circulate the tract ; but he had reasons for believing that he did distributed them, and he had been informed that he had also given certain information to Carus Wilson on the subject— (exclamations of "Oh !")

Mr. Mew was astounded at what had been elicited during this discussion, and expressed himself in the most severe terms of disapprobation at the idea of some of the authorities of the town being so mixed up with such a disreputable matter— and they, too, professing themselves to be Christians ! Such conduct was scandalous and abominable, and was only second in infamy to the Paul Pry newspaper espionage that was some years ago the medium of so much scandal and abuse, and had such a baneful effect on society. He thought if Mr. Eldridge felt rightly on the matter, he would at once cut the acquaintance of this Town Missionary, at least.

After some further stormy observations— many of the Council joining in the discussion—it was agreed that the Mayor should take what steps he might consider necessary as a still further disclaimer to the false and injurious reports which had been so industriously circulated concerning the reputation of their borough ; and the Council broke up with anything but delighted feelings.

```

A third report of the meeting covers much the same ground as the previous two.

MEETING OF THE NEWPORT TOWN COUNCIL.

The Quarterly Meeting of the Town Council was held on Tuesday, the Mayor, John Henry Hearn, Esq., in the chair.

...

The Mayor— I should not do justice to my own feelings or my duty to the town, if I were not to bring, before this Council the insult which had been offered by the publication of the "Tempters and Tempted." It was with no ordinary feelings of indignation that I found the beastly tract had been thrust into my house, and copies were in the hands of my family and female servants. I was still more astonished to find that they had been delivered to the children of the Sunday and National Schools; the British Schools I hope escaped the pollution ; and for such books to be placed in the hands of children by females I consider it a disgrace to their sex. There were meddling, troublesome fellows who interfered where they had no right, having no connection with the town. I should think that Mr. Smith could find plenty of duties at Parkhurst Prison, for which he is paid by the Treasury, instead of mixing himself up in these transactions. There was no doubt it was the work of a Mr. Wilson, a gentleman who had taken up a temporary residence in the Island, but a good deal of it must have been supplied by others. I again deny the accusation, and protest against the slander. With so many soldiers in the neighbourhood, perfection could not be expected ; but with perfect confidence I assert that in no garrison town in the kingdom was there so little debauchery ; and from information he had obtained from an official quarter, the health and morals of the troops at Parkhurst were above the average of other places. I cannot help expressing to this Council the strong feelings I entertain at the foul indignity that has been put on us as a town.

Mr. Pinnock congratulated the Council on the bold manner in which the Mayor had met the foul accusation, which had been circulated ; and which, uncontradicted, might prove an injury to the town. Thousands of copies had been issued, and he had heard that more were to be sent abroad. He traced the scandal to the new movement that had been organised in Newport, to the committee and memorial afterwards published in the newspapers, and considered it the duty of all to discourage such proceedings.

Mr. Pring, as one of the Watch Committee, said, the memorial had been handed to them, and its contents discussed, and they came to an unanimous vote that there it was no just ground for interference. He had travelled much, seen many places where soldiers were near, and fearlessly affirmed that a quieter or better conducted town was not to be found in the kingdom. Some persons were over nice and expected perfection, and he thought it would be quite as well if their Town Clerk were to stay at home as go about interfering with others.

Mr Eldridge (Town Clerk), rose and said, he was one of those who agreed with the memorial ; the memorialists did not intend it as a censure, but called the attention of the magistrates to a fact patent to all. He had nothing to do with the "Tempters and Tempted," but if gentlemen had seen the lists brought to him and Dr. Wavell weekly, they would be astonished at the amount of crime and the persons committing it; he could name some of the higher classes.— (Great sensation.)

The Mayor said they had no right to sit in judgement on their neighbours ; such conduct was indecent, and he held those who stirred in such things as exceeding their duty. Persons slandered had not the ordinary means of defence, and if that was the office of the missionary it was using it for evil.

Mr. Eldridge said the missionary had raised up many bowed down with sin.

Mr. Pinnock thought if the missionary was engaged to raise up the frail it was not intended that he should be a spy ; it would be found that he was a curse to the town.

Mr. Wilkins and Mr. Morgan expressed opinions in unison with the other members of the Council.

Mr. W. B. Mew would like to know by what authority Dr. Wavell and Mr. Eldridge set themselves up as inquisitors on others ; such conduct raised the indignation of every one worthy the name of man. This missionary was worse than the Paul Pry Newspaper; there you could find out what was said, but this was a private inquisitor. How he could go amongst such vice as he described without contamination he could not think, for it was difficult to handle pitch without being defiled. He was surprised at the Town Clerk ; he would advise him to break off such acquaintance as early as possible.

After a desultory conversation it was agreed that the Mayor be empowered to write to the Rev. Carus Wilson, either in his own name or that of the Council, repudiating the description he had given of the Town of Newport in his tract, "The Tempters and Tempted."
```

The outcome of the council meeting was that the Mayor should write to the author of the *Tempters and Tempted* tract, the Revd. Carus Wilson, repudiating the claims made against Newport in that tract.

```{warning}
I still haven't found a copy of the Mayor's letter, or a copy of its contents, from the mayor to Carus Wilison,  but it seems that it provoked a rapid, and very public, reponse from the Rev. Carus Wilson in the form of another tract.

From a debate a week later on the question of maintaining the Sabbath and the appeals of the "Sunday League" party, ripples from some of the accusations that appeared to have been made in the previous Council meeting still seemed to be playing out.

Mr. Robert Pinnock ... Their Chairman had referred to Mr. Eldridge's mayoralty, to which he wished to add a rider. On the occasion of one of his Corporation processions to Church, a poor man who had been walking from the country on that very Sunday, and was dry and dusty, procured half-a-pint of beer from a neighbour of his, who kept the Crispin public-house in the town, at a forbidden time of the day according to the law, which had just then been altered in it a opening and closing regulations; and the next day the landlord was brought before Mr. Eldridge and other magistrates and fined 7s 6d for this grave offence, although he pleaded that he was not aware of the alteration of the law in question— (uproar); bui the Mayor and his party could retire to his house and drink their wine and enjoy the repast spread for them on that day, and yet be held blameless— (cries of "shame!") He merely mentioned the fact by contrast, to show how the law oftener bears down on the poor man than on the rich.

...

A hustling was now observed in the crowd, and it was announced amidst much confusion that some gentleman wished to reply to some of Mr. Pinnock's observations.

The Chairman— "Come forward, Mr. Mollett, we will hear what you bave to s ay, or any oiher gentleman of the company."

W. Mollett, Esq. then got upon the platform, amidst an indescribable volley of hooting, jeering, cheering, and whistling, and observed, the words he had to say did not refer to the special object of the meeting. Mr. Pinnock had said— "The objects of their Town Mission had been abused by the parties connected with it turning it into an institution for spy purposes"— (renewed uproar. Mr. Pinnock explaining that what he said was, "These gentlemen may have turned a Town Mission into an association for the purposes of scandal").

The Chairman then recounted the scene which took place in the Council Chamber a few days ago, respecting the tract "Tempters and Tempted." when matters came out respecting a book kept by the Town Missionary and inspected weekly by Mr. Eldridge and Mr. Wavell, which led some of ;he Council to say that if such was the object of the Town Mission, it would prove a curse, and not a blessing.

Mr. Mollett here attempted to explain that this was not the object of that institution, hut that it was founded entirely on the principles of the London City Missions. What Mr. Eldridge had told the Council respecting the immorality of some of the higher classes, was from his own knowledge, and not from that book. He was, however, stopped by Mr. Pring, and the cries of " Turn him out," and so forth, were so vociferous, that Mr. Mollett descended from the platform.

```

From the Petty Sessions of Monday, February 25th, 1856, we get the sense that some people at least considered Carus Wilson's response to the Mayor to be libellous and had jumped the gun in taking steps to prevent its distribution.

At the Borough Petty Sessions, on Monday, before the Mayor, Thomas Cooke, and Edward Way, Esqrs.

James Lewis, who had been taken into custody on Saturday evening, but liberated on his own recognizance, for whom Mr. G. P. Joyce appeared, was told there was no charge against him. It appeared that in consequence of a caution signed by Mr. Eldridge, Town Clerk, that the pamphlet containing a letter of the Rev. Carus Wilson, in answer to the Mayer of Newport, was a libel, the defendant was taken into custody for selling the book. Mr. Joyce Wished to know by what authority his client had been taken into custody, and also whether the books would be returned. The Mayor said there was no charge made against James Lewis, and he must apply to the Inspector of Police respecting the books.
