<p>BOROUGH PETTY SESSIONS. (Monday. Dec. 29.—Before Edward Way, and j. H. Hearn, Esqrs.)</p>
<p>Female Debauchery.</p>
<p>A woman named Elizabeth Jackman, a prostitute, was brought up in custody, charged with being drunk in the public streets at midnight, on the previous Friday. The case was proved by PC. Stubbs, who stated that on Friday night, about half-past 12 o’clock, he saw the defendant in Paradise-row, and also in Pyle-street, in a state of intoxication. He desired her to go to her home, which was situate in Paradise-row, but she requested that she might be locked up. He again repeated the salutary advice to go home, but, after walking down Pyle-street, she returned to the officer a second time, and in accordance with her request, locked her up in the station-house.</p>
<p>The girl expressed contrition for her conduct, and, after duly admonishing her, the bench ordered her to be discharged.</p>
</div>
<p>The following tale amusingly tells of how one visitor to the Tontine Tap had his lunch stolen.</p>

<p>BOROUGH PETTY SESSIONS. [Monday.— Before R. M. Wavell, and E. Scott, Esqrs.]</p>
<p>Felony.— Sarah Duffy, a woman of low character and depraved habits, was charged with stealing a piece of pork, of the value of two shillings and five pence, the property of William Lane, a labouring man residing at Arreton. It appears that the silly fellow had been drinking with the prisoner the “Tontine Tap” till midnight on Saturday last, and had with him a basket provisions for home, including a choice bit of pork for Sunday’s dinner. When the tap was closed and they could get no more beer, he went with the fascinating Mistress Duffy—whose blandishments and charms he could not resist—to her house up the Tontine yard, and she had not much difficulty in persuading him to go back and try to get a pint of beer, and whilst he was gone she opened the lid of his basket, looked at the pork, approved both quantity and quality, and so took it to herself. When the unsuspecting William returned, both she and the pork were gone. He shouted at the foot of the stairs, but nobody answered, and so he went and informed the police; and the next day, P.C. Stubbs, in presence of Superintendent Stubbs, found the identical piece of pork concealed in her bed. Committed to one month’s hard labour.</p>

<p class="admonition-title">Stealing his Sunday’s dinner, March 1857</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000069/18570321/009/0004">Hampshire Telegraph - Saturday 21 March 1857</a></p>
<p>At the Borough Court, on Monday, before R. H. Wavell, J. Hearn, and E. Way, Esqrs, Wm. Lane, a countryman, charged Sarah Duffy, residing in Tontine Yard, with stealing his Sunday’s dinner. It appeared that after he had been drinking with the prisoner for some hours at the Tontine tap, he accompanied her home, where his basket was speedily eased of its contents of bread and pork, whilst he was gone after more beer. Prisoner pleaded guilty— 28 days to hard labour.</p>
</div>
<p>Did Sarah Duffy also have a sister, perhaps, Emma Duffey, who had also appeared before the Court for disorderly conduct near the Barrack gate in June 1856?</p>

<p>DISORDERLY CHARACTER. Rosina Judicott, a prostitute, was charged with disorderly conduct.—P.C. George Tiley deposed that on the previous evening he was on duty on Node Hill, when saw the prisoner following three soldiers. They wished her to go away, but she refused to do so, at the same time making use of very abusive language. He told her to cease annoying the soldiers but she continued to follow them, he was obliged to take her the lock up. She was very drunk at the time.— Fined 5s. and 5s. costs, and in default the prisoner was committed to gaol for 21 days.</p>

<p>BOROUGH COURT. Monday— Magistrates present: The Mayor, R. M. Wavell, and E. Way, esqrs.</p>
<p>George Coward charged Henry Underwood with striking him several times on Sunday night last, in Crocker-street. It appears he and others were drinking, and there were several skirmishes, and complainant, who was the least to blame, got most of the blows. Defendant declared he did not strike him at all, but P.C. Limington swore he struck him in bis presence, and he was fined 15s, including costs, which he paid.</p>
<p>The defendant, Henry Underwood, was now charged with striking three prostitutes, named Elizabeth Jackman, Ann Duffey, and Sarah Cosier. It appeared Coward was with them, and this caused the ill-feeling. He was mulcted in another 15s, which he also paid.</p>

<p>Borough Court, Monday— Before the Mayor, R. M. Wavell and E. W;ty, Esqrs.</p>
<p>John Chick, a German, was charged with keeping a disorderly house and encouraging prostitution therein. P.C. Stubbs proved that on Sunday morning, the 6th inst., he went to the defendant’s beershop, in the High-street, about quarter-past one, when he found in the parlour three of the band of the Limerick Militia, a serjeant, and a civilian. In the passage he found another civilian, lying drunk on the floor with a common prostitute by his side. In one bed-room which the landlady unlocked he found two civilians and two prostitutes, in another bed-room one civilian and one prostitute, two civilians in another room, and another prostitute down stairs, most of whom were well supplied with beer. Defendant said he went to bed at eleven o’clock, and knew nothing about the matter. The Court said his conduct had been disgraceful, and they should fine him in the penalty of 3l. and costs, cautioning him that if he ever came there again he would not be let off so easily.</p>

<p>BOROUGH COURT. On Monday, before Dr. Wavell and E. Way, Rio.</p>
<p>“SHE WAS SITCH A SCREAMER! “</p>
<p>Caroline Pierce, Sarah Harvey, and Mary Ann Groundsell, three veiled young ladies, standing in class A 1 on the pave, were charged with being common disturbers of the peace.</p>
<p>P.C. Grey examined: Last Wednesday night, about a quarter to eleven, I was standing in front of the Market House, when I heard some disgraceful screeching and screaming in the Corn Market. I went in that direction, when I saw these women standing under the portico of the Newport Arms. One of them said, “ Here comes the policeman,” and then they turned about, and went in to the Newport Arms, and I went in and saw who they were. They were not sober, either of them, and there was no one else in the market, or in the house. They are common prostitutes.</p>
<p>Inspector Grapes examined: The inhabitants of the Corn Market are frequently making complaints of the nuisance created by these girls at late heurs, and one of them has been committed for it, but it is of uo use talking to them. These offences recur frequently, and on this occasion, you could hear their screams clear down to the Market House.</p>
<p>Defendants said they were not intoxicated, and that they never screamed. They were only enjoying a laugh together.</p>
<p>The Chairman : We are sorry to see young people brought before as on such disgraceful charges as these, and there is no doubt but you are frequently intoxicated. Your conduct is a nuisance to the town, and we shall now bind you over in the sum of £10 each, for your good behaviour for three months.</p>
<p>Defendants paid the fees of 5s. each, and were liberated, somewhat astonished at having escaped so easily, after having given the required bail.</p>
<p>Not so lucky.</p>
<p>Mary Ann Reed, Mary Ann Woodman, and Louisa Bannister, moving in class Z. 99, were charged with being drunk and disorderly in the public streets.</p>
<p>P.C. Tiley examined : On Thursday night about half past ten, I was on duty in St. James’s-street, when I saw these girls, with about fourteen soldiers, come out of the Lame Dog. They were beastly drunk, and they came up through the streets swearing and hallooing, and using the most disgraceful language. I should have locked them up then, but for so many soidlers. Bannister fell down several times from drunkenness. They are common prostitutes.</p>
<p>Defendants said they were not drunk, and they never said nothink to nobody.</p>
<p>The Chairman : It is a very sad thing to see young women giving way to such practices, endangering both body and soul, and as such we are determined to try and put an end to it, we commit you for one month each, to the house of correction.</p>
<p>Another still.</p>
<p>Sarah Baxen, the last of the batch, was next charged by P.C. Jolliffe with being drunk and disorderly on Tuesday night, when witness would have taken her into custody, but for the interference of several soldiers, who set him at defiance, and who took her off to the Anchor Brewery. Fined 10s., and in default of payment committed for a fortnight.</p>

<p>William Hall, aged 16, was charged with stealing a gold ring, the property of his mother.—Emma Head said she was the wife of John Head, but lived apart from her husband, and the prisoner was her son. Last November she was living at Barton’s Village, and missed her wedding ring from under a glass case on the mantel-piece. She had lost several other articles some time before. When she asked the prisoner about the ring, he said that he had not taken it. She had not seen it since then until Thursday last. The ring now produced was the same; it was marked “22 I.W.,” and was bought at a pawn-shop.—Mary Ann Cooper said she lived at the Orange Tree beershop, in Pyle-street, and knew Hall. In December last he came to the beershop with a gold ring on his little finger, and offered it for sale, but Mrs. James refused to buy it. He then put it into her hand, and asked her to give him some beer for it, and she gave him five pints. She wore it for some time, and afterwards pawned it, but took it out again, and wore it up to Thursday last, when she gave to P.C. Hunt. The prisoner pleaded guilty, and, having been previously convicted four times within two years, he was sentenced six months’ imprisonment, with hard labor.</p>

<p>ISLE OF WIGHT PETTY SESSIONS. BOROUGH COURT. Monday.— The borough magistrates in attendance were Mr. F. Pittis, Captain W. S. Graham, and Mr. F. Vulliamy.</p>
<p>Charges brought against the keeper of a refreshment house.— Mary Ann Tribbick, keeper of a small coffee-house in Town-lane, was charged by the police with harbouring prostitutes and other disorderly persons. Mr. H. R. Hooper appeared on behalf of the defendant. — Mr. Superintended Grapes said one of the constables called his attention to a noise in defendant’s house, about 1.15 a.m. on Sunday, the 3rd instant. He went and rapped at the door and, after waiting some little time was admitted. In a small back room he found eleven men and one woman, a common prostitute named Elkins. Nearly all of them were drunk, and some were lying on the floor. The woman Elkins lives close by the house. Was not aware that she went in occasionally to assist the defendant in her business.— Policeman Tiley corroborated the main facts in the preceding evidence. There were two or three men in the front room.— Mr. Hooper submitted that no case had been made out against defendant. There was only one woman present, and she a neighbour assisting in the business, therefore the charge or harbouring common prostitutes fell to the ground. It would be straining a point too far to convict his client upon such evidence.— Mr. Pittis, as chairman, said the bench would hear the second charge before deciding upon the first.—Police-man Tiley then gave evidence on the second charge of harbouring prostitutes. On the morning of Wednesday, the 6th instant, he was in search of a soldier who was absent from barracks without leave, and went to defendant’s house about noon. He was answered at the window by two prostitutes, who said they were locked in and could not open the door. Witness was satisfied that he had heard a man’s voice in the house. He then went through the adjoining premises, scaled a wall and entered the house by the back door. On searching the house he found a private of the 11th Regiment. The women, in answer to a question, said defendant went out and locked the door after her before they were up, and she had not returned. Witness was aware that defendant let beds.— Mr. Hooper said his instructions were that the women on Tuesday night went there for a bed and slept together. The soldier came in for a bed, after they had retired, and slept by himself in a room on another floor. If the police were making a raid on these houses, they had certainly brought forward two very weak cases. He felt satisfied that the bench would not convict.— The Chairman said it would be straining the law too tightly to convict; they should, therefore, dismiss the complaints.</p>

<p>Harriet Sheath, of Ryde, was charged with stealing a petticoat.— Mary Ann Tribbick, wife of George Tribbick, said: I live at the “ Tontine,” Newport. On the evening of the 26th of August the prisoner came to my house and asked for lodgings. She remained in the house until Thursday morning. On the evening of the same day I missed a petticoat, which I had seen in my bedroom on the morning before she left the house. She had taken it while I was absent getting milk. The petticoat produced is the one I lost. My maiden name is upon it.— Police-constable Tiley witnessed to taking the prisoner into custody. She said she had not stolen the petticoat, and that it might have been her sister. I then took her to Mrs. Tribbick, who said she was the person whom she suspected, and she was at last found wearing it.—The prisoner pleaded guilty, and was sentenced to 21 days’ imprisonment with hard labour in the Winchester House of Correction.- Caroline Jacobs was summoned for using abusive language towards Amelia Sheath.—The case was dismissed.</p>

A great many complaints had been made of several publicans opening their houses on a Sunday before the proper time, and the magistrates had resolved for the future to be more strict with such houses. William Woodford, of the “Valiant Soldier,” South-street, and Charles Morris, of the “Waggon and Horses,” Crocker-street, having been complained of, the magistrates, in granting their licenses, informed the applcants that the police would be instructed to keep a watchful eye upon their houses. —…-Mr. Howes, of. the “Tontine” beershop, applied for and was refused his license because he had been fined three times during the past year for irregularities in his house. John Micffin was refused his license for the “ Horse and Groom,” Upper Pyle-street, from insufficiency of rating.—Henry James was refused his license for the “Orange Tree,” Upper Pyle-street, for being twice convicted during the past year, and for the house not having been decently conducted. …</p>

<h2>Miss Emily Kent<a class="headerlink" href="#miss-emily-kent" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>One name that keeps recurring in the court reports throughout the 1860s is a certain Miss Emily Kent, resident of the House of Industry, whose repeated bad behaviour kept landing her stints of hard labour in Winchester gaol. Despite recognising that the sentences were not having effect on changing her behaviour, the court kept sending her back for more. We can easily imagine “thank you, gentlemen,” as her stock reply.</p>

<p>Emily Kent, a girl of the House of Industry, was brought up upon two charges: first, with being riotous and making use of bad language on the morning of the 19th of March ; and secondly, with bad behaviour at chapel.—The case was proved by the porter of the house, and also by one of the nurses, and the prisoner was sentenced to 14 days’ imprisonment with hard labour.</p>

<p><a class="reference external" href="https://britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000170/18641224/013/0004">Isle of Wight Observer - Saturday 24 December 1864</a></p>
<p>COUNTY PETTY SESSIONS</p>
<p>Before Admiral Sir A. S. Hamond, bart. (chairman), Admiral Crozier, Dr. Leeson, Jas. Coape, esq., and W. G. Shedden, esq.</p>
<p>Harriet Cooper and Emily Kent, two girls of the House of Industry, were brought up in custody charged with disorderly behaviour, and doing wilful damage, on the previous Monday.—The evidence of Elizabeth Mursell, nurse at the union, went to show that she ordered the prisoners to do their work, which they refused to do and became exceedingly abusive, making use of the most disgusting language. They then took off their shoes and threw them at the windows, Cooper breaking 24 panes of glass, and Kent 16. Besides this, they wrote very obscene language on the walls, which she was obliged to have whitewashed.—The prisoners, who had been before convicted for similar offences, were sentenced to six weeks’ imprisonment, with hard labor.</p>

<p class="admonition-title">Unruly and disorderly conduct, August 1865</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000170/18650826/004/0003">Isle of Wight Observer - Saturday 26 August 1865</a></p>
<p>COUNTY PETTY SESSIONS</p>
<p>Saturday.—Before W. G. Shedden, esq. (chairman), Sir John Cheape, Dr. Leeson, Capt. Brigstocke, R.N., R. C. Shedden, esq., T. M. Leacock, esq., and Le Marchant Thomas Le Marchant, esq.</p>
<p>Emily Kent, an inmate of the House of Industry, was placed at the bar, being her sixth time brought before the Court, charged with unruly and disorderly conduct. —Elizabeth Muraell, a nurse at the house, stated that on the previous Monday, between 12 and 1 o’clock in the day, she went into the receiving ward and found the defendant there, and told her to come out, and she said yes, by-and-bye. Witness then told her it was the Governor’s orders that she should come out, but she said she would not, and then sat down at the door till tea time. She, however, went and had her tea, and went back to the ward again, and one of the nurses told her that she had been cutting the table. On taxing her with it she said yes she did cut half, and another girl cut the other half. She then ordered her out, but defendant said she would stop there altogether if she liked. Witness told her she would go and tell the Governor, and went out, but did not do so; and as the other girl left she went away. She afterwards told her to pick her oakum, which she refused do. She then saw something lying on the stones, which she found to be her cap that she had torn to pieces, and shortly after she tore her apron and then her neckerchief.— The Chairman said that she appeared most incorrigible, and that the punishment she had received had done her no good. The Court would therefore sentence her to another six weeks’ imprisonment, with such hard labor befitting her sex, to which the prisoner replied, “Thank you, gentlemen.”</p>

<p><a class="reference external" href="https://britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000170/18671130/013/0003">Isle of Wight Observer - Saturday 30 November 1867</a></p>
<p>BOROUGH PETTY SESSIONS.</p>
<p>Before F. White Popham, esq. (chairman), and C. G. M. Skinner, esq.</p>
<p>Emily Kent was charged for the ninth time with disorderly conduct in the House of Industry, the prisoner having on this occasion attacked the chaplain, the Rev. W. Elgar, with the greatest abuse. It appeared that she had previously been imprisoned for using indecent and obscene language, breaking the workhouse windows, destroying her clothing, and other offences on eight occasions, which, with the present sentence, will make up nearly twelvemonths’ imprisonment in Winchester gaol.—Sentenced six weeks’ imprisonment with hard labor.</p>

<p class="admonition-title">Locked up as many as a dozen times, June 1868</p>

<p>BOROUGH PETTY SESSIONS.</p>
<p>Tuesday.—Before the Mayor (chairman), and Francis Pittis, esq.</p>
<p>Emily Kent, an old offender, was charged with being drunk and using indecent language.—On Monday night, about a quarter to 11, the prisoner began swearing at the picquet in the Market-house, and on Sergt. Mitchell, of the 4th Regiment, telling her to go away, she used very foul language to him. She was drunk, and the Sergeant sent for P.C. Tiley, who went and ordered her away, but she would not go, and made use of the most indecent language to the policeman, who thereupon took her into custody.—P.C. Tiley said that she had been three or four times before the borough magistrates, and within the last two years she had been locked up as many as a dozen times by the county police.—The Bench sentenced her to one month’s imprisonment, and she jumped out of the dock thanking the magistrates, and informing them that she could do that bit on her head very well.</p>
