# A Letter to the Town Magistrates

The builiding of new St Thomas Church, which was well underway, perhaps triggered a renewed sense of both moral mission and civic pride. In October, 1855, a combined delegation "consisting of the clergymen of St. Thomas' Church, the ministers of the different dissenting congregations and others" felt the need to raise their concerns about the public exhibition of disorderly behaviour to the local Magistrates.

In particular, they questioned whether more might be done to regulate disorderly groups gathering on the major public thoroughfares and "frequently conducting themselves in a manner most offensive to virtue" and a closer eye kept on lodging rooms, public houses, and beershops "where attractions are held out to make them the rendezvous of persons whose antecedents create a suspicion that they will prove nurseries of vice".

It's not clear what we can read into their assertion that "they are not seeking any class legislation; their object being the purification of the borough from the social evils which unhappily abound within it" and that "it is their wish to see every offender, whatever be his grade in life, made amenable for his conduct" ? Were they just protecting themselves from claims of attacking what they would see to be the lower orders of society, or were they also sending a message to certain otherwise upstanding members of society who might be engaging in less than virtuous behaviour?!

*I have not yet found a list of the names of the "memorialists" who put their name to the letter.*

During the last week a deputation, consisting of the clergymen of St. Thomas' Church, the ministers of the different dissenting congregations and others, presented the following memorial to the magistrates at the Townhall respecting the social condition of the borough, in the hope that means may be taken to prevent a continuation the present exhibition of indecency and open prostitution which now disgrace its thoroughfares :—

"To the worshipful the Mayor and the Magistrates of the borough of Newport, Isle of Wight.

"The memorial of the undersigned inhabitants of the said borough.

"Your memorialists beg respectfully to state that for some time they have, with many respectable inhabitants, had their attention turned to the moral aspect the borough of Newport.

"A few of the more serious part of the community are laboring, by appliances of a simple, but they trust efficient character, to rectify existing evils; but they fear that, without the cooperation which the municipal authorities can afford, their effort, however well intended, and however admirably conducted, will meet with counteractions too powerful, humanly speaking, for them to surmount.

"Without wishing to cast any reflection upon the municipal authorities, your memorialists request permission to suggest, whether the leading thoroughfares of the borough might not be kept more free from interruption, occasioned by individuals collecting in groups, and frequently conducting themselves in a manner most offensive to virtue — whether the By-Law No. 25 ['Every common prostitute, or night walker, who shall loiter or in any thoroughfare or public place for the purpose of prostitution or solicitation, shall for such offence forfeit and pay the sum of ten shillings'] could not be put in force, so that by its rigorous execution obstructions to a course of immorality might be lawfully created — whether a stricter supervision could not be exercised over lodginghouses, lest they become the resort of characters for whose use they were not intended, and over public houses and beershops, multiplied, your memorialists fear, far beyond the wants of the borough, and where attractions are held out to make them the rendezvous of persons whose antecedents create a suspicion that they will prove nurseries of vice.

"In imploring the magistrates to exercise their authority for the prevention of crime as far as they can, your memorialists wish to be distinctly understood that they are not seeking any class legislation; their object being the purification of the borough from the social evils which unhappily abound within it, and it is their wish to see every offender, whatever be his grade in life, made amenable for his conduct. Any partial application of the law they would deprecate, for intelligent observers of passing events must see that ail efforts to cleanse the fountains of social life are invariably unpopular and fail, unless even-handed justice be administered all transgressors.

"In conclusion, your memorialists would observe that they address you, not as the organ of any political party, or of any religious denomination, but as inhabitants of the borough, deeply concerned for its highest welfare. Upon your aid they rely as invaluable auxiliary to the various benevolent agencies which are now operating for its social and moral improvement. Their aims, they are free to confess, partake of high and sacred character. On an arm more powerful than that which is human, and on means more effective than any legislation can afford, they depend for their ultimate attainment; but as the work is great, and hindrances from various causes multiply, they desire every kind legitimate of cooperation, and that which an intelligent and a vigilent magistracy can afford they appreciate too highly not to seek, and which, from the known character of the gentlemen who sit upon the beach, they feel persuaded they shall not seek in vain.

"And your memorialists respectfully subscribe their names hereto."

Dr. Wavell, on the part of the magistrates, replied that the bench would do everything in their power to remedy the evils complained of.

The editors of the Hampshire Advertiser, apparently against their better judgment, also appear to have been entreated to print the memorial in full, finding it hard "to believe that there exists in the Isle of Wight a place so lost to Christianity, and so devoted to crime, beyond the crying evils of any other place in the kingdom" and that "such a social ulceration has been left to fester amidst the general moral healthiness of the island". But that does not prevent them from repeating the words of their correspondent who  comments on "*the torrent of juvenile profligacy and prostitution*, the streams of which literally choke up our principal thoroughfares of an evening".

Newport, Saturday, October 6.

The Retrograding State of Morals in Newport.

We omitted last week the following memorial, lately presented by the Rev. G H. Connor and other gentlemen to the Magistrates of the borough on this momentous and anxious subject. We have been so earnestly solicited to print the document that we give it insertion against our own inclinations, being unwilling to believe that there exists in the Isle of Wight a place so lost to Christianity, and so devoted to crime, beyond the crying evils of any other place in the kingdom. We are unwilling to believe it. If true, it does not say much in regard to precept and example. The Question arises— how is it that such a social ulceration has been left to fester amidst the general moral healthiness of the island !— to such an extent, too, as thus to meet the severe condemnation of the immediate residents, who *taboo* the town, and will prevent strangers approaching its scenes of vice. Our correspondent says—" We trust all those of the town who have thought seriously of the matter will exert them-selves in every way to *stem the torrent of juvenile profligacy and prostitution*, the streams of which literally choke up our principal thoroughfares of an evening:" This is a horrible picture, and is more out-spoken than the memorial.

`[The memorial is then printed in full.]`

The worshipful the mayor Dr. Wavell, and others of the authorities present, thanked the memorialists for their judicious suggestive hints, and were pleased in feeling that they had the willing co-operation of the respectable inhabitants of the borough.

Court reports in the local press do not appear to reflect any sudden change in the policing of disorderly conduct on the streets, so we might assume the magistrates simply noted the concerns raised for the moment and although they may have also started to discuss whether additional measures were required, and if so, what they might be.

But the concerns were still very much uppermost in the mind of a recent retiree to the Island, a certain Revd. W. Carus Wilson, who had made his home in Ventnor, who was to publish a tract in the early months of the next year that would cause offence to the members of Newport Town Council for the aspersions it cast upon their town.
