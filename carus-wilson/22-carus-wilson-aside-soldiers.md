# Aside — Revd. Carus Wilson and the Soldiers' Institutes

Around the same time as his publication of *Tempters and Tempted* on the Island, the Revd. W. Carus Wilson was also busy on the mainland, a short boat trip away in Portsmouth, overseeing the opening of a SOldiers' Institute.

A report a month of say after it opened in the Leeds Mercury gives a sense of what it involved.

SOLDIERS' INSTITUTES.—

On the 23rd January last, the Soldiers' Institute at Portsmouth was opened. It was described in the prospectus, a copy of which has been forwarded to us by a gentleman who takes much interest in the soldiers' welfare, the Rev. W. Carus Wilson:—

"The Soldiers' Institute comprises a reading-room, supplied with daily and weekly newspapers, and most of the  leading and useful periodicals and current literature of the day. Joined to this, a library for the exclusive use of the members, embracing works in every department in literature, as well as others that may prove useful in their profession. Class-rooms for mutual improvement, and occasional lectures, add another feature to the general object. United with the above are two coffee-rooms, which it is hoped will contribute to the comfort of the members, and tend to lessen the frequenting of public-houses. The subscription is fixed at one penny per week, for which a cheque is given, the possession of which entitles the holder to all the advantages of the institute, for so long a period as it is dated for."

It will thus be seen that the Soldiers' Institute is analagous to the Mechanics' Institute, and is calculated to effect much good by furnishing useful employment and the means of innocent recreation during leisure hours. We heartily wish success to the Portsmouth Institute, and should be glad to see a similar plan adopted in other towns. The country would thus in some measure repay that debt which she owes to our brave soldiers.

A more comprehensive on contemporaneous review of the opening of the institute is given in the *Portsmouth Times and Naval Gazette*.

OPENING OF A SOLDIERS' INSTITUTE AT PORTSMOUTH.

On Wednesday evening a meeting was held on the opening of the Soldiers' Institution, which has been established in King-street, Portsmouth, to afford the soldiers quartered this garrison a library, reading-room, and other conveniences, in which they can employ their time in reading, or other rational amusements during their leisure hours.

The Institution has been established mainly through the instrumentality the Rev. W. Carus Wilson, who first brought the subject forward, and who has been nobly seconded by the officers in the garrison.

Above 100 soldiers, principally of the Artillery, were present at the meeting, nearly fifty whom gave in their names members of the Institution, at the close of the meeting.

Captain Tate occupied the chair, and was supported the Rev. Mr. Childs, Rev. W.C. Wilson, Capt. Campbell, Capt. Savage, G. Rylands, Esq., C. Bintead, Esq. Revs. J. Knapp, J. Power, Capt. Hawke, and others, would have been there, had not circumstances prevented them.

The Chairman, in opening the proceedings, said that for the formation of the Institution they were greatly indebted to the philanthropic spirit of the Rev. W. C. Wilson, through whose exertions it had been brought forward. In the Institution the soldier would find every comfort—newspapers, library, coffee rooms, and every means of rational instruction and amusement, which he hoped would keep many from the haunts which abounded in the town, and lead them to understand that a vicious course of life was incompatible with true happiness. (Cheers.)

Rev. Mr. Childs said he would endeavour to place before the meeting the object they had in view in forming the institute. He formerly lived in a garrison town ( Devonport) for some time, and well knew what inducements were held out to young men in such towns to lead them into wrong paths, and the necessity there existed for the formation of some counteracting influence. The rev. gentlemen then pointed out to the meeting the hideousness of vice, by relating an incident which occurred during his residence Devonport. It was at the death-bed of a woman, who some years previously had been instrumental in causing a marine—her companion in vice—to be transported for a felony, which she, herself, had committed. He described the fearful effects produced by conscience in her last moments, and continued: Their object in forming the institution was to provide them with a "Clubhouse," as it might called, where, when they left their barracks, they might have a lounge, read the papers, and perhaps meet a friend—where they might smoke their pipe, spin a yarn, and fight their battles over again. (Cheers.) If they did not like smoking, there was another room where they could have a quiet cup of coffee, and a comfortable chat with a companion. The room they were now in was the general room, where they would have placed upon a table all the news of the day, by which they might watch their companions in arms fighting for their country in other lands. (Cheers.) They would also have library and class rooms, where he hoped they would get mutual instruction amongst themselves. They did not want see them crammed with lectures, but see them gathering honey for themselves. That was a great fault in Mechanics' Institutes; they gave information, without teaching men to exert themselves; it was if they crammed the stomach without causing them to earn their bread by the sweat of the brow. If they did the latter, they were better in physical health, and if they strove to learn themselves they would be better in mental health. (Hear, hear.) They wanted to see them form classes amongst themselves, in which those who were well instructed might help the others. It was also desired that they should have the management of the institution in their own hands ; that a committee of management should be formed out of the members. As there was a United Service Club, so they wished to form a kind of club for the troops in garrison, and upon its auspicious opening he begged to congratulate them. (Applause.)

Rev W. Carus Wilson, who in rising was received with much applause, said that whatever they did in the way of contributing to the comfort and happiness of the soldier, was only the payment of a moiety of the debt of gratitude which they owed the brave defenders of our country, and which had been much increased during these critical time. He had long seen the necessity of the formation of such institutions and he must say that, although he had taken part in various undertakings, none had given him greater pleasure and satisfaction than the little efforts which he had been able to put forth on behalf of the soldier. He had been much abroad of late years, and had caused many thousand Bibles to circulated in Italy, especially amongst Sardinian soldiers. He should not enlarge upon this subject, as he had promissed to attend a meeting of the Soldiers' Friend Society the following Wednesday evening, when he hoped to give much interesting information respecting his labours in that field; he would therefore simply state that the work had been eminently successful ; both officers and soldiers had taken an interest in it and that at the camp at Boulogne, as well as in Italy, many thousands of Bibles, besides innumerable tracts, had been circulated amongst the soldiery. After speaking of the assistance he had received in the latter piece from the Rev. Mr Brown, the reverend gentleman said that it was a great delight to his mind to meet them that evening, but it was not necessary for him dwell on the advantages of the institution, as that had been so ably done by Mr. Childs, but he would remark that there were many collateral as well as direct advantages attendant upon it. He was glad to see the assimilation of ranks which it produced—that whilst the officer had his club-house, the soldier should have the same, for there was something exceedingly interesting in the fact that men of all ranks and classes were likely to be provided for. He hoped, however, they were as but the commencement of the work, for it was his longing desire to see the "The Soldier's Institute " made as perfect as possible, not only because this was the largest garrison town in the kingdom, but as an encouragement to other places to follow their example. (Cheers.) Some friends at Dover had already made application to him to assist in forming one for the barracks at that town, and he was sure he should find willing helpers there. (Hear, hear.) It would be gratifying to them to know that the proceedings were receiving countenance, not only from the officers of the army universally, but from higher quarters.— Lord Panmure having expressed himself favourable to them. (Applause.) The rev. gentleman then read a letter which had been addressed to Lord Panmure by a military chaplain; it spoke of the temptations to which the soldier was subjected, and remarked that although they could not expect to remove these altogether, it was their duty to do what they could to counteract their influence, and recommended the adoption of a plan similar to that carried out in the formation of the Portsmouth Soldiers' Institute; he said that the ordinary library in the barrack was not sufficiently attractive; something on the principle of a *café* being the *desideratum*. This, continued the speaker, had met with the full approval of Lord Panmure, and whilst considering that they had commenced under very favourable auspices, he hoped to see the day when no garrison town in England would be destitute of such an institution. There was one point he would wish to refer to with to with respect to the collateral advantages of the institution. He thought it best to have it distinct from the barracks, as it would be a greater change for the soldiers, and it would enable them to fraternise with soldiers of other regiments; it would bring them out from the contracted limit of their own little circle, so that they might compare notes with one another. He thought this an important feature in the institution. (Cheers.) He perfectly agreed in the sentiments of the chaplain in the letter he had read—"No acts of Parliament, no efforts of their own, would keep men from evil, or lead them to good;" but although that was certain, they should do what they could. Men's minds were always seeking after happiness and enjoyment, and they should give such a spirit every encouragement in a rational way. In the institution they were now such would be found, and they could enjoy their pipe and tobacco at their ease. With regard to smoking, that had been a debated point, but it was ultimately decided that such should be allowed to all who wished to pursue it. In the library they would find books of all kinds, but although they were not all religious books, he would not disguise from them that the great object they had in view was to make them true soldiers of the Cross, for there could be no true happiness without holiness. Many other things would be given them, and they might rest assured that if they found the premises too straight for them, they should be widened—(cheers)—for they would not rest content without endeavouring to promote their happiness, and he would conclude with expressing the earnest hope that God's blessing would rest upon them and their undertaking.

Captain Savage being compelled to take his departure, the Chairman said, that previous to his doing so, he was sure they would all join in giving to him their hearty thanks for the part he had taken in the undertaking. (Loud applause.) Had it not been for the hearty co-operation of Capt. Savage and other officers, all the efforts of Rev. Mr. Wilson would have been unavailing.

The proposition was carried with acclamation.

Captain Campbell would only say a few words, as so much had been said the objects of the institution previous speakers. Thirty years ago, when in India, he could not help noticing the demoralising character of the army, and he therefore congratulated them that they lived in different times. He hoped they would appreciate the benefits of the institution, and that the present building would be found too small for them, when they would find better accommodation for them in another place. (Cheers.) He would always happy to contribute his mite, and would conclude by wishing prosperity to the undertaking. (Loud applause.)

Rev. W. C. Wilson said there was one little fact which he would like to mention. A friend of his, the late Colonel Hewlett, who fell at the attack the Bedan, stated to him some time ago, that whereas out of his regiment of 850 men, there were formerly 30 in a morning who were brought before him in consequence of having "got into a scrape," since they had formed an institution with a library, &c., for the use of the regiment, they had dwindled down to six or eight. (Applause.) He hoped none in that room would got into such awkward predicaments.

Rev. W. C. Wilson, again rising, said he would remark that if any of the members wished to have any alteration or improvement made, their suggestions would receive the utmost attention.

Rev. Mr. Childs said that it was desired that a practical committee should be formed out of their own body, he would recommend them to consult together to recommend one from each company or corps, in whom they had confidence, on that committee.

Rev. W. C. Wilson read a most beautiful and affecting letter which he had received from soldier at Malta; every word in it breathe a spirit of religious principle, which it was truly delightful to listen to.

Rev. W. Livingstone, after remarking on the practice now observed by the greater portion of the clergy of this country, of offering up prayers for the safety of our soldiers during the war, which he stated originated with the Rev. Mr. Wilson, said that the institution had been established to draw the soldiers from the sources of temptation to which was subjected to enable him meet in place where might enjoy himself without danger to his morals, with friends belonging to other regiments, so as to promote that spirit of brotherhood which it was so cheering to behold. He remembered not long ago, reading a work in which the writer said the glory of England's greatness had departed, that in the event another she would have no men who could maintain her honour, but he thought that when 8,000 Englishmen kept 25,000 Russians at bay for several hours, there was the same enthusiasm, the same unswerving indomitable bravery in them that there ever was (cheers); indeed, he believed more bravery had been shown in the Crimea than at any time in the Peninsula. (Loud applause.) But whilst they had shown such bravery in an earthly fight, there was a spiritual conflict with the powers darkness, which with God's grace, they should carry on strongly and heroically, and he hoped that the establishment of this institution would enable them carry on that fight with success, and prayed that as they had met together that evening, they would meet together before the throne of grace.

G. Rylands, Esq., as one of the Committee, said that other classes of the community had institutions and associations in which they met together for mutual improvement; and so when Mr. Wilson proposed the establishment of soldier's institute, they thought it but right that the soldier should possess the same advantages. (Cheers.) He hoped they would distinctly understand that their wish was that the institution should be under the control of the members themselves; and they hoped that if there was any paper placed upon the table which a majority of them did not approve of, or any other which they would like have, they would inform them of it, and their wishes would be complied with. The time which the institution should be opened would also be left for them decide upon. Every suggestion they might make, which would add to their comfort or convenience, would be attended to, as the Committee wished to make it a model institution from which other towns might take a copy. (Hear, hear.) As had been remarked by former speakers, they would find the table in the room in which they were sitting covered with magazines; the library filled with useful and entertaining books; class rooms, and lecture rooms; they might also, if they preferred it, have some one read to them. Every thing that was possible to be accomplished would be done to afford them instruction; and he hoped that not only every one present would join, but that each would induce a comrade go with him. (Applause.)

Rev. C. Wilson, after stating that the rules of the institution admitted all soldiers in the garrison to its benefits on payment of a 1d. per week, said that coffee also would furnished at the lowest possible price. He had determined to be the first to taste the coffee made in the institution, and he must say that he never tasted any better in England. (Applause.) The committee had also decided on opening the institution on the Sunday, not for reading the newspapers, or anything of a secular character, but for admittance to the religious works in the library, &c. (Applause.) To make the work quite complete, the institution would be furnished with materials for amusement (but not for gambling) in the shape of draught and chess boards and men, backgammon, and a bagatelle board (cheers); these would be supplied with the understanding that, directly or indirectly, no gambling would be allowed. if one set of any of these was not found to be sufficient, he was sure the Committee would gladly furnish more. (Applause.)

A vote of thanks was then given to the Secretary, Mr. Batchelor, and the Chairman; and G. Rylands, Esq., having stated that a gentleman (Mr. D. Barker), agent of Soldiers' Friend Society, had come down from Winchester and attended the meeting to obtain some information preparatory to forming a similar institution in that town.

The meeting separated, about fifty, as we before stated, giving in their names as members.

PORTSMOUTH IN FLAMES!

Our readers wiill rememaber that some few months since a clergynian, the Rev. Carus Wilson, took upon himself the inviduous task of exposing what he termed the vast amount of crime, vice, and degradation existing in the town of Newport, in the Isle of Wight. The pamphlet in which this *expose* appeared excited great illwill and indignation on the part of the inhabitants, some of whom were personally hinted at as being guilty of conduct of, to family men especially, a very disreputabie character. The reverend gentleman had, however, to make a public recantation of these abusive charges. Gaining but little wisdom by his experience, he has now given the borough of Portsmouth, in a pamphlet under the above heading, the benefit of a similar amount of zeal, delicacy of phraseology, and accuracy of statements to that which he displayed in his Newport brochure. The existence of an immense anount of crime and vice in this borough he vouches for on the strength of his own knowledge and experience. He declares that he has visited the haunts of immorality, and seen with his own eyes and heard with his own ears the fearful nature of the doings there. And Portsmouth, not content with such indulgences, spreads a taste, and panders to that taste, in neighbouring localities and communities. For instance, whenever he passes over the floating bridge, he is sure to find vehicles crossing laden with intoxicating drinks, or otherwise engaged in the service of the nameless one— not the nameeless to the reverend gentleman, however, for his tract is full of references to that evil spirit, of the place he inhabits, and the fate he is preparing for myriads of our fellow creatures. The Rev. Mr. Carus Wilson has the visited the bars of gin palaces, and he describes with an apparent relish the scenes he has, or says he has, witnessed. It never appears to have occurred to the writer to whisper a word of counsel in the ear of the vicious and abandoned, or to impart a gleam of hope or a desire for amendment into the heart of a weak and frail creature of humanity.We hear of the members of a faith ternmedless tolerant and charitable, and others belonging to denominations of less pretensions than that to which Mr. Wilson belongs, going about amongst the poor, the outcast, and even the depraved, counselling and exhorting them to hope and amendment; but also refraining from noting down the details of those things which *they* have no other desire or object but to remove. or at least to ameliorate. Impelled, by a lofty `[hunmourously, this looks like "lefty"]` sense of duty, they desire to abate vice and its attendant misery, and to spread abroad the truths of a religion which abounds in charity and love towards the most lowly and outcast of mankind. *They* conceive it to be no part of their mission to pry into revolting facts for the sake of compiling a revolting story, only calculated to horrify the pious, alarm the timid, and harden those who are intended to be exposed. What, we would ask, would be thought of the members of the medical profession, if, instead of applying all the resources of their healing ability to the relief of the sick and the dying, they were to confine themselves to tormenting their patient with horritying details of the frightful character of his wound or disorder, and of the certainty of an immediate and agonisingl death?

We do not see that Mr. Wilson attributes a larger a amount of crime and vice to the borough of Portsmuouth than to other places. He is, we believe, intent on a series of *exposees*, and it is indifferent to him as to what town he will next favour with a notice. We expect to have to peruse, before long, either "Brighton in Blazes,"  "Southampton, the Storehouse of Sin," "Ryde the Ruined, " or some other similarly exciting tract. Now we should imagine that the writer of these diatribes would find in his own immediate neighbourhood, and within his own proper jurisdiction, suifficient of sin and vice to occupy his full attention and solicitude, and that he might leave to the resident clergy of the places he assails the task of doing their particular duty themselves. In Portsmouth, for instance, we have numerous clergy, of all denominations who distinguish themselves by the zeal (*theirs* is unobtrusive zeal) with which they minister to the spiritual wants of the inhabitants of the borough. Mr. Wilson may claim for himself a peculiar "speciality",but if he does it can only be regatded as similar to that possessed by the old contrivance once in vogue in London, of hanging up a lamp in the vicinity of a house of illrepute— as though the making known the fact of the existence of vice would have any effect, of itself, in the spread of morality.

"PORTSMOUTH IN FLAMES," BY THE REV. W. CARUS WILSON, M.A. [COMMUNICATED.]

The perusal of this minimum production has been rather a melancholy duty, plainly exposing as it does, not only a great imbecility of argument and general debility of the reasoning faculties, but also a gratuitous act of misguided censure in a deluded, though perhaps talented writer. I cannot too strongly deprecate the present system of tract concoction adopted by the supporters of a certain extreme party in the Church. To dress up truths of the most sacred character in the flippant garb of popular literature is not only the exponent of an uneducated and superflcial mind, but infallibly secularises most deplorably those holy truths, and subjects them to the low jest of the sceptic and the scoffer. The continual harping upon the most vital doctrines in a slangey and familiar style is productive of immense evil, espenally among the less educated. Why has it become the mark of the Ultra Low Churchman to desecrate the most serious subjects by promulgating them in the form of a jocose handbill ? Religion and wit, slang and scripture, parson and mountebank, are impossible fusions. Here are a few examples published at 3d per dozen" Have youan appetite?" "A man alive;" "There's a good time coming;" "Chaff;" " Which Class ?" " Fast Asleep;" "Dnot Linger;" no doubt suggested by the popular melody "Do not Mingle ." It certainly seems be the mark of a perverted intellect to imagine that sacred truths are only palatable when dressed up in this fashion, and that the world can only be taught religion under "false pretences." Let us, in all humility, suggest to the fertile imaginations of these would be-omnipoteat evangelists, a few texts for their penny-a-line effusions, the entire point of which consists in the large letters on the covers—" Whose your Tailor, or Shriek Irom the Minories;" " Pails and Pattens, or word to Unconverted Chairwomen;" "The Milkman's Niece, or Sequel the Dairyman's Daughter;" "Buttons for Unbeliever's Buttonless Breeches;" " Are you Shaved ?" &c. These would be highly popular and taking amongst the people; already has the text of the above tract been appropriated as a puff by a tobacconist to sell his snuffs and cigars. But to return to "Portsmouth in Flames;" it burns only in the inflamed imagination of the author; it is alight, we are happy to state, only metaphorically. We do not, for one moment, deny the demoralization of this town; we do not deny tbe truth of some portion of this small squib; we do not deny the existence of vice; but we do think the concoction of inflaming handbills in a retired nook of the Isle of Wight a strange way to reduce the general infamy, certainly a very easy and comfortable one. The endeavour to transfer the sin of one class to another is by no means a judicious proceeding. Thus much for the nature of this harmless book. As regards its contents, we will only say if it be divested of some of its arguments and deductions (written apparently under a false impression); if the extreme familiarity with things sacred be altered, and a continual repetition of words (not the most elegant) be abstained from; a word, the book recast, it would present a very different and far more acceptable appearance. The casting the sin of drink from the consumer upon the brewer and distiller seems to be the sole drift of the book. Our author confesses himself unable to tell " where tbe consciences of these men (i.e., brewers and distillers) can be," or how " they expect to compose themselves on a dying pillow, or to stand in the judgment day." This is "very powerful," to use a Portsea expression, and no doubt very popular with the Landport topers. Again, " I cannot fancy any in hell who will have a larger crowd around them of wretched reproachers." This tremendous and highly charitable (?) philippic hurled at the heads of unconverted gin and beer makers, enough to make the most obdurate distiller quake in his boots, and the most hardened brewer as hot as his own grains; and there is only one saving clause connected with these gentlemen, and that is the fact of our author having " met with an interesting case of a converted brewer," and being acquainted likewise with a few "distillers who are beginning tremble." Charging the merchants and retailers of spirits with the entire guilt of this town, converting them into ungodly stokers of the metaphorical flames of Portsmouth, and condemning them finally, body and soul Tophet, is worthy of the most grandiloquent tub orator that Smithfield or Wapping ever saw. Has it quite escaped the Ventnor Demosthenes that the Government, especially in respect of this town, is a most culpable party ? Is this powerful individual oblivious to the fact that since the establishment by act of Parliament, of beer-houses, crime and vice have multiplied ten-fold. Over tbe licenses of these houses, respectable people have power—as long as two parties of sufficient rating can be found to sign their papers, they are impregnable. Not so with inns and taverns—they are under greater control, and are better conducted; and it is a well known fact, that the more debased the place of entertainment for man and beast, the greater attraction will it have for the poor. So long as man is man, and hot weather aud thirst endure, so long will the consumption of exciting beverages last. The existence of breweries, distilleries, beershops, gin-palaces, and gentlemen, engaged in the wholesale and retail of intoxicating fluids, is a great fact; and even if the Rev. Champion were to realise his wish of calling upon such individually, we doubt if he would succeed in adding many to tbe number of his repentant brewers and trembling distillers. How are we to mitigate the evil? or, in the language of tracts, "All hands to the Engine!—who will pump!" Surely not by casting slurs upon the parochial clergy; not by ignoring value of their labors; not by the distribution of crude tracts, filled with commonplace, invective aud erroneous reason; not by the exorcising all brewers, distillers, and magistrates; not by fulsome pandering to the lower orders. These are the means adopted by fanatic demagogues. Counter attractions must be provided for the poor the in the shape of profitable amusement and instruction; their social character elevated by the reorganization of their dwellings; the building of churches, the multiplication of clergy, schools, and working men's institutes—these arc a few of legitimate methods to pursued. Let hope that our clergy will not rest satisfied with groaning over the sins of our large towns in the easy arm chairs of their comfortable rectories, nor confine their energies in such emergencies, to the spasmodic publication of ridiculous tracts under pompous titles, thus completely verifying the truth of that ancient line— *"Parturiunt montes nascetur ridiculus mus."*

Portsmouth Times and Naval Gazette - Saturday 14 March 1857

ANNUAL MEETING OF THE SOLDIERS' INSTITUTE.

The first annual meeting of this Institution was held on Tuesday evening, at the Queen's Rooms, Portsea, Major General Breton, the Lieutenant-Governor, presiding. We also observed on the platform, amongst other gentlemen, Colonel Graham, Lieutenant-Colonel Wright, Captain Harris, R.N., Captain Savage, R.M.A., Major Vallancey, Rev. W, Carus Wilson, Rev. J. P. McGhie, Rev. J. Knapp, Rev. A. Lowrie, Rev. T. Milner, Rev. J. Power (Hon. Sec.), Rev. E. Davis, Rev. J. Davis, Rev. C. Livingstone, Rev. T. Knight, Rev. F. W. Meadows, Rev. C. Tanner, Messrs. C. H. Binsteed and G. Rylands.

The meeting having been opened with prayer by the Rev. J. Knapp,

The Chairman addressed the meeting, and dwelt on the great advantage the institution was to the soldiers in garrison. Libraries and reading rooms might be provided in barracks, but that was not sufficient, the soldier naturally liked to get away from the noise and din of the barracks, and to where he could meet and fraternise with men of other corps. After alluding to the difficulties the institution had to struggle against from the constant changes of the troops in garrison—a cause which prevented officers taking that interest in it, they otherwise would do, he concluded by stating that many of the staff officers of the garrison, who would have felt much pleasure in being present, were prevented attending by pressing engagements.

The Rev. J. Power (Hon. Sec.) then read the report of the Committee. The Committee, after referring the success which had attended their efforts to bring about a more healthy tone amongst the soldiery, and to improve their moral, mental, and social condition, stated that the library of that institution contained upwards of 1000 volumes, all the gifts of friends; that one large room was fitted up as reading room, and supplied with a number of papers and periodicals; that two rooms had been fitted as coffee and smoking rooms, and four others as class rooms. One of the classes was a bible-class, in which about 30 soldiers met to receive instruction. The charge for admission was a penny a week, and a cheque was given in return, entitling the holder to all the benefits of the Institution. 3,233 cheques had been sold during the first year. The attendance of soldiers in the institution varied with the regiments in garrison ; every regiment had, however, supplied members, byt none in greater numbers than the Roval Artillery, and Royal Marine Artillery. Numerous applications had been received from various garrison towns asking for information respecting the Portsmouth Institution, as, in consequence of the reports of soldiers who had left this town, measures were being taken for their formation of those places. The Committee then proceeded to speak of the self-denying efforts of the Rev. W. Carus Wilson, in support of their institution, and also said that at one time it was feared they had not sufficient funds to carry them through the year, but James Lyon, Esq., nobly came forward, and offered to pay half their liabilities, if they could raise the other half. In this they fortunately succeeded. Referring to their financial prospects the Committee expressed their regret that their annual subscriptions amoonted to only £23 whilst their annual expenses would be a little less than £15O. They hoped, therefore, every one would do their best to assist them in their endeavours to increase the amount of their annual subscriptions, so that they might not be driven to depend upon that very precarious source of supply— donations.

Rev. J. Power then read the Financial Statement, from which it appeared that the donations amounted to £2OO ; the subscriptions, £23 5s. 6d., and other receipts made the whole amount to £260 18s. 11 1/2d. The expenditure for the year bad been £257 12s. 4d., leaving balance of £3 6s. 7 1/2d. in favour of the institution.

Letters were read from Major General Lawrence, C.B., the Earl of Carnarvon, Lord Henry Cholmondeley, Captain Boyd, and Colonel Foster, stating the reasons which prevented their attendance.

Rev. J. Power said, before he sat down he would mention that at one time they had many as 400 soldiers holding the cheques of the institution. This was during the militia occupation of the garrison, and was caused by several officers of the Armagh and Staffordshire Militias purchasing cheques, and distributing them amongst their men. This might serve as a hint to other officers, as a means which they might assist the institution at a small expense to themselves.

Rev. W. Carus Wilson moved "That the report now read be printed and circulated, under the direction of the Committee." After remarking that they had cause for gratitude and thankfulness in the tokens of Divine favour that had rested on the Institution, he said one of the favours they had received was that of the Lieutenant-Governor of the garrison presiding over them. His countenance and support wonld not only have an influence in this town, but also in other towns where similar institutions were formed, where their establishment was contemplated. He then detailed the causes which led the establishment of the Institution. His desire do something for the soldier arose from his acquaintance with human nature. Man under all circumstances of life must have some recreation —some amusement,— the soldier as well as others. He therefore said to himself, We must give our soldiers the means of obtaining pleasure, but we will not let them to the beer-shop or the gin-palace— we will establish a central institution where they may enjoy their innocent pleasures, and be alienated from their vices. He mentioned the subject to a few friends, and asked them whether they could not establish a library and reading-room, with means for the soldier enjoy his pipe, and to indulge in innocent amusement. He told them not to let it fail for want of money, as he would take care of that ; and they were now met to congratulate themselves on the success that had attended their efforts. He had no misgivings for the future, for although the annual subscriptions were only £23, and there did not appear much prospect of a great increase in their revenue from that source, yet he would never neglect this child of his—whilst he had a penny left from the claims of his own large family, this branch should receive its portion. (Great applause.) He had a great desire that the Institution should be as perfect as possible for two special reasons, first—Portsmouth being the principal garrison town in the kingdom, it ought to present the most perfect appliances for the moral good of the soldiers and secondly, he wished to see it as perfect as possible, because good never stood alone—it was already being imitated in many other garrison towns—in Dover, Cork, Westminster, and Dublin, and he hoped before he died to see such institutions established in every garrison town in the kingdom. He expressed his pleasure at the sentiments enunciated by the Chairman with respect to the proper locality for the Institution. There was some difference of opinion amongst the officers on this point, but the private soldiers were all of one mind—they were of opinion it should be in the town and not in the barracks. This was most reasonable ; the soldier was naturally desirous of escaping from the confinement the barracks, and as he sought his pleasure in the town so their Institution should be in the town. He concluded by expressing his satisfaction at seeing the rapid return of good they had received from the Institution, and appealed to the meeting to give it increased support.

Captain Harris, R.N,, seconded the proposition. After remarking that Mr. Wilson was the greatest benefactor the institution had, he alone saving it last winter from falling to the ground, he said that when he first came to Portsmouth many years back it was in a most benighted condition, but during the last 10 years he had been gratified at seeing great improvement, not only generally in the town, but also amongst the soldiers and sailors. This institution he considered to be one link more in the chain of civilization. He spoke of the benefit the institution was to the men, and advocated the desirability of its being out of barracks, on the ground that all men liked to have their recreation as far away possible from their places of business—citing the example of the merchants of London, some of whom went daily from Brighton to their counting houses in London. As an instance of the great improvement that had recently taken place in the character of the seamen, be said that out of 2450 men he had had under his command during the last two years, only four cases of drunkenness had occurred. He concluded by showing that it was the interest as well as the duty of all classes in this borough to support so noble institution.

The resolution on being put to the meeting was carried unanimously.

Revd. F. W. Meadows, of Gosport, moved the second resolution—"That this meeting considers the Portsmouth Soldiers' Institute a very efficient means for the mental and moral improvement of the soldiers of this garrison, and is in every way worthy of the support and encouragement of all who have the real welfare of this class their fellow-subjecta at heart." After speaking of the great benefit this institution would be to the soldiery, he expressed his opinion that if the institution were better known by the soldiers, it would be more frequented. As a plea for the public support he said that as it was acknowledged by all persons that they were much indebted to their soldiers, therefore, on the principle of *quid pro quo*, they ought to give them some return for their services. Mr. Meadows also referred to the great improvement that had taken place the character and education of the soldier ; when he was a little boy he remembered seeing a letter from a bombardier, in which he said "it was almost dangerous to be able to read and write." Now, the soldier felt it to be a disgrace not to be able to read and write.

Rev. B. Davis seconded the resolution. That the resolution might not be a mere formality and to make it practical, he hoped those who held up their hands in favour of the resolution, would support the institution to the utmost of their power. Mr. Davis expressed the wish that Woolwich, a town he had been connected with for many years, would soon have an institution of this kind established within its precincts, there being a greater amount of demoralisation amongst the soldiers there than in this town. He stated his admiration of the unsectarian character of the institution and referred to the pleasure he experienced on visits he paid it—once to the Bible class and once to deliver a lecture. The conduct of the soldiers on both occasions excited his admiration. He concluded by expressing a hope that the number of subscribers would be increased, to maintain the institution in a state of efficiency. The resolution was unanimously adopted.
 
Rev. J. Knapp proposed that the thanks of this meeting be given to the Rev. W. Carus Wilson, the founder and liberal supporter of this Institution, and also the other officers and gentlemen of the committee, and that the following gentlemen be the officers of the Institution for the ensuing year:— Patron— Right Rev. the Lord Bishop of Winchester. Vice-Patrons— Right Hon. Lord George Lennox ; Major-General Breton ; Sir Francis Baring, Bart., M.P.; and Right Hon. Viscount Monck, MP. President— Major-General Breton. Vice-Presidents— W. Bell, Esq., M D.; Captain Boyd, R.N.; Captain Evelegh, R.A.; Major Evelyn; Lieut.-Col. Eveleigh ; Lieut.-Col. Ford, R.E.; Colonel Foster, R.E.; Captain Harris, R.N.; Lieut.-Colonel Kennedy, R.A.; Hon. Colonel Littleton ; Rev. J. P. M'Ghie ; Major Nelson; Captain the Hon. P. Pelham, C.8., R.N.; Lieut.-Col. Parke, R.M.A.; Rev. W. Carus Wilson, M.A.; Lieut.-Col. Wright. Committee— C. H. Bicsteed, Esq. ; Mr. T. Batchelor; Rev. T. C. Childs, M.A.; Rev. J. Knapp; T. E. Owen, Esq.; Rev. J. Power, M.A. Hylands, Esq.; Cspt. Savage, R.M.A.; Captain Tate, R.M.A.; Major Vallancey and Major Schomberg. Treasurer— Major Vallancey. Hon. Secretary— Rev. J. Power, M.A. Managing Committee— Captain Savage, R.M.A., Chairman; Rev. T. C. Childs, M.A.; Major Burton; Major Vallancey; G. Rylands, Esq.; Captain Tate, R.M.A.; and Rev. J. Power, M.A. Hon. Secretary to the Managing Committee — W. A. Way, Esq. As one of the local clergy he had much pleasure in identifying himself with this Institution, and proposing this resolution. The thanks of the meeting was a tribute due to Mr. Wilson. No person present knew what he had done for the army, but he (Mr. Knapp) believed that if the British army were polled, the majority of them would recognise the name of Wilson as a name they revered, and honoured, and loved. It was, however, their duty now to pass him a vote of thanks for his kind attention to the Institution, and he was sure they would all admit he deserved it. On the part of the managing committee, he (Mr. Knapp) would say he had greatly assisted them; he had always been kind friend in the greatest straits, and had always been ready to fill up their almost expended exchequer. He had rightly called it a child of his own, and well had he nursed and cherished his child. It was a sapling planted by his own hand, and he hoped he would live long to see it bring forth good fruit, and to see many similar institutions springing up around it. He had also to move a vote of thanks to the managing committee, who well deserved it; they had had great trouble and anxiety, and many difficulties to encounter, but they had met them manfully, and were now enabled to present a report and balance sheet, which showed a balance on the right side. He was by no means one of the most important members of the institution, but he was one of the first consulted, and the idea received his ready assent. He always thought the soldier did not receive fair play. The soldier was spoken of as being very dissolute and drunken, but he never found those persons who were ready to bring these charges, willing step forward to remove the evil. When a regiment came into the town, the soldiers could not always remain in the barracks. They went out for a stroll, perhaps under the burning sun of summer or amidst November fogs, and they required rest. Where could they go ? There was no place open to them, but the beershop. This institution was therefore a step in the right direction. They would now be able to give them a fair chance, and form a true estimate of their character. Mr. Knapp then remarked that although the institution was perfectly secular in its character, and the soldier was perfectly free to choose his own coarse, yet it was impossible for him to be in the company of right minded men, withont being spiritually benefitted by it. It was formerly an opinion, he said, that the most ruffiauly man was the best soldier, but the late war had shown in innumerable instances that the best soldiers were those who were the best soldiers of Christ. He would also have them to remember that England was represented abroad by the sister services. He was much struck by finding that in proclamation of the notorious Governor Yeb, we were described as the people " who reverenced the Sabbath-day and worshipped the God of Heaven," and would therefore wish to impress upon the soldiers present that in whatever part of the world they might be stationed, the honour of England was in their keeping, and as England was great, glorious, and free, let them show that they were not only English soldiers and English men, but also Christian soldiers and Christian men" and that their principle was, to love mercy, to act justly, and to walk humbly with their God.

Major Vallancey seconded the proposition, which was carried unanimously.

Major-General Breton then left the chair, and it was taken by the Rev. J. P. Mc Ghie.

Rev. T. Milner moved, and the Rev. Charles Tanner seconded a vote of thanks to the chairman.

Rev. J. Power rose to support the proposition for the purpose of supplying an omission that had been made. The name of Mr. Mc Cormach, the superintendent and scripture reader had been omitted in the vote of thanks, but he was sure they would all admit he deserved their thanks. Not only had he been indefatigable in carrying out his duties as superintendent, but whilst Mr. Wilson had certainly founded the institution, he believed the idea was first suggested by Mr. Mc Cormack, and Mr. T. Batchelor, of High-street, in conversation that took place whilst crossing the harbour to Gosport.

The vote of thanks was then agreed to, and the chairman returned thanks.

Rev. W. Carus Wilson also returned thanks for the kind manner in which his name had been mentioned, and at the same time thanked Mr. Batchelor and Mr. Mc Cormach for the assistance they had rendered hum.

The benediction having been pronounced by the Rev. W. Carus Wilson, the meeting separated.

To the Editor of the Portsmouth Times and Naval Cazette.

St. John's, Portsea, March 11, 1857.

Sir,— A great omission was made on Tuesday evening at the annual meeting of the Soldiers' Institute, which I should be glad rectify. No reference whatever was made to the name of the Hon. Secretary, the Rev. John Power. The meed of praise was awarded, by name, to others who deserved it, and very rightly so; but to my own personal knowledge, no man has laboured so earnestly, and in a spirit of greater self-denial, to forward the interests of the institute, than has Mr. Power.

The Rev. W. Carus Wilson, to use his own expression, has provided the sinews of war, but the Rev. John Power has chiefly and principally carried on the campaign.

The Rev. W. Carus Wilson has cast and moulded the bullets—and good and true ones they have been proved to be, but the Rev. John Power has been the principal agent in firing them off.

It is simply because I believe that honor should be rendered to whom honor is due, and that, if names are specified, that of Mr. Power ought not to be omitted, that I trouble you with this communication.

I am, sir, your obedient servant, JOHN KNAPP.

The Rev. Carus Wilson, and the Soldiers' Wives.— On Monday a tea party under the superintendecee and the expense of the Rev. Carus Wilson, was given to the wives and children located in Portsmouth, of soldiers serving in India, in the schoolroom of Colewort Barracks. There were between eighty and ninety women, and about 160 children present. After tea, which consisted of a plentiful supply of bread and batter, cake, &c., the rev. gentleman addressed the party in a very kind and appropriate speech, referring particularly to the affairs in India, and exhorting them to put their trust in their best Friend, who is always ready comfort and assist them. On the party breaking up about seven o'clock, Mr. Wilson presented each woman with half a pound of tea, and a proportionate quantity of sugar. One of the women thanked the rev. gentleman for his kindness to them, not only on that occasion, but ever since their husbands left for India, and we are sure no thanks were ever more truly deserved. The band of the Royal Artillery was in attendance, and several ladies and gentlemen were present, amongst others the Rev. E. and Mrs. Milner, the Rev. Mr. Windsor, Sir Harry Varney, Bart, M. P. Mr. Wheatey, Colonel end Mrs. Travers, R.A. Mrs. Ozendon.

MISCELLANEA

Irreverence.— We were recently in country bookseller's shop, and a man put his head in at the door, and asked in monotone, " Have you come to Jesus?" " No, I have not," was the prompt reply, and the inquirer disappeared. The incident was startling at the moment, from the cool tone of the speakers; but, on reflection, it was evident that *Come to Jesus* was one of those little publications, which, like *More about Jesus*, &c, tend so very much to familiarize the lips and lightest thoughts of the people with that holy name which a special commandment forbids should ever be taken in vain. Auother like occurrence came under our observation. We met with a little tract having the title, *Portsmouth in Flames*, and which obviously announced a conflagration in our great marine arsenal, the words being incapable of bearing any other construction. But, like the witty puffs of the tradesman who allures you to perusal by a commencement totally irrelevant to the announcement which he has in store, this title was merely a cloak concealing the writer's denunciations of the sins of a seaport town, and the flame of divine judgment which he concluded must await such a spot. Many of the hymns, too, of the same party are no less open to objection, on account of their irreverent and even amative expressions; and, according to Rowland Hills determination, that the Devil should not have all the good tunes, these effusions have been boldly set and sung to the music of the concert-room. — *"The Low Church  Party," in the Constitutional Press.*

Portsmouth Times and Naval Gazette - Saturday 22 August 1857

To the Editor of the Portsmouth Times and Naval Gazette.

Sir, —You will, I am sure, readily make your columns available for the purpose of urging on your readers the present paramount duty of attending to the wants of the families left behind by our brave soldiers embarked for India. It is as little as we can do out of gratitude them for all they are doing for us, and I must add, out of gratitude to God, for our own distinguished mercy in being permitted to enjoy the peace and comfort of our own homes, to consider the poor families as specially bequeathed to our sympathies.

I know of heart-rending cases in Portsmouth at this moment, e.g. a sergeant's wife, with seven children, the youngest just born; two other tidy, respectable women, with four children each, at a loss what to do or where to go, but most anxious for any kind of work, the babe of one at the breast evidently pining for want of necessary nourishment.

At all eventa, let us cheer our poor soldiers under the heavy anxieties which press upon them, on account of those they have left behind, by letting them see that we are doing all we can to supply their lack:

I do hope that a committee will be formed in Portsmouth to prosecute this work without delay. I am thankful to know that it is contemplated to take up houses, and arrange them for the families at a trifling rent, a plan which has answered admirably for the soldierss families at Parkhurst.

I need not suggest what should be done. Let public feeling and interest be properly turned to the subject, and means won't be wanting to meet the exigencies of the case.

Yours faithfully, W. CARUS WILSON.

Eglinton House, Ventnor, Aug. 13.

PORTSeA ISLAND YOUNG MEN'S CHRISTIAN ASSOCIATIOM

The first annual meeting of this association was held on Tuesday evening at the Queen's-rooms, Portsea, Rev. J. Knapp, president, in the chair. THe attendance of members and their friends was very large.

...

The report, after expressing the thankfulness of the committee to Almighty God for the success that had been vouchsafed to their efforts during the past year, stated that the number of young men who had joined the society since its commencement in November last, was 128, and that the present, namber of members, exclusive of vice-presidents, was 97. The reading room, classes, and lectures, all of which had been active operation daring tbe past year, next came under review, and the assistance of friends in the library departmant earnestly asked for, the books now possessed by the society having been purchased out of the limited funds of the society. ...

[Thanks give to] Rev. W. Carus Wilson, for his valuable donation of maps, charts, and diagrams ...

...

Mr. J. Davis in rising to second the proposition, said he did not come prepared to make a speech, as he fully anticipated listening to the interesting address which was expected from Mr. Wilson, and who he was sure they would regret had been very unexpectly and unavoidably compelled to return home. Under these circumstances he could do little more than express the interest felt in the society, and the pleasure with which he had listened to the report that evening.

Portsmouth Times and Naval Gazette - Saturday 21 January 1860

THE LATE REV. CARUS WILSON

The above venerable servant of God has entered his rest. He was born in 1792 and was eldest son of W. W. Carus Wilson, Esq., who was M.P. for Cockermouth, and for upwards of half a century a magistrate for three counties in the north of England. For some years he had been in a declining state of health, and obliged live far away from his lovely residence in Westmoreland, Casterton Hall, where often resorted some of the best men of the past and present generation; there have played their boyhood, when on a visit with their parents, the late Lord MacCaulay, the sons of Wilberforce, and many others of high name. THe Rev. W. Carus Wilson had the singular felicity of embodying, if not anticipating in his various plans of benevolence, the leading ideas of the age, and his name has long been a household word in every Christian family. In church building, in the diffusion of a cheap Christian literature, and in education, his exertions for a half a century have earned him the blessings of rich and poor. The important church patronage of which Simeon of Cambridge vested in the hands of Mr W. Carus Wilson and three other trustees, as also other churches by others intrusted to him (the building of many which he was cheifly instrumental in), have all been powerful engines for the spread of Evangelical truth. He brought the first penny periodicals that ever appeared in England—" The Friendly Visiter" and "Children's Friend," and afterwards edited the "Christian Guardian" and "Teachers' Visiter." For many years 50,000 copies of these were printed every month. He was thus the father of the cheap religions literature of the day, and blessed results have, indeed, been produced by these in thousands of British homes.

His efforts in the cause of education are chiefly identified with the Clergy Danghters' School, and the School for training Servants and Schoolmistress, at Casterton. From the former sprang similar institutions at Brighton, Bristol, and elsewhere. During the forty years, or more, since it was established by him, it has been the greatest boon to a large number of the clergy, whose daughters are boarded, clothed, and educated there for £11 a-year. Governesses' situatious are found for the girls on leaving; so that there is the two-fold advantage conferred on a clergyman——a sound and cheap education, and future provision for his daughters. In the Servants' School more than 100 poor girls are supported for £10 a-year each. These schools, containing more than 250 girls, are overflowing. They require nearly £1,OOO a-year in voluntary contributions. The late Queen Dowager, after her visit to Casterton, was a warm supporter of these institutions, and often consulted Mr. Wilson in the disposal of some of her charities. At the time of the Irish famine several girls were taken into these schools, free, from Ireland.

Of late years ill health has caused him to live abroad, or in the South of England ; and the interest he was induced to take in the Sardinian army while in Italy was transferred to the British army when he resided afterwards in the Isle of Wight, being there close to Portsmouth.

During the Crimean war Mr. W. Carus-Wilson also put forth much influence and energy in the interests of the French army. Mainly through funds supplied by him, over, we think. NINETY THOUSAND copies of the New Testament (the "Ostervald" version) were placed in the knapsacks of the soldiers ; and over four hundred copies of the Bible were received with feelings marked by gentlemanly courtesy by officers in the French service, including generals, colonels, and all inferior grades.

His sympathy and cordial exertions in this work were not limited to the camps of Boulogne, in which it commenced, but extended to the camp at St. Omer, to Paris, Lyons, Dijon, Pau, and much more extensively at the ports of embarkation at Marseilles and Toulon. Countless thousands of tracts, too, spoke the truth in season and out of season to those brave men who fought side by side with the soldiers of England, when so many laid down their lives during the brief but trying war.

At the time uf the Indian Mutiny, his love for the British soldier was particularly manifested. Among this long neglected set of men he found the warmest hearts under the roughest exterior, and a close personal attachment sprang between him and the soldier. He collected and provided, and found situations for many of their families; and no one who watched the embarkation of some of our regiments from Portsmouth, and witnessed the touching leave-takings with him whom they regarded their father, and heard the sad, yet hopeful commendations of their dear wives and children into his kind hands while they were among the dangers of the deep and the horrors of war, will ever forget these scenes or remember them without a tear. He established at Portsmouth the first Soldier's Institute, from which others have taken their origin. With more than 200 soldiers in India he kept up a monthly personal correspondence; he wrote numbers of tracts, and in three years sent out upwards of one million and a half of Bibles and tracts to soldiers in all parts of the world. Many truly touching letters he received would add, as Lord Shaftesbury once said, "not a little to the religious literature of the day." In him has the soldier lost his best friends, for his heart yearned over their best interest.

In his last printed paper to the soldiers occurs the following sentence from hts pen :—" If life is prolonged, I feel it will be at the intercession of my dear soldiers. Was there ever a poor sinner ever blessed as myself with the privilege and upholding of intercessory prayer ? How many thousands in the prayer and Bible meetings throughout India, as well as Britain,— and, indeed, the world, ± are praying tor me ! Here is a body-guard worth having— dear, praying soldiers moving Heaven. "

Not only the garrison, but in the town of Portsmouth were his labours greatly blessed, in the diminution of crime and drunkenness. So touched was an extensive brewer there by his tract on drunkenness that he conscientiously relinquished his trade. In public life he was a pioneer. His character was remarkable for energy and a moral courage that was sometimes sublime, a most singular forgetfulness of self, and the deepest humility. As a preacher he was fervent, persuasive, and very solemn, with the incidental advantage of a very musical voice, a noble figure, and most benign countenance. The hidden spring of his life from first to last was a mighty power of love to God and man. Few, perhaps, have been allowed to do more for their fellow men, and no one ever felt more how little he had done. When asking the blessing of the Archbishop of Canterbury, who visited him on his death-bed, his Grace replied: " I assure you, my dear friend, I feel it the greater asking a blessing of the lesser."

His deep humility was most touching ; especially when in his last days friends who came to his bedside said they owed everything to him, his quick reply was, " Owe it God, not to me." Nothing grieved him more than to have his good works spoken of. To one of his sons, almost at the last he said, " You may not see in mine a triumphant death-bed, but you will see a poor sinner creeping into heaven." His whole soul, as it were, ran over in kindly consideration for others, and " the Lord be praised" the constant gilding set upon every mercy. He never doubted however harrassed or low, that when he could not trust himself, he could well trust his Saviour's love and strength. Almost the last lines he uttered were the following:—

"Let no proud stone with sculptured virtues rise.  
To mark the spot where in sinner lies;  
Or, if some boast must deck the sinner's grave.  
Boast of His love who died lost man to save."

Shortly before his death he personally commended his schools to the Bishop of Carlisle, and has been kindly engaged, with the Archbishop of Canterbury and the Bishop of Loodon, in placing the trust on a permanent footing; he, with the Bishop of Ripon, Lord Shaftesbury, W. W. Carus-Wilson Esq., and others, will be trustees. Some little time ago Mr. Wilson and these schools were subjected to a severe attack from Mrs. Gaskell, in her " Life of Charlotte Bronte," which was suppressed in the third edition of that work; but it moved him not. Many friends urged him to take up the matter publicly, and even legally ; but here indifference to the world's opinion shone forth, for he felt that what God had so long blessed would continue to be bleased, aud his chief regret in the matter was, that any of his friends or family should have made any defence. A long and admirable letter appeared the *Times* and other papers in his support, and all the leading reviews saw the injustice of the attack. We may say that Charlotte Brontë the gifted authoress, left the Clergy Daughters' School when quite a child, and that very shortly after she had gone, the late Bishop of London, on going over the school, observed to a Middlesex magistrate now living, that "if in the providence of God anything happened to him, he could wish no better a home for his own daughters." Praised be God, the founder's warfare is accomplished; his works will follow him; thousands will rise and call him blessed; his numberless acts of kindness, private as well as public, will never be known till the last great day.

Mr. Wilson departed on the 30th ult., at 20, Montague-place, London, and was interred in the family vault, at Casterton. He is succeeded by his eldest son, W. W. Carus Wilson, Esq., who married the daughter of Edward Litton, Esq., Master in Chancery, late M.P. for Coleraine, and cousin of Sir E. Bulwer Lytton.— Dublin Daily Express.

VENTNOR

LECTURE.—Mr. J. Harding, secretary to the Society for the protection of Women, delivered two lectures on the evenings of Thursday and Friday, May 22nd and 23rd, at the Literary and Scientific Institution on "Subjects connected with the best interests of young men." Mr. W. Carus Wilson took the chair and explained shortly the objects they had in view in calling together the young men of Ventnor. He assured them theycame not as enemies but as their best friends, and he had great pleasure in introducing to them his friend Mr. J. Harding, who he was sure would profitably engage their attention.

Britain's hope is in her youth. We look not to those who have run a lung course of vice, but we wish to stop the young man in his downward degrading carter. From my connection for 12 years with my Society, I find a vaat amount of female vice in the land, and it is rising to such a pitch, as to threaten even to overthrow this great commercial country. There are signs that our country will soon go down in her scale of influence among the nations. If this is allowed to go on, Then Farewell! The lecturer read quotations from works on "Chastity," and the seventh commandment, by Dr. Wardlaw, Mrs. Stowe's brother Dr. Dick, &c. illustrating the subject by these authorities. The room was crowded both evenings, and Mr. Harding was listened to with the most marked attention.

MEETINGS AT THE VICTORIA ROOMS. A meeting was held (so we understand, as we had no intimation of it sent to our office, and consequently knew nothing of it until it was over) on Friday evening last for the important purpose of assisting the funds raised for the benefit of soldiers' wives, 300 of whom are left behind in Portsmouth alone, to starve upon the Government pittance of sixpence a-day, while their husbands are fighting India, and covering themselves with renown, and renown will be their only reward. The meeting, w« believe, was held under the auspices of the Rev. Carus Wilson, the gentleman who created such a sensation in Newport sometime ago upon the question of prostitution amongst soldiers in Parkhurst garrison. Suffice it to say that the organisation of the meeting was a decided failure, the collection after it did not amount to more than about eight pounds; which, after deducting expenses, will leave but little for the object intended. Mr. Wilson's propensity of disregarding public opinion unfortunately not only recoils upon himself but upon those poor miserables who stand in need of help; for is it not preposterous to suppose that £8 is the money representation of the sympathy of Ryde for such a purpose ? Why was not the meeting called by requisition to the Chairman of the Ryde Commissioners (the only corporate body we have), and thus made a town affair, and proper advertisements previously issued to acquaint all the influential and wealthy classes of the subject? We should not have made these remarks had we not perceived by the constant complaints of a contemporary that the disregard shewn towards the Press in Ryde must be the result of design; because, as far as we are personally concerned, we take this view: if any individual or body of individuals underrate our influence or impugn our motives, be it so, for it will not hurt us. Nevertheless, after the legitimate channels of information have been neglected, let no surprise arise if barren results follow.

Another meeting was held on Monday evening (but, as in the former case, we were not apprised of it), the object of which was to assist the funds of the London Missionary Society, through the medium of lecture, illustrated by a panorama of the missionary fields, and with specimens the produce the countries where stations are appointed. The lecture, we hear, was highly interesting, and those spacious rooms were crowded on the occasion. The amount collected, however, was very meagre, being only about £6.

At a public meeting, held at the Victoria-rooms, on the 18th September, tlie Rev. W. Carus Wilson (late rcctor of Casterton, in Cumberland) stated that a great amount of distress prevailed amongst the families of the British soldiers now on their way to India. His appeal was responded to by a collection of £8 after the meeting, and subsequently by larger contributions at the banks and libraries. A ladies' working party made up materials for clothing for the wives and children of soldiers, of which the cost was £10; a further sum of £3 3s. was expended behalf of the distressed wife and family of a soldier; and balance of £45 0s. 3d. was paid into the Portsmouth bank to the credit of the committee, who are there vigilantly and prudently meeting the wants of the families of our brave soldiers, and so relieving the minds of the gallant men of the heaviest care which could follow to their distant sphere of duty.

COMMISSIONERS' MEETING. The usual monthly meeting of the above-named body took place on Monday evening last. Present—Messrs. W. Bush (chairman), J. B. Martin, J. Jewell, W. Bull, J. Wale, G. Mundell, H. Wicker, F. Fisher, F. Moore, and F. Trueman.

It was moved by Mr. Martin, seconded by Mr. Fishes, and carried, " that the offer of a piece of freehold land for the purposes of a police station for £110 by Mr. Rayner be accepted."

The following letters were received and read by the clerk:—One from Mr. Bailey, of Florence-villa, asking for more lights on the Esplanade; to which the clerk was ordered to return an answer, to the effect that the matter should be considered. The next was from the Rev. Carus Wilson, of which we give a verbatim copy:

" Mr. Carus Wilson presents his compliments to the Ventnor Improvement Commissioners, and has to request that they will not allow their agent, Rayner, come to Eglinton-house on any business connected with the Board. Mr. Carus Wilson is only astonished that the Commissioners can continue to employ him, and must regard his being sent into the houses of ratepayers as an insult to their moral feelings and highly discreditable to the Commissioners."

After some discussion the clerk was requested to acknowledge the receipt of the letter, and to express the astonishment of the Board at so uncourteous a letter being sent to a public body.

PUBLIC READING OF INDIAN NEWS

The Rev. J. Knapp, the incumbent of St. John's, Portsea, some time since eatnblished religious services for the people, free of all charges, at a building which had formerly been occupied as circus; the congregations every Sabbath have been large, and the plan is in every respect suoceasful. It is, however, to another arrangement of the reverend gentleman to which we would now direct the attention of our readers. Every Wednesday evening there is service conducted nearly as follows— The National Anthem is sung, after which Mr. Knapp reads a well-digested summary of Indian news, and afterwards reads and expounds some portion of Scripture ; a hymn is then sung, and the meeting is dismissed. We congratulate Mr. Knapp upon his triampbant success ; such gatherings are in every way useful, and calculated to do more good than the issuingof 50,000 such tracts, as "Portsmouth in Flames." On Wednesday last not less than 2,000 persons were presnt, chiefly of the class for which the service was established. We trust the reverend gentleman will persevere in his truly Christian labours. *West Sussex Gazette.*
