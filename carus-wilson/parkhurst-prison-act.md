JUVENILE OFFRNDERS.

The following is a copy of the bill which has been prepared by Lord John Russell and Mr. Fox Mauls, for establishing a prison for young offenders:—

" Whereas it may be of great public advantage that a prison be provided in which young offenders may be detained and corrected, and may receive such instruction and be subject to such discipline as shall appear most conducive to their reformation, and to the repression of crime. And whereas the buildings at Parkhurst, in the Isle of Wight, lately used as a military hospital and as a medical asylum for the children of soldiers, are buildings which may be conveniently used for such a prison; Be it therefore enacted, &c., that it shall be lawful for her Majesty, by warrant under the royal sign manual, to appoint that the said buildings at Parkhurst shall be used as a prieop for the confinemsnt of such offenders as are hereinafter specified, as soon as the same can be fitted and completed for that purpose; and the said buildings shall thereupon become a prison for the lawful confinement of such offenders, and be within the provisions of an act passed in the sixth year of the reign of his late Majesty, intituled, 'An Act for effecting greater Uniformity of Practice in the Government of the several Prisons in England and Wales, and for appointing Inspectors of Prisons in Great Britain.'

"And be it enacted, that it shall be lawful for one of her Majesty's principal secretaries of state to appoint for Parkhurst prison a governor, a chaplain, a surgeon, a matron, and such other officers,assistants and iervants, as may be necessary for the service and discipline of the prison, and at pleasure to remove all or any of the said governor, chaplain, surgeon, matron, and other officers, assistants and servants, and to appoint others in their room, and to fix the salaries to be paid to each of them.

"And be it enacted, that it shall be lawful for one of her Majesty's principal secretaries of state to direct the removal to Parkhurst prison of any young offender, male or female, as well those under sentence or order of transportation, as those under sentence of imprisonment, who having been examined by an experienced surgeon or apothecary, shall appear to be free from any putrid or infectious discemper, and fit to be removed from the gaol, prison, or place in which such offender shall be confined Provided always, that every offender so removed, who shall be under sentence of transportation, shall, nevertheless, be within the provisions of an act passed in the fifth year of the reign of King George the Fourth, intituled, ' An Act for the Transportation of Offenders from Great Britain,' in case the seeretary of state shall direct that he or she shall be afterwards removed from Parkhurst prison, as hereinafter provided.

" And be it enacted, that every offender who shall be so removed to Parkhurst prison shall continue there until he or she shall be transported according to law, or shall become entitled to his or her liberty, or until the secretary of state shall direct the removal of such offender to the gaol, prison or place from which he or she shall have ben brought, or in which he or she may be lawfully confined, and the sheriff, gaoler, or other person having the custody of any offender whose removal to Parkhurst prison shall be ordered in manner aforesaid, shall, with all convenient speed after the receipt of any such order, convey, or cause to be conveyed, every such offender to Parkhurst prison, and shall there deliver him or her to the governor of the prison, with a true copy, attested by such sheriff or gaoler, of the caption and order of the court by which such offender was sentenced, containing the sentence of every such offender by virtue whereof he or she shall be in the custody of such sheriff or gaoler, and also a certificate specifying such particulars within the knowledge of the sheriff or gaoler concerning such offender as may be from time to time directed by the secretary of state; and the governor then give a receipt in writing to the sheriff or gaoler for his discharge; and all reasonable expenses which the sheriff or gaoler shall incur in every such removal shall be paid by the county, riding, division city, borough, liberty or place, for which the court in which the offender was convicted shall have been holden.

" And be it enacted, that it shall be lawful for the secretary of state at any time to order any offender to be removed from Parkhurst prison as incorrigible, and in every such case the offender so removed shall be liable to be transported or confined under his or her original sentence or sentences of transportation or imprisonment to the full extent of the term or terms specified in such sentence or sentences, and shall be subject to all the consequences of such sentence or sentences, in the same manner as if no order for sending him or her to Parkhurst prison had been made.

" And be it enacted, that after the delivery of any such offender as aforesaid into the custody to which he or she shall be so ordered as aforesaid, such governor or other person having the custody of offenders under his direction shall, during the term for which such offender shall remain in his custody, have the same powers over such offender as are incident to tbe office of a sheriff or gaoler; and in case of any abuse of such custody, or other misbehaviour or negligence in the discharge of his office, shall be liable to the same punishment as a gaoler is now liable to by law.

"And be it enacted, that the secretary of state shall be empowered from time to time to make rules for the government and regulation of Parkhurst prison and for the discipline of the offenders imprisoned therein, and to subscribe a certificate that they are fit to be enforced, and all such rules shall be laid before parliament within six weeks after such rules shall be certified, or if parliament be not then sitting, within six weeks after the next meeting of parliament.

"And be it enacted, that it shall be lawful for the secretary of state from time to time to specify, by such regulations as aforesaid, such offences which, if committed in Parkhurst prison by male convicts, shall appear to him deserving of corporal punishment ; and if any male offender in Parkhurst prison shall commit any offence whereby he shall, under any regulation then in force, become liable to corporal punishment, the governor of the said prison shall have power to inflict such punishment.

"And be it enacted, that if any offender who shall be ordered to be confined in Parkhurst prison shall, at any time during the term of such confinement, break prison, or escape from the place of his or her confinement, or in his or her conveyance to such place of confinement, or from any lands belonging to the prison, or from the person or persons having the lawful custody of such offender, he or she so breaking prison or escaping shall be punished, if under sentence of imprisonment, by an addition, not exceeding two years, to the term for which he or she, at the time of his or her breach of prison or escape, was subject to be confined; and, if under sentence of transportation, in such manner as persons under sentence of transportation, escaping from or breaking out of any other prison or place of confinement, are liable to be punished; and if an offender so punished by such addition to the term of confinement shall afterwards be convicted of a second escape or breach of prison, he or she shall be adjudged guilty of felony ; and if any offender, who shall be ordered to be confined in the said prison, shall, at any time during the term of such confinement, attempt to break prison, or escape from the place of his or her confinement, or shall forcibly break out of his or her cell, or shall make any breach therein with intent to escape, he or she so offending, being convicted thereof, shall be punished by imprisonment for a term not exceeding twelve calendar months, in addition to the punishment to which he or she at the time of committing any such offence was subject.

" And be it enacted, that every person who shall rescue any offender who shall be ordered to be confined within Parkhurst prison, either during the time of his or her conveyance to the said prison, or whilst such offender shall be in the custody of the person or persons under whose care and charge he or she shall be so confined, and also every person who shall aid in any such rescue, shall be guilty of felony; and every person having the custody of any such offender, or employed by the person having such custody, as a keeper, under-keeper, turnkey, assistant or guard, who shall knowingly allow such offender to escape, and also every person who shall, by supplying arms, tools, or instruments of disguise, or otherwise in any manner aid any such offender in any escape, or in any attempt to make an escape, though no escape he actually made, or who shall attempt to rescue any such offender, or aid in any such attempt, though no rescue be actually made, shall be guilty of felony; and every person having such custody, or being so employed by the person having such custody as aforesaid, who shall carelessly allow any such offender to escape shall be guilty of a misdemeanor, and, being lawfully convicted of the same, shall be liable to fine or imprisonment, or to both, at the discretion of the court.

"And be it enacted, that any offender who shall escape, break prison, or be rescued in manner aforesaid, shall be tried before the justices of oyer and terminer or gaol delivery, either for the county where he or she shall be apprehended and re-taken, or for the county in which the said offence shall have been committed; and in case of any prosecution for any such escape, attempt to escape, breach of prison or rescue, either against the offender escaping, or attempting to escape, of breaking prison, or being rescued, or against any other person or persons concerned therein, or aiding the same, a copy properly attested of the order of commitment to Parkhurst prison shall, after proof made that the person then in question before the court is the same who was delivered with such order, be sufficient evidence to the court and jury that the person then in question was so ordered to such confinement.

" And be it enacted, that the provisions of all acts of parliament for rendering justices of peace more safe in the execution of their office shall extend to the governor of Parkhurst prison acting in the execution of this act.

" And be it enacted,that all actions, suits and prosecutions to be commenced against any person or persons for anything done in pursuance of this act, shall be laid and tried in the county or place where the fact was committed, and shall be commenced within six months after the fact committed, and not otherwise or afterwards.

"And be it enacted, that a report upon the state of Parkhurst prison, and of the persons confined therein, and also an account of the expenses of carrying this act into execution, shall be annually laid before parliament by the secretary of state.

"And be it enacted, that this act may be amended or repealed by any act to be passed in this present session of parliament."

HELPS FOR THE SAVING OF YOUNG OUTCASTS

[from the SPECTATOR.]

It is a circumstance which serves to relieve political contest of much of its bitterness, that there are grounds, of the profoundest interest, upon which those who are most opposed in the passing questions of the day can meet a nobler struggle for the general good. Of this kind is a subject which has begun to press upon the attention of the public, both from its urgency and from its appealing directly to the common feelings of humanity. The exertions of a few benevolent men have lately thrown the light of inquiry more forcibly on the existing system of treating juvenile delinquents ; and by the help of Parliamentary and Government investigations, the public have been made aware of the monstrous fact, that a large portion of the criminals who crowd the gaols of the country are made so, either by the total neglect of their infant years, or by the very measures which have for their professed object the reformation of the criminal. Laws have been devised, by which parents and relatives are made answerable for the bodily sustenance of the helpless ; but there is no provision for securing to the little wanderer in this world of temptation and error, natural or factitious, even a fraction of the means by which he may learn to guide himself; and, by a refinement in absurdity, those laws which omit all provision for securing the helpless against ignorance, do not permit even inevitable ignorance to be pleaded in excuse for error. It required some such sweeping folly to begin with, in order to make way for the common practice, which babes are solemnly arraigned as criminals, and naughty little children, who " know no better," handed over to the gaoler instead of the schoolmaster. No one who has witnessed the wholesale manufacture of thieves and ruffians in our large towns, can be blind to the truly criminal stupidity of existing laws respecting juvenile delinquents. The raw material for our criminal population exists abundantly, in the shape of children whose parents are occupied in ceaseless toil— dead to their children in habitual drunkenness or habitual imprisonment—or so lost to nature as to drive their children from them. Such are the little wretches whom the old iron dealers of Lancashire seduce with cakes and tartlets to steal bits of iron work from factory yards ; who are sent to continue their education in the gaol, and so, under the tuition of the ablest professors of crime, to graduate in the beer shop.—Such are ————— but we need not pursue the specification of varieties.

Among those whose station and benevolent disposition make a most useful labourer in the good work of remedying this melancholy state of things, we find an old opponent of ours, Mr. Sergeant Adams. As a Judge of the Metropolitan County, he must have had the best opportunity of combining large experience with impartial observation ; and his statements, therefore, bear the stamp of authority. In a recent letter to Mr. Hawes, quoted in the *Times* yesterday, Mr. Adams says—

" In the great majority of cases of juvenile offenders of thirteen years of age and under it, it is unjust to consider them criminals in the ordinary sense of the term,—that is to say, as offenders of sufficient age themselves to comprehend the social duties of civilized life, or offenders who, having been instructed in those duties, have violated them. Many of these unhappy children are waudering and houseless orphans, without a friend to succour them, and committing petty thefts as a means of subsistence ; others are hired by practised ruffians to rob and plunder, and initiated by them in every species of low and demoralizing debauchery. Many are children of poor but respectable parents, seduced by boys of riper years to commit little pilferings, for which they find a ready market; whilst some contribute to the support of their profligate parents by the fruits of their dishonest industry.

" It is not that these boys are naturally more vicious and depraved than the children of honest parents, but that their evil propensities have been encouraged, and their virtuous ones benumbed. How can a child of tender years, who has received no instruction, religious or moral, or who has been sent out by his parents to beg or steal—caressed when successful, and punished when unlucky—form any just notion his duties either to God to society ? And if two or three months' discipline of the tread-wheel, oakum-room, or solitary cell, (repeared at intervals, as the case may require,) could impart them to him, what means has he, when he quits his prison, of putting his newly acquired principles into action ? There is far greater hope, under a kind and judicious system of the reformation of these unfortunate and neglected beings, than of the children of honest and reputable parents who appear at the bar of justice, for such children have had the means of knowledge and neglected it.

" Let assume that Magistrates had the power on the first detection of offenders of tender years, to separate them from their parents ; to place them for such terms as may be needful *in some well-disciplined reformatory school, where they may be trained to industrious habits, not by prison but school discipline ;* and then to send them to some healthy colony, (thus making expatriation the penalty of the parents' sins, and the price of their own moral redemption,) there, under proper superintendence, and removed from their old temptations, to serve out their youthful years as apprentices to well-conducted masters. Who will say that under such a system the majority of such offenders might not be reclaimed and become useful members of society? who will dare to say that the experiment is not worth the trial ?

" A plan of this nature might, a short time ago, have been deemed visionary; but the cause of humanity has made great process during the last two years.

"In the statute for establishing a juvenile prison at Parkhurst, (the most humane act of the session of 1835,) is contained a cause authorizing her Majesty to grant pardons to juvenile offenders, upon condition that they will place themselves under the care of some charitable institution willing to receive them, and giving Magistrates the same jurisdiction over such children as they possess over apprentices.

"Up to tho month of July 1838, the age of seven was the age of legal and moral responsibility ; and no distinction was known in the law between that age and the age of the ripest judgment. By the above mentioned clause iu the Parkhurst Prison Act, a new and glorious principal is recognized. Children may now be treated as children, although they may have incurred the penalty of the law. Education is to supercede incarceration ; and the funds of private charity, and the benevolent exertions of the virtuous and humane, may be legally called in in aid of public justice for the reformation of the young offender. This is a principle in which the Christian philanthropist may unhesilatingly rejoice ; may its practical fruits be worthy of its promise !

" In furtherance of these views, but limiting their application for the present to the Metropolitan district, so that if in practice they prove to be unsound there may be less difficulty in retraciug our steps, I would (so far as regards children under thirteen years) take from Magistrates their present power of summary jurisdiction, and substitute very extensive powers of a different nature ; for I have no fear of summary power when it is to be exercised in moral improvement and not in bodily incarceration.

" When a child is charged with such offences as would bring him within the present schemes of summary jurisdiction, or send him for trial at the Sessions, I would empower the justice before whom he is brought, to dismiss the charge altogether; or direct him to be whipped and locked up upon bread and water for some short period ; or send him under an order to the parish or union workhouse, or under their warrant, at the expence of their parents, if they are of sufficient substance, or the expence of the Government, County, Parish, Union, as the case may require, (the Justice having the power to make the order accordingly\*) to some institution for the reformation of young offenders ; there to remain and abide by its rules, of which ultimate apprenticeship in some healthy colony should, for reasons already given, generally if not invariably, form one. In case of breach of the rules, the Magistrates to be authorized to commit under the authority given by statute 2d Victoria I. ; and if a child who has been so dealt should commit a subsequent felony, the committal to the Sessious to be compulsory, and the punishment transportation. These powers not be understood as superseding the power of committal for trial, which would still be necessary in all aggravated cases, or when the hand of mercy had been held out in vain.

"An opinion, I know, prevails amongst the Prison Inspectors, that children who have been brought before a criminal tribunal and convicted, although summarily, of any offence against the law, should from that time cease to be objects of individual benevolence, and become children of the State, and placed wholly under the control of Government. Of the soundness of this opinion, when the age of childhood is passed, and a conviction has taken place before a regularly constituted tribunal, there can be no doubt: but it does not seem applicable to the cases now under consideration. The infusion of new members gives a constant freshness to the exertioos of charitable institutions, which cannot be attained under the necessary formalities of Government offices ; and private charities must always enjoy more of the parental character than boards. The Cape of Good Hope and South Australia present unlimited fields for the exercise of these benevolent views ; and new societies will be formed, or, amongst the numerous charitable institutions now in existence, a sufficient number will adapt themselves to the plan to remove all doubt as to its practibility. Nor, because the public purse will be in part employed, let a niggardly economy be inlisted against us. It will cost the state less to reform a child in his youth, and make him a valuable subject in a free colony, than to pay for his repeated trials and support him in his various imprisonments through life as a convicted felon."

The childen thus reclaimed from a life of misery and crime might supply a useful class of servants for the Colonies, with great advantage to themselves. But probably it would be advisable not make expatriation an invariable consequence, as it is not indeed a necessary adjunct of the reformatory process. The inmates of the juvenile penitentiary at Auburn, in the United States, are eagerly sought for as servants, in the immediate neighbourhood of the place; so little does the discredit of infant error attach to the well-trained youth who leaves what is known to an admirable school. In fact, to give the reclaimed  delinquent the most satisfactory of characters, it is only nccessarv that the system of reformation to which he has been subjected should be known to be thoroughly efficacious. But without doubt, youths whose earlier ties had been broken would frequently be willing emigrants; and would clearly be of use if the Colonies competed with the Mother-country in offering a home to those who have been resscued from destruction.

\* It is not intended in this letter to into the details of (he plan; but if the principle be recoguized, tbey inay be easily arranged.

PARKHURST PRISON ACT.

A youth, named Thomas Rush, 15 years of age, was convicted of stealing twenty-three yards of printed cotton, value Bs., the property Samuel Meyers.

After the conviction, the superintendent of the Mile-end Ragged School came forward to give the prisoner a character. He had been a scholar in this school, and had been entrusted with money, and he (witness) was instructed by the managing committee of the school to state that if the prisoner was discharged they would undertake to provide for him until he was placed in some refuge, or until some more permanent provision was made for him.

The Assistant Judge said the present case offered a very good opportunity for him to give the committee of this and other Ragged Schools a piece of information, which would be important to them in pursuing their praiseworthy endeavours to ameliorate the condition of such wretched creatures as the prisoner at the bar. In the Parkhurst Prison Act there was clause under which her Majesty had the power, by the recommendation her ministers, of granting a pardon to any juvenile delinquent, on condition that some society or institution for the reformation of that class of offenders undertake to take them under their protection, or to make suitable provision for them. The terms of that pardon gave such society the same power over them as a master had over an apprentice ; and in case they did not fully conform to the rules and regulations of the society, the pardon was rendered a nullity, and the original sentence hung over them the same as if they had never been pardoned. The clause he referred to whilst it was in operation was productive of the most beneficial resuits ; but the prison inspectors were of opinion that such children as those ought to be considered children of the State rather than objects of private benevolence; and under their advice the government of the day ceased to recommend such offenders for pardon, and consequently the clause was rendered inoperative. He, however, thought that if the Ragged School Committees, and other societies that would exercise their benevolence in the manner pointed out by the Act, were to represent the matter to the Home-office, that Sir G. Grey (who was most anxious to improve the condition of our prisoners) would at once be convinced that the restitution of the provisions of this clause would be attended with beneficial results, and with such practical good that would cause it again to be put into active operation. He mentioned these facts order that it might be made public, end trusted that the superintendent would convey them to the committee, who might not be aware of the existence of such a clause.

The superintendent said that would certainly acquaint the committee with his lordshi'’s suggestion.

The Assistant Judge wished them success in their good work, and trusted that the government would accede to their request if they applied for the restitution of the clause. The prisoner was sentenced to ten day's solitary confinement.

JUVENILE OFFENDERS. In the House of Lords on Tuesday, the Duke of Richmond presented a petition from the city of London and four from the town of Reading complaining of the increase of Juvenile Offenders. His Grace urged the necessity of taking some measures on this important subject.— Earl Grey said that boys from Parkhurst Prison had bee m sent out as apprentices to Western Australia, and that system had been found to work well. Parliament, however, must take care not to put these children in better situations than the children of honest but poor persons. (Hear, hear. )— Lord Brougham observed that the committee on Criminal Law had been unanimously of opinion that these children should not be exposed to the contamination of a gaol.

MIDDLESEX SESSIONS.

(Before Mr. Sergeant Adams and a Bench of Magistrates.)

The May General Quarter Session of the peace for the county of Middlesex commenced yesterday morning at the Sessions House, Clerkenwell. There were eighty-three prisoners for trial, of whom seventy-seven were charged with felony.

The learned Judge, in charging the grand jury, said that on the present occasion there was a slight increase in the number of prisoners committed for trial, and he was glad to say that the dawn of a better system for the treatment of juvenile criminals was approaching. He had great pleasure in informing them that there were now in operation some experiments, which he had no doubt would be very successful, and the success of which, he hoped, would lead to the adoption of such experiments as a system ; he alluded to the improvement of juvenile criminals by industrial training. When the Parkhurst Prison Act was about being passed some ten years ago, a clause was introduced by Lord Lyndhurst and Lord Devon, the effect of which was to give the Government the power of granting conditional pardons to such children under fourteen years of age as were taken into the charge of charitable and benevolent institutions with a view to reformation, those institutions or societies having over such children the same authority as that of a master over an apprentice, and that clause, at the time, he considered to be a most valuable one, and for about six months after the act was passed it was acted upon and carried out with great success. However, the prisons inspectors impressed upon the Government that these children were children of the State and not fit objects for the exercise of private benevolence, and the consequence of this was that the clause referred to became inoperative. He alluded to this subject in a charge last year, and, though he was dar from saying that that allussion had called the attention of the Government to it, this he could say, and had great pleasure in saying, that the plan was again in operation. Sir George Grey, the Secretary of State (than whom no man in England desired more to apply an effectual remedy to this serious evil) had directed a number of boys to be sent from Parkhurst to the Philanthropic Farm School at Redhill, to try the effects of the system pursued there, and unquestionably the results would be of a most successful character. As shewing the manner in which opinions changed on popular subjects, he might say that this change was now approved  by the prisons inspectors, by whom it was before condemned, and thus is appeared that they now saw the necessity of choldren being treated as children, and not subjected to a penal discipline. One of the boys that had been selected was sentenced in that court to transportation, and that boy, though not twelve years old, had been convicted no less than 14 or 15 times. By industrial training and moral teaching, much good might be done, and he sincerely hoped that this new state of things was the dawn of a day the sun-light reformation of which would eradicate and blot out from our criminal law the opprobium which, in respect of juvenile criminals, attached to it.

The grand jury then retired.
