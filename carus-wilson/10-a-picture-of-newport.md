At the annual licensing day in 1851, the Tontine Tap, and the Valiant Soldier, also on Cosham-street, were both noted with disapproval by the magistrates for being hosts to prostitution, as was the Old King's Arms on Pyle Street, although the licensee of that establishment objected to the charge.

Borough of Newport Annual Licensing-day.— The Mayor and Abraham Clarke, esq. sat on Monday for granting licenses to public-houses. Most of the renewals passed without observation, but on Robert Dyer applying for a license for the Old King's Arms, the Mayor made some strong observations on the general conduct and character or the house, stating that unless it was better conducted, the license would be refused next year. He said that observations had been made at the last meeting of the Town Council against the house, and the magistrates felt that they had a duty to perform to the public to prevent the annoyance to the neighbourhood, occasioned by bad and dissolute characters resorting to the house.

The applicant observed, that Mr. John Dyer had better put the saddle on himself, rather than accuse him, as his houses were the worst, being let to prostitutes.

Mr. John Dyer said he had given the parties notice to quit, and that he would see the notice enforced.

The Mayor said it was not a mere question whether prostitution was carried on in the house, for if bad characters were allowed to resort to them, and entice soldiers and others to accompany them, it was not observing the terms of the license.

Mr. Clarke observed that the words or the license were, that he should not allow idle and disorderly persons to assemble and meet together in his house. The magistrates had a duty to perform to the public, and they must enforce the law.

Mr. William Mew made some observations on the remarks made in the Town Council, and thought that the remarks made on the police, and on the Old King's Arms, neither truthful or just.

The Mayor, in granting the licenses of the Valient Soldier, and Tontine Tap, gave a similar caution to the applicants.

Portsmouth Times and Naval Gazette - Saturday 30 August 1851

BOROUGH PETTY SESSIONS On Monday, before the Mayor, and Abraham Clarke, Esq.

This being the animal licensing day the court was crowded with persons interested.

On the application of Mr. Robert Dyer, of the old King’s Arms, the mayor addressed him on the complaint which had been made respecting the bad conduct of his house. At a meeting of the Council, remarks were made which the magistrates were bound to notice, and should the same course be pursued the license would be refused another year. Applicant said Mr. John Dyer had better put the saddle on himself than him, for his houses were let to bad characters and allowed nothing of the sort in his house. Mr. Dyer said he had given the parties notice to quit. Mr. W. Mew, as proprietor of the old King's Arms, denied the statements made in the Council, and said the police bad been most improperly charged with partiality in their conduct, Mr. Jenkins, of the White Hart, and Hollywood, of the Tontine Tap had similar admonitions.

--

As we shall see, this area of Cosham Street (now South Street), seems to have well established as one of the rather less than salubrious areas of Newport, with the Tontine Tap and Tontine Yard getting regular mentions in the local Borough Sessions reports, and had done for many years.

Hampshire Independent - Saturday 11 June 1842

At the Petty Sessions, on Saturday last, before the County Magistrates, at the Guildhall.

— The Colonel of the St. Helens Regiment, together with Capt. Woolcombe, the Governor of the Juvenile Prison, appeared in court to complain of the great number of disorderly females which infested the road leading to the Barracks, aud were constantly lying-in-wait around the Barnet-gate, drawing away the attention of the men from their military duty, and occasioning very great inconvenience to the and moreover had been the means of sending many of the soldiers to the Hospital. The Court promised to consider what steps they could take to abate the evil; but it is well known that many of these wretched women —children, we had almost said—had followed the regiment from Winchester and Gosport, and the consequent evils were to be attributed to them. There is, however, a much greater evil existing within the Barrack-palings, and which calls aloud for a remedy. We have no doubt of the justice of the complaint laid by the Colonel of the indecent conduct exhibited without the gate ; but is it not a sin against all morals and decency to eject these miserable unfortunates at all times of the night, when caught within the precincts of the soldiers' quarters, to drive them from the gates to find the best of their way to the town without an article of clothing to cover them. Many of these poor creatures have been met by workmen in the mornings crawling along under the hedges and bye-roads in a state of nudity. Surely a remedy may be found without resorting to this indecent and immoral system to put a stop to the intrusion of improper character into the Garrison.

Hampshire Independent - Saturday 11 June 1842

BOROUGH COURT

James Tansom, landlord of the Fountain Tap `[the following week, he was described as the landlord of the Tontine Tap]`, was charged with keeping a disorderly house of the worst description, and thereby creating great nuisance to the neighbours. Tansom declared himself "as innocent as a chick," and that the disturbances which took place at his house was caused by parties who got drunk at other houses, and came to his to kick up a row. The Bench gave their opinion upon the point by levying a fine of 40s. and costs. The defendant, who is both near-sighted and deaf, declared he could not see why they had fined him (laughter).— We understood the charge to have arisen from the misconduct of a private in the St. Helens regiment, who was found there at a very late hour by the picquet, in company with a prostitute. The soldier attempted to escape by bolting through the garret window, cutting divers pranks along the tops of the houses, and amusing himself with pelting the picquet with bricks from the tops of the chimneys. An unfortunate caper, however, caused a slip in his step, and he was precipitated with great violence into the court yard below, receiving very great injury from alighting on the sharp edges of a water tub which chanced to oppose his progress towards his mother earth. He was immediately carried to the hospital.

Hampshire Independent - Saturday 18 June 1842

BOROUGH COURT—  On Monday, before Mr. A. Clarke.— James Tansom, of the Tontine Tap, who was fined 40s. and costs on the previous Monday, for keeping a disorderly house, now stepped into the defendant's box, and pointed out the hardship, injustice, and cruelty, of fining him, he being perfectly innocent according to his own showing. He said be thought it was a very hard case, for he had a sick wife, and scarcely any of the drunkenness was produced in his house; but people got drunk in other houses. and came to his house, and "knocked up a row." Tansom said he had nothing but the public-house to look to for the support of three of them, himself, his wife, and the doctor (immense laughter); and, besides, he had never been brought before magistrates before from infancy to old age (laughter). As soon as he turned his back to draw a drop of beer, they began their rookery again, and he wished the Bench to take "these here things" into consideration.—The Bench said that it was most extraordinary that these rows, by people who get drunk elsewhere, should only occur in his house ; that women and soldiers should be found in his rooms day and night, on Sundays and workdays, and yet he know nothing at all of it. These things must be by his own conmnt, and the penalty they had inflicted was exceedingly moderate, for if he had had his due he would have been indicted at the sessions. They could not alter their previous decision.—Tansom: " Then you must take me to prison, that's all I have to say."

Borough Sessions

The case of the suspended licences next came on. Mr. James Green, of the Row Barge, who was charged with harbouring loose women in the house, having removed them, was permitted to resume his business.

William Farrow, of the Hope tavern, Pyle street, who stood charged with the same offense, wu further suspended, the police having deposed to a continuation of disorderly behaviour.

Daniel Webb, of the Tontine tap, was also suspended, in consequence of the depraved morals and indecency still carried on in the house —Mr. Wavell observed that he would not consent that this house (which is the property of the Mayor) should ever have another licence. as it had been a nuisance to the neighbourhood for years.—The Mayor's son, who was present, ackoowledged that the house had been very ill conducted, but as the landlord had been fined heavily for his offences, he thought that it had had the desired effect.—The Bench observed that they were in one sense the guardians of the morals of the town, and they considered that houses would be much better conducted if imallords were made aware that the licence would he taken away altogether if such practices were carried on. The magistrates themselves had seen the rows which were taking place every Sunday in that house. Mr. Mew's argument that the landlord had been fined before, was of little avail, as his subsequent conduct proved.—License refused.

John Magee, landlord the Peckhome inn, soother resort for the ahandoned and profligate of both sexes, also had his licence refused.

R. Jenkins, landlord of the White Hart inn, said he had taken a room or two opposite for the girls to sleep in, and the police said an alteration for the better had lately taken place in his house.—License supended.

[We were glad to sse the Bench act with a proper spirit on this occasion, and we trust they will be properly supported by the inhabitants in their endeavors to silence these dens of infamy and immorality. We have seen much indecency and immorality amongst the labouring class who are known by the term "navies," but we defy any person to compare their behaviour with the outrageous conduct of the military and the swarms of promotes who are allowed to congregate in these receptacles of vice, and to such an extent has it lately been practised, that no decent person having the wish to his family a good example, dare take them past these detestable places on their way to or from church or chapel on a Sunday.]

BOROUGH COURT

On Monday last, before  P. Scott, A. Clarke, and R. M. Wavell, Esqrs.

Henry Masom was charged by Charles Green, landlord of the Tontine Tap, with stealing 2 bottles containing spirits.

Prosecutor stated that, on Sunday night, the police came to his house shortly after 12 o'clock, and cleared the house. After they had left, he missed two bottles from the bar, containing rum and gin. Prisoner had been in the house all the evening, and was frequently in the bar. The bottle now produced with the rum in it was his propery; he knew it by the crooked neck, and a mark on the cork, and had used it daily. The prisoner left the house when the police came in.

Bridget Tegg lives in New-street; saw prisoner at the Tontine last night; left altogether at shup-up time; when they got to the corner, prisoner pulled a bottle out of his pocket, and gave her, telling her to drink, and that it was gin. Witness refused; he then drank himself, and handed the bottle to Ann Gladdis, who refused to drink. A young man named Jacob Chessel, who was with witness, told her that Masom had stolen 2 bottles from the Tontine. Witness carried the bottle home with her, and prisoner threatened to kick the door in, if she would not deliver it up. Witness sent for the police, and prisoner ran away; she gave up the bottle to the police; it was the same now produced; it contained a small quartern of rum.

Ann Gladdis corroborated the above evidence.

P.C. Downer was called upon at half-past 12 o'clock to suppress a disturbance in New Street, at a Mr. Toogood's, where the witness lodged, when he found the prisoner hid behind a tree. Tegg gave him a bottle with some rum in it, which she said prisoner gave her; he said he bought it at Cowes.

The prisoner was then remanded until Thursday.

NEWPORT PETTY SESSIONs.—Saturday.—(Before the Rev. R. W. White, S. Sanders, J. P. Lind, and J. Simeon esqrs.)

Felony.— Jane Lock, a wretched denizen of Tontine-yard Cosham-street, was charged with stealing a woollen shawl, the property of Charlotte Newnham, wife of the toll-gate keeper at Node Hill.

Prosecutor stated that on the previous Sunday evening she discovered that an entry had been made into the toll-house by a wi dow, which she was not sure had been fastened the over night. On looking round the room, she missed a work-box and some other articles, and next morning the shawl.

Jane Cheverton, a companion and fellow-lodger, stated that she borrowed the shawl of prisoner, and wearing it in the street on Thursday, was accosted by P.C. Callingham as to how she came in possession, &c. which led to the apprehension of prisoner.

Prisoner, in defence, entered into a long account of her whereabouts on the night of the robbery, when she was locked out by her landlady, and took a walk as far as Shide with a young man whom she did not know, and on her return to Newport she bought the shawl of a woman— name unknown. She was fully committed for trial at the next Quarter Sessions.

BOROUGH SESSIONS

On Monday last, before the Mayor (James Eldridge, Esq.), Abraham Clarke and P. Scott, Esqrs.

James Tansom was charged with having his dwelling house situate in the Tontine yard (part of whoch he lets out in lodgings to travellers), in a most filthy and unwholesome condition, prejudicial both to the inmates and the neighbourhood.

The Inspector gave evidence of the state of the place, which, in itself, was quite sufficient to breed a pestilence, and stated that he had given the defendant due notice to clean it. He had since visited it, and found it in the same condition.

The Mayor: Both unwholesome and offensive. If your house is not cleaned and whitewashed within twenty-four hours, we shall order it to be done, and levy a distress on your goods to pay the expenses; and we subject you to a fine of 10s per day until it is done.

ISLE OF WIGHT COUNTY PETTY SESSIONS.

On Saturday last, at the Guildhall, before the Rev. W. White and other Magistrates.

Isaac Dore was charged by the Governor of the House of Industry with suffering his wife to become chargeable to the Guardians of the Poor. Defendant said that after being obliged to part with his wife through her dissolute and abandoned course of life, he allowed her five shillings a week, until her language every time she met him became so abusive that he discontinued the allowance, when she threw herself into the House of Industry.

Inspector Grapes was called to prove that he bad known the wife of the defendant a long time as a woman of very loose habits; and he had no doubt that she was a common prostitute.

The Chairman was about to discharge the defendant, saying that no husband could be compelled to support a wife under such circumstances, when it was whispered to his worship that such a course of conduct had been pursued by this abandoned woman for years before the defendant married her, and that he did so with his eyes open to her manifold failings.

Mr. White: Oh, that alters the case altogether. You must pay the cost of maintaining your wife in the house, and the costs of Court, and not let her become chargeable in future.

The mayor said the nmagistrates were determined to put down such open and gross vice and imnmorality. It was enough to call down the judgment of the Almighty, if not attempted to be checked. The court would not deal severely in the present instance, but it was intended as a warning to others and to themselves, if brought again before the court. As the defendants had been locked up a considerable time they would be discharged, with the exception of Emma Kimber, who was intoxicated and fined 5s., and 2s. 6d. costs, or one week's imprisonment.

Abraham Racket, charged by the inspector of police with being drunk the night before, between elevere and the twelve o'clock ;—he was so almost every night.—  Fined 5s. with a notice from the mayor that unless the fine was paid he would be placed in the stocks.

Borouoh Court.— On Monday, before tha Major and other magistrates.

A DISORDERLY CHARACTER.

Mary Ann Downer, a very young woman, was charged by Police Constable Cooke with making a great noise, in company with several young men, near tbe White Hart Inn, Pyie-street.

Tho Policeman stated that he ordered her off, but afterwards found her there, with men, at two o'clock ; desired her again to go home; they were all making a great noise; she would not go, and he took her to the station-house ; had often seen her out late at nigbt. but never knew her noisy before, and when sober she is always quiet. Whilst tho girls were out he could never get the men away.

Mr. Grapes, Inspector of Police, in answer to the court, said the prisoner was a common prostitute.

The Mayor observed that he had given instructions to tbe police to endeavour to check the nuisance and wickedness of such proceedings, and he hoped the sentence he was about to pronounce wouid be a lesson to her and others. Such courses end in the destruction of both body and soul, and he hoped the punishment would lead her to reflect on the dreadful life she was pursuing.

Fined 10s and Ss costs, which not being paid, she was committed to the House of Correction for fourteen days.

BOROUGH COURT. On Monday last, before the Mayor, Abraham Clarke, Esq., and Percy Scott, Esq.

...

Charles Gree, landlord of the Toutine tap, was charged with keeping a disorderly house.

Richard Cogger, lace maker, said he lived in Cosham-street. Defendant kept the Tontine tap close by. On Sunday evening, about six o'clock, there was a great noise with the soldiers around the house, both front and back. The conduct of the house at all times was most disgraceful. The house itself was a disgrace to any civilised country. There was nothing going on there but continual drunkenness. Soldiers and common prostitutes were harboured there, and there was continual rows and disorders. The most awful language and imprecations were in constant use, which it was very shocking to hear. The inhabitants around could not open their doors without their ears being insulted; even the house in itself as a house was unfit fur public purposes, there being no back door or convenience to it, and the soldiers and the girls came either into the street and exposed themselves or went into the yard, which was common to many other houses. He believed the girls lodged in the house, they were there every day, and drunk every day. He had complained to the magistrates, and to the brewer (Mr. Mew), and as it still kept going on, he thought it time something should be done.

Defendant : You say I harbour common prostitutes in my house, can you prove I lodge any there?

Complainant : I only know they *are* there, I don't know if you lodge them. I don't go into your house to ascertain that.

Harriet Cogger fully confirmed the testimony of her bushand.

Inspector Grapes said he knew the house in question. There were constant complaints of the house. Six or seven prostitutes were generally there at a time. Had never found any in the bed rooms. There was dancing and fiddling going on there every night, the same as in four or five others of the same class. Defendant's wife was wholly unfit for the house. Defendant had been to him at least twenty times himself to come over to keep her quiet when she was drunk. Such a house must be a nuisance to the neighbombood or any house of that description. They paid proper attention to hours.

Defendant said there were two drinking rooms in the house and three bed rooms, no back yard or back door. The soldiers kicked up the row and went outside. He had done his best to keep them quiet. Had been a soldier himself. Was now receiving a pension.

Mr. Clarke.: If you strive to keep your house quiet and cannot, it shows you are unfit to keep it at all.

Mayor: We have proof of very great mismanagement here, and one allegation of suffering drunkenness is sufficiently proved also. There is clear proof that you have offended against two of the principal points of your license. The first, your allowing disorderly conduct, and the second, your permitting bad characters to assemble and meet together therein. Now it is our duty to put down houses as yours as far as we can, and if any house in the town is proved to be a disgrace and a nuisance, and a moral pest to the inhabitants, yours is that house. We do not wish to press upon you too hard, but we hope you will take warning and mit offend again. So long as we occupy this place, and our attention is directed to disorderly houses, we shall feel it to be our duty to put them down, and we owe our thanks to those who will come forward to expose them. At present we shall only fine you £1 and 5s. costs, and we hope you will pay attention to your license.

BOROUGH SESSIONS

Monday.— Before F. Pittis, esq., mayor; E. Way, esq,, R. M. Wavell, esq., and Thomas Cooke, esq., magistrates.

The applications for licenses for public-houses and billiards occupied the Bench for some considerable time; at the commencement of which, at the request of the Mayor, the clerk read the Act of Parliament relating to the closing all public-houses between the hours 12 Saturday night and 1 on Sunday afternoon, and half-past 2 in the afternoon and 6 in the evening, and 10 at night till 4 o'clock Monday morning, which came into operation on the 6th inst.

No license was taken away from any publican, though the landlord of the "Race Horse" was cautioned in consequence of complaints having been made that he kept a room for the use of the prostitutes of the town.

```

```{warning}
I can't see the Race Horse named on the OS map?
```

The licensing day sessions also provided an opportunity for the magistrates to communicate any updates in licensing conditions. In 1855, this included the announcement that house could be kept "open on Sundays now from 12 1/2 till 3 and from 5 till 11".

Another frequently mentioned establishment, most notably for the landlord's rather cavalier attitude to keeping to the licensed opening hours, was the Crab and Lobster on Deadman's Lane, now known as Trafalgar Road, that goes out of Newport from Nodehill to connect with Carisbrooke Road.

"SOMEBODY IN DE HOUSE."

Joseph Anderson was charged with keeping the Crab and Lobster, in Deadman's-lane, open after ten o'clock on Sunday night, the 24th of September.

Police-constable Lockhart said that on Sunday, the 24th of September, at twenty minutes to eleven at night, he knocked at defendant's house. After some time defendant came to the door. Witness asked who he had in the house? He said no one, and that he would not do anything against the law " for ever so." Witness then went into the yard and let another policeman come in at the back door. They found a man in the closet, and in searching the house found two men in the cupboard, and two also in the coal hole in the back room. There were cups on the sideboard that had been used for beer, also a quart cup and a glass half full of beer in another room.

Defendant said there had been no beer drank after ten minutes to ten. One man was a lodger.

BOROUGH SESSIONS. Mayor F. Pittis, esq. (mayor), and Edw. Way, esq.

Joseph Anderson, of the Crab and Lobster publichouse, was charged with keeping his house open for the sale of beer after 10 o'clock on Sunday night, the 24th ult.

P.C. Lockhart said— I went to the defendant's house in company with P.C. Cave at twenty minutes to 11 on the night in question and heard persons in the house. I stopped at the front door and Cave went to the back door. Cave knocked at the back door and some one asked who it was, and he said, the police. The person did not open the door but went back again into the house. I heard a scuffle in the house afterwards. I rapped several times at the front door, and I heard the defendant say to a boy inside, Why don't you open the door or go and see who it is. A female made reply and said, you know who it is, it is the police. The defendant then came to the door and asked who it was. I told him, the police. He opened the door, and I asked him who he had in his house. He said, no one. I told him he had for I heard them. He again said he had no one; he would not do anything against the law if he knew it, for ever so. I went to the back door and let Cave in. We searched the house and found two men in a cupboard in the back room, two in the coal hole and in the yard, one the water closet. There were cups the sideboard that had been used for beer, and there was a quart cup and a glass half-full of beer in the other room. I told him I must report him. He said he hoped I should not.

In defence, Anderson said no beer had been drawn since ten minutes before 10 o'clock; but, of course, such an excuse would not satisfy the magistrates, and they fined him 20s. and 5s. costs.

Monday.— Before C. W. Estcourt, Esq., mayor; and E. Way, Esq.

Joseph Anderson, of the " Crab and Lobster" beer shop, was charged with keeping his house open for the sale of beer after the time allowed by law, and secreting soldiers at such times.

P.C. Cave, said — I went to defendant's house about half-past 11 o'clock on Monday night, the 19th of February, with the picket, in search of absent soldiers. I was admitted, and defendant's wife said no soldiers were there. Defendant was present. I went to the coal hole door and found it tied inside. I broke the string, and found a soldier concealed in the corner of the coal hole. I asked defendant and his wife if they had any more in the house, and they said, no. I then went up stairs and found two girls sitting by the fire, and two soldiers lying under the bed.

P.C. Hobbs, said—I went to the defendant's house with the picket, on the night of the 19th of February, at about half-past 10 o'clock, and found three soldiers in the kitchen. The picket took them away, and when they got to Nodehill they escaped from the picket. I went back to the house about half-past 11 o'clock with the last witness. P.C. Cave asked if there were absent soldiers there, and Mrs. Anderson denied that there were. We found one soldier tied in the coal hole, and two up stairs. They were the same three soldiers who had been taken from the house. On Sunday last, about 12 o'clock at night, I went to defendant's house, and saw a soldier in the kitchen. I asked the defendant's wife if there were any more. She said, no. I then went up stairs and found soldier bed with a common prostitute. There were two other prostitutes on the second floor, and two men with them. I believe one of the women was a lodger, but not the other women nor the men. I then came down stairs, and Mrs. Anderson let another soldier out of the back door. There are great complaints of the house from the neighbours.

The defendant was fined £2, and 5s. costs, and in default of payment committed to the house of correction for a month.

BOROUGH COURT

BOROUGH COURT. Monday.— Magistrates present : The Mayor (C. W. Estcourt), and R. M. Wavell. esqrs.

"Othello's Occupation Gone."— Joseph Anderson, the notorious occupier of the Crab and Lobster beer-shop (who is just out of Winchester Gaol), was again summoned, for " not being able to keep magistrates' hours," as he terms it.

Police-constable Hobbs stated that last Sunday week he went to the house of the defendant, at three o'clock in the afternoon, and found the front door open. There were between forty and fifty soldiers in the house, and some prostitutes; they were sitting about drinking beer. He went there with a piquet the other night, and they found six girls in bed.

Police constable Stubbs deposed that last Tuesday night, at half-past eleven, he caught about eight couple of men and women there. There were beer-cups on the table, and they were sitting down, listening to defendant singing, "John Anderson my Joe John." Stubbs remonstrated with him, and he merely remarked, that would make another charge against him.

Police-constable Cave proved the service of the summons. The man was not there, and his wife would not take it. She said her husband should not appear. He read the summons over, and put it down in the passage ; he then left. She ran after him, and told him he might light his pipe with it, &c., throwing the summons after him.

Mr. Inspector Grapes recited several cases of previous convictions. He was called in Court, but no one answered, and the Mayor then adjudged the defendant to be fined £20, the license of the house to be cancelled, and himself to be disqualified for selling beer for two years. In default of payment of the fine, to be committed to Winchester Gaol for two months.

BOROUGH SESSIONS

Thursday, before R. M. Wavell, esq., and F. Pittis, esq., magistrates.

August Jager-, beerhouse keeper, was summoned for keeping persons of disorderly character for the purpose of prostitution in his house.

Fined £5 and 7s. 6d. costs, and in default of payment in 7 days amount to be levied distress, and in default of distress to be committed to the House of Correction at Winchester for one calendar mouth.

From another report, we get the sense that running such a disorderly house was not necessarily a full-time occupation, as well as some hint of the character of Rosa Jager, August Jager's wife.

BOROUGH SESSIONS. Monday.—Before C. W. Estcourt, Esq., mayor ; E. Way, and W. M. Wavell, Esqrs.

Joseph Rands, shoemaker, was summoned by Rosa Jager for using profane and obscene language to her.

Mr. Beckingsale appeared for the defendant, and contended that the magistrates had no jurisdiction in the matter; for, even admitting that the language complained of had been used, it was in the defendant's own house, and neither the Act or the By-Law authorised them to interfere with any man for making use of such language in his own house.

The magistrates did not agree with Mr. Beckingsale that his arguments applied to the present case, as it occurred in the front shop, which was a public place, and it was not a private quarrel in the family.

The complainant then said—I am the wife of August Jager, a German. My husband works for Mr. Rands. Last Thursday week I took some work home to Mr. Rands' shop, and went in three times for the money. He said he had no change and could not pay me, and abused me. I told him my husband wanted the money.

Cross-examined by Mr. Beckingsale—I work with my husband at the trade. We have been making slippers for Mr. Rands. He only paid 6d. for making a pair of slippers. [Mr. Rands : I give them 3s. a dozen more than they get in London.] He did complain to them about a pair being made bad, but how could he expect them made better for sixpence ? He did not say he would not pay me till I got him the last my husband had that belonged to him. He said he had no change.

George Frederick Mills, a little boy, was then called by Mr. Beckingsale and stated that he was in the shop all three times when the complainant was there, and that Mr. Rands did not make use of any such language that mentioned the complainant. The case was then dismissed.

```

Eighteen months later, it seems that Rosa may have been somewhat less than faithful to her husband, who seems not to have been too welcoming when she attempted to go back to him.

Mrs. Rosa Jager complained of her husband, August Jager, ill treating her, and turning her out of his house. He is the keeper of the notorious beer-shop Prince Albert, in Deadman's-lane and it appeared that his wife started off with another man about five months ago, and had lately returned, and wanted again to "walk into the defendant's affections," which he reciprocated, on her returning to his house, by giving her a black eye, and kicking her into the street. The case was dismissed.

George Downer was charged with using indecent language in the street. He did not appear. (Mr. Way being a witness in the case did not occupy his seat on the bench during its hearing.) P.C. Hobbs proved to having served the summons on Downer, and Mr. Way said—A few minutes before 9 o'clock on Saturday night, as I was going from my house into the High-street, I heard a great noise, and on getting near where it was I saw Downer pushing woman about and using very indecent language. I told him such language was not allowed to be used in the street, and if he did not home quietly I should find another place for him. He asked me who I was ? I told him a magistrate of the borough, and that it was my duty not to allow such conduct. He then came towards me with the stick I now produce (about 36 inches long and 10 inches round) and threatened to strike me, and made use of similar language to me that he had been doing to the woman. I thought he would have struck me, but he did not. I fancied he had been drinking. I went away down the High-street to fetch a constable, and met Mr. Roach, who had heard what passed, coming with one.

P.S. Grapes said the defendant had been once before for assaulting the police.

A warrant was issued for his apprehension.

I asked her, why; because, she said, I was a whore. I told her to mind her words, sir, for I'd make her prove whether I was one; and she said, she would, I was a nasty drunken whore, sir. Mr. Hobbs here, was present sir and so was another gal, and heard the first and last of it.

Mr. Blake: Did she strike you ?

Complainant: No, sir, she didn't strike me, but she called me a whore.

Mr. Blake: But you summoned her for an assault ?

Complainant: Well, sir, she insulted me by calling me a whore.

Mr. Blake: But that is not an assault.

The magistrates recommended them to use better language towards each other, and live more peaceably as neighbours, and dismissed the case.

I asked Mrs. Mew if she could swear to the counterpane ? and she said it was not her's. I asked Mrs. Crib to go with me, but she would not. When I came back I told her I had been, and she abused me shamefully. I did not go to her house at all. She called me other disgusting names. She did not strike me.

In reports of cases of prostitution, we can occasionally get a sense of where the girls were working.

FEMALE JUVENILE DEPRAVITY.

Caroline Pierce and Ellen Pierce, two girls of the town, were charged with loitering in the High-street, on Wednesday night, at half-past twelve, for an improper purpose. Police-constable Hobbs said that he saw several girls there on the occasion, among whom were Caroline Pierce and, he believed, Ellen Pierce, but was not certain. He went towards the girls, when they passed through the Corn Market and stood under the Mechanics' Institution. He made towards them again, and they then moved towards the Green Dragon-yard. Caroline Pierce and another came back; the other girls went in different directions. He ordered them to go home, but instead of doing so, they went into the High-street. They were constantly in the High-street, and he had seen them speak to gentlemen, and go away with them. They were generally quiet, but the street swarms with girls of that description.— Police-constable Grapes said the girls were continually in the street at an improper hour.— Ellen said she was not in the High-street at all, and Caroline said she had been to a party at the Beehive, and only went into Cosham-street with her companions, who lived there, and she was going home when she met police-constable Hobbs. It should never occur again, and she was very sorry it had now happened.— Mr. Cooke said he had no doubt but that Ellen was as profligate as her sister, and warned them and other girls in Court about strolling the streets at night.— Caroline was fined 10s, and 5s costs, which she paid immediately.

Complainant's door was not locked.

Police-constable William Lockhart deposed to complainant's running up to him with only his shirt on, and could hardly speak for fright. He said a man had got into his house.

He was a militia man, and had taken his cap, coat, and belt off, and also placed a chair and table before the front door. In defence, the defendant said, " I had no intention of going to the house to do any harm. I had some drink, and did not know what I did."— He was fined 10s, and 5s costs.

They were both on the pavement. Mr. Mew, the landlord of the Bugle came and requested me to remove them as they had dinner party who were very much annoyed by them. I spoke to defendant and requested him to go way. He said, "these gentlemen (pointing to three men in the Bugle') wish me to sing a song. I said, I had nothing to do with that and wished them to move on. Defendant looked to the men in the Bugle and asked them if they did not want him to sing a song. They made him no answer. Defendant began singing. I told him I should lock him up if he did sing, and he then went to the gentlemen and asked them to give him something. They said, you sing a song and I will. He then began singing and I took him into custody. In coming down the street he struck me with a fist and kicked me in my legs. He got his leg between mine and threw me. He pulled a quantity of hair out of my head with both his hands. He then got away. P.C. Lockhurst and I afterwards apprehended him in Cosham-street `[the original name of South Street]`.

Newport Petty Sessions

Saturday—Before Sir H. P. Gordon, Bart, (chairman), A. J. Hambrough, Esq., and T. Cooke, Esq. 

Rebecca Smith, a common prostitute, was charged by William Stevens with stealing his coat.

It appeared that the complainant went into field to fight with another man and the defendant held his coat for him and he had never seen it since, but there being no proof against the prisoner that she stole the coat she was discharged in this case, but was then charged with stealing a book, " Light Hearts and Happy Days," from the shop of Mr. Frank Etheridge.

Mr. Etheridge deposed to having seen the book produced in his shop about a week since, and swore to its being his property by the private mark he had written in it and by his own stamp, which was in the book.

William Bolton, an acting corporal the Rifle Brigade, said that last Monday evening he met the prisoner in the barrack-yard Parkhurst, and that she went into his room with him and another man, and from thence into the canteen, where she showed him the book now produced and asked him if he would like to read it, and when they left the canteen she gave it to him, and he said he would return it to her the next evening, but the next morning he gave it to the pay Serjeant, who, in his presence, gave it to the police constable now present.

P.C. Purchase, being sworn, said—I apprehended the prisoner last Monday night about quarter to 10 o'clock, on Hunny-hill, on the charge of stealing a coat, handkerchief, and some money, belonging to William Stevens. I asked her where the red-cover book was that she had been reading that day, and she said she returned it to its owner. I asked her who that was and she said, you have got that to find out, but she afterwards told me that it belonged to a soldier. The next morning I went to the barracks and obtained the book of a serjeant in the presence of the last witness. I saw the prisoner the same day, and asked her where she got it from but she did not say. I took her to Mr. Etheridge's shop this morning, as she had told me she had bought a pennyworth of paper and an envelope there, to see if they (Mr. Etheridge, his wife, and daughter, who served the shop) knew her, and when there I said to her, where was the book, on the glass case or with those books (some that were together on the counter) you can tell me or leave it alone, it will neither make it better worse. She said, I took it off the glass case.

The prisoner had nothing to say in defence, and she was committed to the Sessions.

It appeared that she had also been committed on the Wednesday previous for stealing a memorandum book from Mr. John Mew's shop.

On Saturday, James Nobbs and Edward Woodford were charged with breaking into tbe house of Mr. John Hewitt of West Cowet, grocer, and stealing £25. Alfred Hewitt described tbe premises, which were secured in tbe usual manner on the previous Saturday night. The next morning a writing-desk, containing £65, a missionary-box, and two spirit decanters, were found to have been taken from tho parlour. Mrs. Hewitt gave similar evidence. Sarah, wife of Joseph Woodford, deposed that Nobbs was at her bouse on the night in question ; he said he was waiting for Ned Woodford. She heard Woodford's voice outside, and said. "There is Woodford." He tben left, and at half-past two he returned, and said. " Arn't you gone to bed yet?" Mary Phillips deposed that Nobbs came on Sunday to the Tontine, Newport, and asked to have some dinner, for which sbe charged 1s. He gave her a sovereign in payment and said he was going to sea, round Alexandria ; that he had drawn a month's pay, and came to have a spree before he went. A Policeman came to ioquire about him, and she pointed him out. Elizabeth Georgiana Watson, a woman of the town, deposed she lived in the Tontine-yard. Nobbs came to her lodgings on Sunday evening. She saw that he had a sovereign and half-sovereign ; he gave her 3s. He took out some dark-looking paper from his pocket squeezed together. She endeavoured to snatch it from him, when he said, "Don't; they are £5 notes." Witness said, "There will be a chance to get the things out of pawn, in the morning, won't there?" He gave her one of the notes, such a one as that produced (National and Provincial Bank). Witness asked for some money to get some drink ; he gave her 3d. She went to the Tontine, where she saw a Policeman, and heard he was inquiring for notes. She went back, and put the note in the fire. She afterwards obtained the other three notea from the prisoner, and the man of the house put them also into the fire. Police-serjeant White deposed that he went to Mr. Hewitt's house on the previous Sunday, when he found the shutter had been removed from the court. He could not find where the entry had been effected until Monday. He went to tbe Tontine, at Newport, and apprehended Nobbs. Woodford was brought to the station on Monday. He made a confession which was produced, signed by him, to the effect that he and Nobbs got into Mr. Hewitt's store about ten o'clock on the previous Sunday morning, by opening a clap, and from thence proceeded to the parlour, where they found tbe missionary-box, and two decanters of spirits. They carried the things to tbe store, took out £95 from the desk, partook of the spirits, and left the remainder in a tub in the loft. (The articles were now produced and identified). Nobbs said to witness, when Woodford's confession was read over, tbat it was all true, except that the desk and missionary box were left in an old tea-chest, and not a tub. Police constable Purchase gave evidence in corroboration. Herbert Barnes, in the service of the prosecutor, gave evidence that he locked up the store, and that one of the prisoners had brought sawdust tbere on some occasions. No defence was attempted, and both prisoners were committed to the Assises, on the charge of burglary.

NEWPORT PETTY SESSIONS.

Saturday.—Before Rev. R. W. White, chairman ; Sir H. P. Gordon, Bart., Sir John Simeon, Bart., Hon. W. aCourt Holmes, and A. J. Hambrough.

George Lang and Charles King, the two privates of the 93rd regiment, who were remanded from Thursday last for breaking into the Riding School at Parkhurst barracks, and stealing therefrom several articles from the baggage which was stored away there, were again brought forward.

Richard Gough, color sergeant of the 77th depot, stationed at Parkhurst, was first examined, and said— I do not know either of the prisoners. Part of the articles now produced were my charge. On Tuesday morning last, having heard of a robbery being committed in the riding school at the barracks, I immediately went to see if any of the packages that were left in charge by Colonel Graham Egerton, of the 77th regiment, on his leaving England with the regiment for Constantinople, were disturbed. I found that a bed vellese had been opened and a buffalo's skin, a pair of blankets, bolster, two feather pillows, pilot jacket, and a polka cloak had been taken out of it. About the 17th ult. I had the vellese taken to my quarters to be aired. I saw it unpacked, and afterwards packed the things in myself. It was taken back to the riding school on the 23rd. It was fastened by buckles, and not locked. It was never opened at my quarters after I packed it. I know it was full when taken back to the riding school, because it took two men to carry it. The riding school is not locked during the day, but whether it is at night I am not aware. On the 24th I put my hand inside the package to see if the things were all right, and found that they were. On coming from church to the parade ground we had to pass through the riding school to get to the parade ground. When I came out of church last Sunday I turned round and looked at the vellese and saw that it was quite tight, and just as had previously left it. All the things I have mentioned, except the pilot jacket which is not here, are those now produced. I believe there were other packages broken open belonging to the 95th regiment, but I only had charge of those of the 93rd.

Elizabeth Sterrett, a common prostitute, living in the Tontine yard, Cosham-street `[the original name of South Street]`, Newport, was next examined, and said—On Tuesday morning last, about half-past seven, the prisoner Charles King brought to my house a bundle tied or rolled up in something black like a coat or cloak. He said he found it, and asked me to let it stop at my house a bit. I said yes. He did not open it, nor did I. He took it upstairs into my bedroom. He came down stairs again, and remained there till the police constable came, about ten o'clock the same morning. He gave no account of where he got it. A girl from Portsmouth was having some breakfast with me when he came. I left them together in my house and went across the yard to the public house, and whilst there the policeman came and asked me if knew Charles King, and I said yes. He said, where is he. I said in my house. He asked me if he had brought a bundle. I said yes. I told him to go in and look for it. I told him to go up stairs. I went with him. King was in the house, concealed in the cupboard. The policeman brought down the bundle and opened it in my presence. There were four articles in it; a blanket, pillow, cloak, and pair of boots. I cannot swear that those now produced were the articles the policeman took away. I have not seen the prisoner Lang since somewhen last week. I saw King at the Tontine public house about seven or eight on Monday evening.

Jane Lock, another of those unfortunate girls, living in the same yard as the last witness, said— I know the prisoners. I saw King on Monday night. On Tuesday morning, about half-past seven, I saw him in the Tontine yard. I was in a neighbour's house the time. When I went into my own house, I saw some things there. It was about half-an-hour before I went to my own house. I did not see King away, or what become of him. When I went up stairs I saw a blanket and pillow had been put on my bed, and when I came down stairs again and looked in the cupboard, I found some wet shirts and a sheet. The blanket and pillow were laid loose on the bed as if they belonged to the bed. I am sure they were not there when I left the house. Just after I found these things my house King came in, and I asked him if he had brought the things and put them where I found them. He said, yes. I begged him to take them away. He said he would presently. He had nothing else with him. I then went out and King followed. I went across the yard. I returned in about ten minutes and found the pillow was gone. King was then in Elizabeth Sterritt's. I went into him and asked him if he had taken the pillow. He said, yes. I said to him, I wish you would come and take the rest away. He said he was going home bye-and-bye and he would take them with him. Whilst I was talking to Mrs. Sterritt P.C. Hobbs and the picquet came up the yard. The policeman took charge of the things and carried them away. I did not see anything of Lang.

P.C. Hobbs deposed to having gone with P.C. Purchase in search of the prisoner King, and to having found, at the witness Lock's house, four wet shirts, a wet sheet, and blanket, which he produced; and that he afterwards went to the barracks with Purchase, who took from Lang's foot a shoe and compared it with some footmarks in a garden adjoining the riding school, through which the prisoners must have have passed with the things to get from the barracks unseen, and which marks corresponded exactly with Lang's shoe.

P.C. Purchase was next examined, and said— In consequence of information I received on Tuesday morning last, I went to the barracks and received from Sergeant Gough a list of some things that had been stolen. I then went into the riding school and through a door at the side leading into little garden, where I saw some footmarks. There was another door in the garden which led into the summer parade field. Some new buildings had been erected near the garden, and the clay from the foundation had been thrown into the garden which, being quite soft, made the footmarks very plain. There were the marks of the feet of two men in the direction of the field from the door. I got some stones and covered up some of the plainest of the tracks. I then went to the Sergeant Major and asked him if there were any men absent last night. He said, Charles was. I then came into Newport, and went into the Tontine yard with P.C. Hobbs—four soldiers came down with me. I went into the witness Sterritt's house and went up stairs, and received from her a blanket, a polka cloak, pair of boots, and a coat. She said, King had brought them there. I now produce the things. I then came down stairs and apprehended King; he was concealed in a cupboard. I told him I should take him into custody for stealing those things from the riding school. He said, then you'll take me for what I haven't done. As I was coming to the station house with him custody, I said him, how do you account for having those things in your possession? He said, I found them on the side of the road between the barracks and the toll-gate. I asked him, when ? He said, last night, just after nine o'clock, when I was going to the barracks, just after the first tattoo, I picked them and brought them into the town; I was late, and I stopped absent.

From further information I received, I went to the barracks again in the afternoon with Hobbs. I went to Lang's quarters where he was, and told him I must have his shoes to compare with some footmarks. He took them off. I then went to the garden and compared them with the footmarks there, and they corresponded exactly. I now produce the shoes. I then went back to Lang's quarters and took him into custody. The buffalo skin and the other pillow were found in the field.

This being all the evidence there was against Lang the magistrates thought it insufficient, and discharged him.

Adam Mc'Pherson, sergeant of the 93rd Regiment, said— I know the prisoner King. I have known him for eight years. I was on duty on Monday night, and he was reported absent from tattoo. I remained on duty till Tuesday afternoon two o'clock ; during which time he did not come to the barracks. On Sunday and Monday he was on duty as sentry at the riding school, which gave him an opportunity of seeing what was there. Sometimes the door of the riding school is not locked at night. During the night of the 29th ult., about twelve o'clock, the sentry at that post reported that some one had broken into the riding school. In consequence of which I went over, and discovered the side door which leads into the garden open. I saw the top partly off one box and the things in a ruffled state. That box belonged to the 77th Regiment. The baggage of five different Regiments was there. A box belonging to the 95th had also been disturbed.

The prisoner said, I am guilty of having the things, but not of taking them. I found them on the road-side. I never looked to see what they were; if I had known what they were, I would have had nothing to do with them.

Committed to the Sessions.

The prisoner was then charged with and committed for stealing the shirts from the washhouse at the barracks, they being identified by the woman who was washing them the day before.

BOROUGH COURT

MONDAY — Magistrates present: Dr. Wavell and Edward Way, esqrs.

SOLDIERS" SPREE.

Joseph Bailey, William Campbell, John Beadlestone, and Thomas Lyons, privates in the Sth Regiment, were charged with breaking into a house in Tontine-yard. (Most of the tenements in this den are inhabited by persons of ill-fame, and the general resort of the soldiery).

Elisabeth Sterrett said she lived in Tontine-yard, and was a widow. At about three o'clock in the morning on Sunday week she was in bed and heard a kicking at the door, and then heard a shutter broken open and one or two panes of glass break. When she had got a light four soldiers walked up to her room. Campbell was the first that came in. Beadlestone was another. She did not know the other two. Campbell said "Blood this night I'll have," and tried to tear her night clothes off her. Witness screeched " Murder!" and they went down stairs— she *threw* one down. Went down stairs and found four more— Lyons was one ; did not know the other ; they all got out through the window, and one of them said, " Campbell, smash some more windows," and they smashed several. There were eight panes broken—cost 8d a pane. Witness paid 8d for a bolt to fasten the shutters; the table was broken all to pieces, worth 4s. Witness did not miss anything, and they did not offer her any violence ; she was only frightened. Campbell struck her before the officers, when she was picking them out.

Ann Philips said she lived in Tontine Yard ; heard Sterrett call " murder," looked out of window and saw the soldiers break the window with a stick ; saw they belonged to the 4th Regiment, did not know any of them, there were eight or nine.

P. C. Hobbs said that on the night of last Saturday week, he saw several soldiers come from Tontine Yard, proceeded there and saw the windows of Sterrett's house were broken. Knew Lyons and Campbell in the party, but could not identify the others.

Lyons, in defence, said he never was near the place.

Beadlestone said he was not in the streets— was not with this party all night.

Campbell was " not there at all at all."

Beadlestone called John Windgate, a private in the 8th, who said he was out of the barracks that night in a state of intoxication, and had been to sleep near a mill. When he awoke about daybreak he saw Beadlestone was there. Had not seen him before, and did not know where he had been in the night.

Bailey was discharged. The others were fined 10s and 3s 6d costs each, and, in default, committed to Winchester for one month.

Petty Sessions

Saturday.—Before Sir H. P. Gordon, Bart., Chairman ; Sir John Simeon, Bart.; Capt. Hamond, R.N.; Capt. Crozier, R.N.; and Thomas Cooke, Esq.

...

James Caffrey, a private in the 77th Regiment, servant to Philip Daucey, Esq., ensign, stationed at Parkhurst Garrison, was charged with stealing a coat, waistcoat, a gold enamelled ring, a gold pin, a set of gold shirt studs, set of coral studs set gold, a pair of gold and a pair of silver wrist studs, the property of his master.

Mr. Daucey, on being sworn, said —the prisoner was my servant and had access to my room and the charge of everything therein. On the 7th of May he left me, and after he had gone I looked over my things to see if anything had been taken, and I then missed the articles now named in the charge. They had all been taken from my drawer or from the mantle-piece. The drawer was not kept locked. I did not see any of the articles after I had missed them, until yesterday morning, when they were shown to me by the Sergeant of Police. The prisoner was absent from the barracks from Monday morning until the next Sunday morning, when he was brought in as a deserter. I can swear that the things now produced are those I lost.

Thomas Green, jun., chimney sweep at Newport, deposed to buying the coat of the prisoner for 2s. 6d. and an old coat.

Anne Jones, a common prostitute, living in Paradise-row, Newport, deposed to having received the ring from the prisoner and afterwards leaving it in the care of her landlady, Mrs. Leonard, who gave it up to the Police.

Elizabeth Pragnell, of the Oyster-shell houses, near Newport, said the prisoner came to her house in private clothes, with a girl, and asked to be allowed to stop there the night, which he did, and that he represented himself to belong to some ship about to be paid off at Portsmouth, and left with her the gold pin and studs for 15s., saying that he would take them again of her when he received his money.

P.S. Stannard then deposed to receiving the articles which he now produced of the several witnesses, and to taking the prisoner into custody. Committed to the sessions.

Portsmouth Times and Naval Gazette - Saturday 22 May 1852

Borough Petty Sessions, Monday.— Present, C. W. Estcourt, Esq., Mayor, E. Way, and R. M. Waveli, Esqs.

Ann Tayler was charged with being drunk and disorderly at the Tontine Tap on Sunday night. She was turned out of the house, but returned, when she was given into custody. John Hollywood gave evidence that the defendant came his house and drank with the soldiers, using very bad language, which he was determined not to allow. The defendant said was owing to her having had a little drink ; if the Court would forgive her, she would leave the Isle of Wight that day. The Mayor said it was not a very serious charge, and they would dismiss the case provided she would leave the Isle of Wight.

BOROUGH SESSIONS. Monday.—(Before F. Pittis, Esq., mayor; C. W. Estcourt, E. Way, Esq., and R. M. Wavell, Esq., magistrates.)

Henry Lewis, an elderly man, was charged with stealing apples. P.C. Cave said, in consequence of information he received he went into Cosham street on Saturday night, about half-past twelve, where he saw the prisoner, and on feeling his pockets found they contained the apples produced. He charged him with stealing them, when he said he had purchased them of a country person about five o'clock, but did not know whom. The mayor said the magistrates had very little doubt but that the prisoner had stolen the apples, it was very improbable, if he had purchased them as he said, that he would have carried them (being nearly a gallon) about in his pockets for seven hours and half; that P.C. Ward acted quite right in bringing him here, but as evidence was wanting for conviction he (the prisoner) would be discharged.

Frederick Spanner, William Lewis, and Willam Lewis, were charged with breaking into a public house in Deadman's Lane, on Saturday night, and helping themselvcs to bread and cheese and beer, and then walking off. Mr. Coxhead, the proprietor, said, he did not wish to press the charge as the prisoners were very good customers of his (although he did not know when they had been to his house last), he felt sure they only done it for a drunken spree, and not defraud him. The chairman said that after the statement made by Mr. Coxhead, the magistrates should discharge them, and Mr. Coxhead seemed to have very queer notions to who were good customers and who were not, he doubted not but others would walk into his house in the same way.

Newport Petty Sessions

Saturday—Before Sir H. P. Gordon, Bart, (chairman), A. J. Hambrough, Esq., and T. Cooke, Esq. 

An inquest was held at the Medina-inn, on the 17th inst., before F. Blake, Esq., coroner, on the body of a new-born female child.

Joseph Read, being sworn, said— I live in Quaystreet, Newport. Yesterday afternoon, about 3 o'clock, I was coming from the Grove into Newport. My attention was directed to something in the stream near Sea-street. I got it out, and found it was the body of a child—the body which has now been viewed by the jury. It was tied up in part of the lining of a gown, and part of a brick was also enclosed. It was tied in two knots, and pinned at the edges. The lining and brick are now produced. The brick was not near the head of the child. It was a female child. I observed a bruise on the fore head. It was near Mr. Hallett's coal wharf. I delivered the body to Mr. Cross, the landlord of the Medina inn, Newport. The brick was clear of the body, hung in the string the bundle.

Thomas Denness was next examined, and said— Yesterday afternoon, about one o'clock, I saw bundle tied up and pinned. It resembled the wrapper now produced. It was near the hatch of St. Cross' mill. That was about 300 yards from the place described by the last witness. I tried to reach it, and touched it with my foot. On my touching it, it fell over the hatch. It fell heavy. It was then high water. It must have fallen seven or eight feet—probably two feet of water when it fell.

Mr. Robert Horlock, surgeon, then said— I first saw the body of deceased about four o'clock yesterday afternoon. I examined the forehead and found it had a dark appearance, and there appeared to be extravasted blood beneath the scalp. The face was also a great deal discoloured. The left arm was lying across the upper part the chest, and the flesh of the arm quite flattened. An impression upon the chest where the arm had been lying across the body. The right arm in a flexed position. The umbilical cord had been divided close to the navel, apparently with an instrument, either scissors or a knife; but no ligature had been applied. A medical man or a midwife would have applied a ligature. The legs and thighs were also flexed and flattened. I think the body must have been tied up in the bundle while warm. There was eccleymosis of the blood-vessels on the arms and thighs, which prove that circulation had taken place after delivery. It was a full-grown female child. I should say that it had been dead more than a week—between a week and a fortnight. Decomposition had commenced on the surface. On turning the body over, I observed a good deal of crepitation under the left shoulder. I afterwards made an internal examination of the body. On opening the chest, I found the lungs and heart perfectly healthy. The vessels on the right of the heart, and the pulmonary vessels were much congested. The lungs appeared red and healthy ; and on making an incision into the lungs, blood flowed. It crepitated to the touch. I have not the slightest doubt that the child was born alive. I put a portion of the lungs into water, and they floated. The stomach was perfectly empty. The child had never taken food. The bladder was also empty, which showed that the child must have passed water after its birth. I then removed the scalp ; and underneath the scalp, on the right and upper side of the forehead, over the frontal bone, there was considerable quantity of extravasated blood. No extravasation under the other portion of the scalp. There is a membrane which covers the bone, (called the pericranium) and there was extravasated blood between that membrane and the bone. The place of the extravasation corresponded with the black appearance in the forehead; and I should think it was occasioned by a blow from a blunt instrument, as it did not cause any wound. On opening the head, I found the membrane of the brain a good deal congested, more particularly underneath the frontal bone, corresponding with the extravasation externally. That might have arisen from the same injury. The injuries which I found in the head, were sufficient to have caused death ; and I consider they must have been inflicted while the child was alive. It was a very fine child, and I could find nothing to account for its death from natural causes. If the mother had been delivered while standing, and the child had fallen on a stone floor, it is possible, though not probable, that it may have sustained injuries such as I have described. The injury might have been occasioned either from heavy fall a hard floor, or from a blow from a blunt or flat instrument.

Verdict,— " The deceased was found dead, and that death was occasioned by injuries received on the head, but no sufficient evidence to shew whether the injuries were inflicted wilfully or accidentally."

Ragged Schools.—These schools which have for some time past been opened the evening for instructing the poor in Cosham-street, both morally and religiously, are now found to be as far increased to require another room, and have consequently removed to Sea-street. We are pleased to observe that the names upwards of 100 children are entered on the books, and we hope that the inhabitants of the town and neighbourhood will assist the Committee, pecuniary and personally, in carrying out good work.
