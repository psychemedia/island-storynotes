<p>Whilst the public battle over his reputation was being fought in the public press by his son, during the second quarter of 1857, the Revd. W. Carus seems to have continued to support the Soldiers’ Institute, as well the soldiers barracked in Gosport, the families of soldier serving overseas, and, by means of a regular correspondence, those soldiers sent recently to India.</p>

<p>ANNUAL MEETING OF THE SOLDIERS’ INSTITUTE.</p>
<p>The first annual meeting of this Institution was held on Tuesday evening, at the Queen’s Rooms, Portsea, Major General Breton, the Lieutenant-Governor, presiding. We also observed on the platform, amongst other gentlemen, Colonel Graham, Lieutenant-Colonel Wright, Captain Harris, R.N., Captain Savage, R.M.A., Major Vallancey, Rev. W, Carus Wilson, Rev. J. P. McGhie, Rev. J. Knapp, Rev. A. Lowrie, Rev. T. Milner, Rev. J. Power (Hon. Sec.), Rev. E. Davis, Rev. J. Davis, Rev. C. Livingstone, Rev. T. Knight, Rev. F. W. Meadows, Rev. C. Tanner, Messrs. C. H. Binsteed and G. Rylands.</p>
<p>The meeting having been opened with prayer by the Rev. J. Knapp,</p>
<p>The Chairman addressed the meeting, and dwelt on the great advantage the institution was to the soldiers in garrison. Libraries and reading rooms might be provided in barracks, but that was not sufficient, the soldier naturally liked to get away from the noise and din of the barracks, and to where he could meet and fraternise with men of other corps. After alluding to the difficulties the institution had to struggle against from the constant changes of the troops in garrison—a cause which prevented officers taking that interest in it, they otherwise would do, he concluded by stating that many of the staff officers of the garrison, who would have felt much pleasure in being present, were prevented attending by pressing engagements.</p>
<p>The Rev. J. Power (Hon. Sec.) then read the report of the Committee. The Committee, after referring the success which had attended their efforts to bring about a more healthy tone amongst the soldiery, and to improve their moral, mental, and social condition, stated that the library of that institution contained upwards of 1000 volumes, all the gifts of friends; that one large room was fitted up as reading room, and supplied with a number of papers and periodicals; that two rooms had been fitted as coffee and smoking rooms, and four others as class rooms. One of the classes was a bible-class, in which about 30 soldiers met to receive instruction. The charge for admission was a penny a week, and a cheque was given in return, entitling the holder to all the benefits of the Institution. 3,233 cheques had been sold during the first year. The attendance of soldiers in the institution varied with the regiments in garrison ; every regiment had, however, supplied members, but none in greater numbers than the Royal Artillery, and Royal Marine Artillery. Numerous applications had been received from various garrison towns asking for information respecting the Portsmouth Institution, as, in consequence of the reports of soldiers who had left this town, measures were being taken for their formation of those places. The Committee then proceeded to speak of the self-denying efforts of the Rev. W. Carus Wilson, in support of their institution, and also said that at one time it was feared they had not sufficient funds to carry them through the year, but James Lyon, Esq., nobly came forward, and offered to pay half their liabilities, if they could raise the other half. In this they fortunately succeeded. Referring to their financial prospects the Committee expressed their regret that their annual subscriptions amounted to only £23 whilst their annual expenses would be a little less than £15O. They hoped, therefore, every one would do their best to assist them in their endeavours to increase the amount of their annual subscriptions, so that they might not be driven to depend upon that very precarious source of supply— donations.</p>
<p>Rev. J. Power then read the Financial Statement, from which it appeared that the donations amounted to £2OO ; the subscriptions, £23 5s. 6d., and other receipts made the whole amount to £260 18s. 11 1/2d. The expenditure for the year bad been £257 12s. 4d., leaving balance of £3 6s. 7 1/2d. in favour of the institution.</p>
<p>Letters were read from Major General Lawrence, C.B., the Earl of Carnarvon, Lord Henry Cholmondeley, Captain Boyd, and Colonel Foster, stating the reasons which prevented their attendance.</p>
<p>Rev. J. Power said, before he sat down he would mention that at one time they had many as 400 soldiers holding the cheques of the institution. This was during the militia occupation of the garrison, and was caused by several officers of the Armagh and Staffordshire Militias purchasing cheques, and distributing them amongst their men. This might serve as a hint to other officers, as a means which they might assist the institution at a small expense to themselves.</p>
</div>
<p>Needless to say, the Revd. W. Carus Wilson also had something to say, on the one hand re-affirming the need for soldiers to have somewhere to go and something to do, on the other still not properly seeming to get the idea that the initiatives he kept initiating and involving himself in were not really sustainable without the ongoing support of generous third-party benefactors.</p>
<div class="dropdown admonition">
<p class="admonition-title">A desire to do something for the soldier</p>
<p>Rev. W. Carus Wilson moved “That the report now read be printed and circulated, under the direction of the Committee.” After remarking that they had cause for gratitude and thankfulness in the tokens of Divine favour that had rested on the Institution, he said one of the favours they had received was that of the Lieutenant-Governor of the garrison presiding over them. His countenance and support wonld not only have an influence in this town, but also in other towns where similar institutions were formed, where their establishment was contemplated. He then detailed the causes which led the establishment of the Institution. His desire to do something for the soldier arose from his acquaintance with human nature. Man under all circumstances of life must have some recreation —some amusement,— the soldier as well as others. He therefore said to himself, We must give our soldiers the means of obtaining pleasure, but we will not let them to the beer-shop or the gin-palace— we will establish a central institution where they may enjoy their innocent pleasures, and be alienated from their vices. He mentioned the subject to a few friends, and asked them whether they could not establish a library and reading-room, with means for the soldier enjoy his pipe, and to indulge in innocent amusement. He told them not to let it fail for want of money, as he would take care of that ; and they were now met to congratulate themselves on the success that had attended their efforts. He had no misgivings for the future, for although the annual subscriptions were only £23, and there did not appear much prospect of a great increase in their revenue from that source, yet he would never neglect this child of his—whilst he had a penny left from the claims of his own large family, this branch should receive its portion. (Great applause.) He had a great desire that the Institution should be as perfect as possible for two special reasons, first—Portsmouth being the principal garrison town in the kingdom, it ought to present the most perfect appliances for the moral good of the soldiers and secondly, he wished to see it as perfect as possible, because good never stood alone—it was already being imitated in many other garrison towns—in Dover, Cork, Westminster, and Dublin, and he hoped before he died to see such institutions established in every garrison town in the kingdom. He expressed his pleasure at the sentiments enunciated by the Chairman with respect to the proper locality for the Institution. There was some difference of opinion amongst the officers on this point, but the private soldiers were all of one mind—they were of opinion it should be in the town and not in the barracks. This was most reasonable ; the soldier was naturally desirous of escaping from the confinement the barracks, and as he sought his pleasure in the town so their Institution should be in the town. He concluded by expressing his satisfaction at seeing the rapid return of good they had received from the Institution, and appealed to the meeting to give it increased support.</p>
</div>
<p>A second speaker, in seconding Carus Wilson’s request for increased financial support, commented on the steady improvement of conditions over the last few years, and the contribution the Soldiers’ Institute had (in the last year) made to it.</p>
<div class="dropdown admonition">
<p class="admonition-title">A great improvement</p>
<p>Captain Harris, R.N,, seconded the proposition. After remarking that Mr. Wilson was the greatest benefactor the institution had, he alone saving it last winter from falling to the ground, he said that when he first came to Portsmouth many years back it was in a most benighted condition, but during the last 10 years he had been gratified at seeing great improvement, not only generally in the town, but also amongst the soldiers and sailors. This institution he considered to be one link more in the chain of civilization. He spoke of the benefit the institution was to the men, and advocated the desirability of its being out of barracks, on the ground that all men liked to have their recreation as far away possible from their places of business—citing the example of the merchants of London, some of whom went daily from Brighton to their counting houses in London. As an instance of the great improvement that had recently taken place in the character of the seamen, be said that out of 2450 men he had had under his command during the last two years, only four cases of drunkenness had occurred. He concluded by showing that it was the interest as well as the duty of all classes in this borough to support so noble institution.</p>
<p>The resolution on being put to the meeting was carried unanimously.</p>
</div>
<p>It was then the turn of various other members of the clergy to have their say.</p>
<div class="dropdown admonition">
<p class="admonition-title">The mental and moral improvement of the soldiers</p>
<p>Revd. F. W. Meadows, of Gosport, moved the second resolution—“That this meeting considers the Portsmouth Soldiers’ Institute a very efficient means for the mental and moral improvement of the soldiers of this garrison, and is in every way worthy of the support and encouragement of all who have the real welfare of this class their fellow-subjecta at heart.” After speaking of the great benefit this institution would be to the soldiery, he expressed his opinion that if the institution were better known by the soldiers, it would be more frequented. As a plea for the public support he said that as it was acknowledged by all persons that they were much indebted to their soldiers, therefore, on the principle of <em>quid pro quo</em>, they ought to give them some return for their services. Mr. Meadows also referred to the great improvement that had taken place the character and education of the soldier ; when he was a little boy he remembered seeing a letter from a bombardier, in which he said “it was almost dangerous to be able to read and write.” Now, the soldier felt it to be a disgrace not to be able to read and write.</p>
<p>Rev. B. Davis seconded the resolution. That the resolution might not be a mere formality and to make it practical, he hoped those who held up their hands in favour of the resolution, would support the institution to the utmost of their power. Mr. Davis expressed the wish that Woolwich, a town he had been connected with for many years, would soon have an institution of this kind established within its precincts, there being a greater amount of demoralisation amongst the soldiers there than in this town. He stated his admiration of the unsectarian character of the institution and referred to the pleasure he experienced on visits he paid it—once to the Bible class and once to deliver a lecture. The conduct of the soldiers on both occasions excited his admiration. He concluded by expressing a hope that the number of subscribers would be increased, to maintain the institution in a state of efficiency. The resolution was unanimously adopted.</p>
</div>
<p>A vote of thanks was then proffered to Carus Wilson and the members of the committee, and the new committee welcomed.</p>
<div class="dropdown admonition">

<p>Rev. J. Knapp proposed that the thanks of this meeting be given to the Rev. W.

</div>
<p>A further dedication to Carus Wilson was also offered, and then accepted, before the meeting eventually came to a close.</p>
<div class="dropdown admonition">
<p class="admonition-title">And a particular thankyou to Carus Wilson</p>
<p>The thanks of the meeting was a tribute due to Mr. Wilson. No person present knew what he had done for the army, but he (Mr. Knapp) believed that if the British army were polled, the majority of them would recognise the name of Wilson as a name they revered, and honoured, and loved. It was, however, their duty now to pass him a vote of thanks for his kind attention to the Institution, and he was sure they would all admit he deserved it. On the part of the managing committee, he (Mr. Knapp) would say he had greatly assisted them; he had always been kind friend in the greatest straits, and had always been ready to fill up their almost expended exchequer. He had rightly called it a child of his own, and well had he nursed and cherished his child. It was a sapling planted by his own hand, and he hoped he would live long to see it bring forth good fruit, and to see many similar institutions springing up around it. He had also to move a vote of thanks to the managing committee, who well deserved it; they had had great trouble and anxiety, and many difficulties to encounter, but they had met them manfully, and were now enabled to present a report and balance sheet, which showed a balance on the right side. He was by no means one of the most important members of the institution, but he was one of the first consulted, and the idea received his ready assent. He always thought the soldier did not receive fair play. The soldier was spoken of as being very dissolute and drunken, but he never found those persons who were ready to bring these charges, willing step forward to remove the evil. When a regiment came into the town, the soldiers could not always remain in the barracks. They went out for a stroll, perhaps under the burning sun of summer or amidst November fogs, and they required rest. Where could they go ? There was no place open to them, but the beershop. This institution was therefore a step in the right direction. They would now be able to give them a fair chance, and form a true estimate of their character. Mr. Knapp then remarked that although the institution was perfectly secular in its character, and the soldier was perfectly free to choose his own coarse, yet it was impossible for him to be in the company of right minded men, without being spiritually benefited by it. It was formerly an opinion, he said, that the most ruffianly man was the best soldier, but the late war had shown in innumerable instances that the best soldiers were those who were the best soldiers of Christ. He would also have them to remember that England was represented abroad by the sister services. He was much struck by finding that in proclamation of the notorious Governor Yeb, we were described as the people “ who reverenced the Sabbath-day and worshipped the God of Heaven,” and would therefore wish to impress upon the soldiers present that in whatever part of the world they might be stationed, the honour of England was in their keeping, and as England was great, glorious, and free, let them show that they were not only English soldiers and English men, but also Christian soldiers and Christian men” and that their principle was, to love mercy, to act justly, and to walk humbly with their God.</p>
<p>Major Vallancey seconded the proposition, which was carried unanimously.</p>
<p>Major-General Breton then left the chair, and it was taken by the Rev. J. P. Mc Ghie.</p>
<p>Rev. T. Milner moved, and the Rev. Charles Tanner seconded a vote of thanks to the chairman.</p>
<p>Rev. J. Power rose to support the proposition for the purpose of supplying an omission that had been made. The name of Mr. Mc Cormach, the superintendent and scripture reader had been omitted in the vote of thanks, but he was sure they would all admit he deserved their thanks. Not only had he been indefatigable in carrying out his duties as superintendent, but whilst Mr. Wilson had certainly founded the institution, he believed the idea was first suggested by Mr. Mc Cormack, and Mr. T. Batchelor, of High-street, in conversation that took place whilst crossing the harbour to Gosport.</p>
<p>The vote of thanks was then agreed to, and the chairman returned thanks.</p>
<p>Rev. W. Carus Wilson also returned thanks for the kind manner in which his name had been mentioned, and at the same time thanked Mr. Batchelor and Mr. Mc Cormach for the assistance they had rendered hum.</p>
<p>The benediction having been pronounced by the Rev. W. Carus Wilson, the meeting separated.</p>

<p>To the Editor of the Portsmouth Times and Naval Cazette.</p>
<p>St. John’s, Portsea, March 11, 1857.</p>
<p>Sir,— A great omission was made on Tuesday evening at the annual meeting of the Soldiers’ Institute, which I should be glad rectify. No reference whatever was made to the name of the Hon. Secretary, the Rev. John Power. The meed of praise was awarded, by name, to others who deserved it, and very rightly so; but to my own personal knowledge, no man has laboured so earnestly, and in a spirit of greater self-denial, to forward the interests of the institute, than has Mr. Power.</p>
<p>The Rev. W. Carus Wilson, to use his own expression, has provided the sinews of war, but the Rev. John Power has chiefly and principally carried on the campaign.</p>
<p>The Rev. W. Carus Wilson has cast and moulded the bullets—and good and true ones they have been proved to be, but the Rev. John Power has been the principal agent in firing them off.</p>
<p>It is simply because I believe that honor should be rendered to whom honor is due, and that, if names are specified, that of Mr. Power ought not to be omitted, that I trouble you with this communication.</p>
<p>I am, sir, your obedient servant, JOHN KNAPP.</p>

<p>VENTNOR</p>
<p>LECTURE.—Mr. J. Harding, secretary to the Society for the protection of Women, delivered two lectures on the evenings of Thursday and Friday, May 22nd and 23rd, at the Literary and Scientific Institution on “Subjects connected with the best interests of young men.” Mr. W. Carus Wilson took the chair and explained shortly the objects they had in view in calling together the young men of Ventnor. He assured them they came not as enemies but as their best friends, and he had great pleasure in introducing to them his friend Mr. J. Harding, who he was sure would profitably engage their attention.</p>
<p>Britain’s hope is in her youth. We look not to those who have run a long course of vice, but we wish to stop the young man in his downward degrading carter. From my connection for 12 years with my Society, I find a vast amount of female vice in the land, and it is rising to such a pitch, as to threaten even to overthrow this great commercial country. There are signs that our country will soon go down in her scale of influence among the nations. If this is allowed to go on, Then Farewell! The lecturer read quotations from works on “Chastity,” and the seventh commandment, by Dr. Wardlaw, Mrs. Stowe’s brother Dr. Dick, &amp;c. illustrating the subject by these authorities. The room was crowded both evenings, and Mr. Harding was listened to with the most marked attention.</p>

The reading room, classes, and lectures, all of which had been active operation daring the past year, next came under review, and the assistance of friends in the library department earnestly asked for, the books now possessed by the society having been purchased out of the limited funds of the society. …</p>

Under these circumstances he could do little more than express the interest felt in the society, and the pleasure with which he had listened to the report that evening.</p>

<p>The Rev. J.

It is, however, to another arrangement of the reverend gentleman to which we would now direct the attention of our readers. Every Wednesday evening there is service conducted nearly as follows— The National Anthem is sung, after which Mr. Knapp reads a well-digested summary of Indian news, and afterwards reads and expounds some portion of Scripture ; a hymn is then sung, and the meeting is dismissed. We congratulate Mr. Knapp upon his triumphant success ; such gatherings are in every way useful, and calculated to do more good than the issuing of 50,000 such tracts, as “Portsmouth in Flames.” On Wednesday last not less than 2,000 persons were present, chiefly of the class for which the service was established. We trust the reverend gentleman will persevere in his truly Christian labours. <em>West Sussex Gazette.</em></p>

<p>PORTSMOUTH SOLDIERS’ INSTITUTE.</p>
<p>The annual meeting of the friends and supporters of this institution was held on Monday afternoon, at the Institute, King-street, Portsmouth.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>The Chairman said, before be called upon any gentleman to move the adoption of the report, he would say a few words relative to this institution. The objects of soldiers’ institutes have now almost become household words ; they were so well known that it was scarcely necessary for him to occupy the time of the meeting in speaking of them. He would say a few words relative to the origin of this institution. About six years ago the Rev. Carus Wilson, who was noted for his great beneficence of character and for his particular love for soldiers, with a few friends, observed a great want in this garrison. He observed that although Government and the War-office had provided liberally for soldiers within the walls of the barracks, libraries, and every amusement the service could allow, yet there was still a want. If they went to London, at four o’clock in the afternoon they would see the merchants and clerks filling the omnibuses and going straight into the country for recreation. In their harbour, they saw boats full of liberty men shoving off and going on shore, and there was a sort of feeling of repulsion in the Anglo-Saxon race against remaining in a place after business hours, which he supposed extended to the barracks also. (Hear, hear.) People naturally seek to get out of sight of business for a little while, and medical men had thought that the best thing men could do, after some hours of labour, was to get sway from the place and change the scene of action. It was therefore very natural that soldiers should seek to leave their barracks and take recreation in the town. Let them see what sort of recreation there was for them. There were the gin palaces, brilliantly lighted, and the men were naturally led into these traps which were provided for them. Soldiers were rational beings; they were not more vicious than others, but they were thrust info vice from want of some proper amusement out of the barrack walls; and he thought that Carus Wilson judged very wisely when he established an institution of this sort. He (the chairman) had always been a warm supporter of this institution, and he was only sorry that he could not attend oftener than he did. Under these circumstances it was certainly surprising that this institution had not received more support from the townspeople ; because, to a great extent, they naturally lived upon the army and navy. There were, unfortunately, some who lived by their vices, and encouraged their ruin by inducing them to do wrong. There were, however, many respectable tradesmen in this place whose natural interest he should suppose it to be to adopt such institutions as this, with a view to improve the moral condition of our soldiers, by giving them recreation in this way. There were some brilliant exceptions; Mr. Emanuel had presented papers, and had been liberal in other ways ; and Messrs. Turner and others had assisted them. The chairman again called upon the tradesmen of the town to lend a helping hand, and then noticed the narrow escapes from breaking up that the society had experienced. It was a matter of encouragement that Government had promised something for a soldiers’ institute at Chatham. This gave them every hope that the first garrison in England would very shortly come under the favourable consideration of the War-office, and that through the instrumentality of their excellent Lieutenant Governor this would be very shortly brought about. It was a great pleasure to him, and the supporters of the institution, to see his lordship among them ; and they trusted that his influence would be of great advantage in encouraging soldiers to use it, and also in promoting their interest with the Government. (Applause.)</p>

<p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[On</span> <span class="pre">moving</span> <span class="pre">to</span> <span class="pre">Ventnor,]</span></code> [h]ere it was that his energetic spirit, always casting about for opportunities of doing good, was ultimately absorbed in one of the greatest works of his life -that of leavening the British army with the Gospel of salvation to an extent and by means previously unknown. The constant departure of transports from Portsmouth with the brave fellows who so nobly vindicated British honour in India, was a spectacle which stirred his inmost soul. He could not bear that they should leave their native shores, most of them probably to return no more, without some efforts being made that they might carry with them not merely a Bible in their knapsacks, but also the love of Christ in their hearts. He used to watch for the expected sailing of the troop ships , and go on board each, provided with Bibles, Testaments, and tracts, which were freely distributed, and, in general, most gratefully received . He took these opportunities of addressing the men, with the permission of their officers, in words which fell warm from his own heart upon hearts which, though brave as lions’ , were then thoughtful and tender. Many a heart-rending scene of sorrowful partings between husband and wife, parent and child, was witnessed at these times ; and many a manly and weather-beaten cheek was moistened with a tear, while he proclaimed the Gospel message of pardon and peace, and dwelt on the touching invitations of the loving and forgiving Saviour.</p>

<p>A powerful and interesting sermon was preached on Sunday last, the church of St. John, Forton, by the Rev. Carus Wilson, and a most feeling address made by the talented preacher to the Royal Marines, Light Infantry, 350 in number, about to embark for China or India. The discourse was listened to with profound attention by above 500 of the marines, and a numerous congregation. The text, which was most striking and appropriate, was taken from Titus c. 2, v. 12, 13. and 14 :— “Teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly in this present world ; looking for that blessed hope and glorious appearing of the great God our Saviour Jesus Christ, who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto himself a peculiar people, zealous of good work’s. The plain and gospel observations deduced by the preacher from these words of inspiration, cannot we hope, have failed, by the grace of God, to have made a lasting and saving impression on the minds of the brave troops about to leave their native land to fight the battles of their Queen and country ; to return, we shall trust and pray, crowned with fresh laurels of victory and success ; or, it was feelingly observed by the preacher “if the battle field should prove a grave to any having borne in mind and carried with them in their hearts the inspired words of the text, having done their duty, and faithfully fought under the banners of the great captain of their salvation, redeemed from all iniquity a Saviour’s blood—they shall rise to the life immortal, crowned with glory and honour the kingdom of heaven; angels rejoicing with them round their Saviour’s throne.” We cannot help observing that the decorous and marked attention of the Royal Marines during divine service, not only on this interesting occasion, but now for many years has given the greatest gratification to the incumbent, their respected chaplain, and the congregation in general ; but has also been noted and mentioned by strangers who hove attended divine service. Our thoughts and prayers on each returning Sabbath will be with them “with all who travel land or water,” and we trust and believe that no Sabbath day, either in deep sea or sandy shore, will be passed without thought of the good and gospel advice they have heard at St. Johns, Forton, and that their prayers will ascend to the throne of grace, with those of their anxious chaplain, and distant and wellwishing friends and congregation, at the church St. John, Forton.</p>
<p>An interesting scene took place on Tuesday morning in the field opposite the barracks, when a bible, testament, or common prayer book were distributed to each of the troops leaving for China, by the Rev. Carus Wilson, and Rev. H. Aubrey Veck, under the shade of the fine old trees on that ground ; the soldiers were also feelingly addressed the Rev, Carus Wilson.</p>

<p>A report from later in the year describes the means by which the serving men were presented with bibles offered as a <em>“joint gift of the Admiralty and the Rev. Carus W. Wilson”</em>.</p>

<p class="admonition-title">Presented with a handsome bible and prayer-book, December 1857</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000069/18571205/017/0005">Hampshire Telegraph - Saturday 05 December 1857</a></p>
<p>Gosport</p>
<p>The non-commissioned officers and men of the Royal Marines were on Friday last each presented with a handsome bible and prayer-book, at the barracks, at Forton. We are told it was a joint gift of the Admiralty and the Rev. Carus W. Wilson M.A., the reverend gentleman attending at the distribution, and writing the name of each recipient in one book, while the, Adjutant of the division wrote the man’s name in the other.Abve 500 bibles and prayer-books will have thus been distributed. The Rev. Carus Wilson has, from the kind interest he at all times manifests in the welfare of the Royal Marines, become a great favourite with them, and this will, no doubt, increase his popularity.</p>
</div>
<p>As well as the bible and prayer books, Carus Wilson also wrote to soldiers serving in India.</p>
<div class="dropdown admonition">
<p class="admonition-title">A correspondence begins, <em>Memoir</em>, 1860</p>
<p><em><a class="reference external" href="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=DQ5hAAAAcAAJ">Brief memoir of the late Rev. W. Carus-Wilson</a>, reprinted by permission from “The Christian Observer” … With extracts from letters to soldiers in India, etc.</em> 1860</p>
<p>These efforts for the spiritual good of the soldiers, and the numerous individual acquaintances which Mr. Carus-Wilson was led to make among the men, opened a new and most important field of labour. The interest he had felt in his humble friends at Portsmouth did not cease when they more than ever needed his counsels and prayers amidst the din and dangers of the Indian mutiny. He followed them with his letters, and with little tracts written expressly for their benefit, which were sent over by tens of thousands, to be forwarded to all the regiments on service in Bengal and North-west India. In this way a correspondence was set on foot with about two hundred men, in different regiments, to each of whom Mr. Carus-Wilson regularly wrote every month. The letters received in reply were often such as to fill his heart to overflowing with joy and praise. Many of the poor fellows he had befriended and counselled looked upon him as their spiritual father ; and, while tasting in their own souls the power and sweetness of the grace of God, they delighted in recounting to him the signs of a saving change among their comrades, and of their progress and growth in grace.</p>
</div>
<p>That same year, Carus Wilson also preached in support of local schools, and chaired at least one meeting of a local bible group.</p>

<p>GOSPORT. On Sunday last two sermons were preached by the Rev. W. Carus Wilson, M.A., in the Church of St. John the Evangelist, Forton, in aid of the Infant and Girls’ Schools of that district. The sermons were most appropriate, and were listened to with the deepest attention by crowded congregations. Every heart seemed impressed by the saving truths so earnestly delivered to them. The text in the morning was taken from the 5th chapter of St. John, 40th verse, “ And ye will not come Me, that ye might have Life.” In the evening the text was taken from the 6th chapter of St. John, the latter part of the 37th verse, “And him that cometh unto Me, will in no wise cast out.” The collections were most liberal, amounting to £15 8s. The appropriate anthem, from the Collect for the 14th Sunday after Trinity, composed by the late ever to be regretted organist, Mr. Thomas Cooper, was solemnly and sweetly performed by the organist and choristers, as well the usual choral services of the church.</p>
<p>On Monday evening last the Gosport Auxiliary to the British and Foreign Bible Society held its annual meeting the Town Hall, when the chair was taken by the Rev. W. Carus Wilson, M.A., and T. Johnstone Bourne, Esq. one of the society’s domestic agents, attended as a deputation. Several reverend gentlemen surrounded the chairman, and many of them, together with the chairman, addressed the meeting, which was more numerous than has been known in this town before. The room was tastefully decorated with flags and literally crowded with auditors, all of whom appeared highly gratified. The meeting was kept up with spirit till 10 o’clock. The collection was liberal.</p>

<p>Carus Wilson’s support for, and interest in, the lives of the wives and families of the soldiers was also evident.</p>

<p class="admonition-title">The paramount duty of attending to the wants of the families left behind, August 1857</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0001365/18570822/065/0005">Portsmouth Times and Naval Gazette - Saturday 22 August 1857</a></p>
<p>To the Editor of the Portsmouth Times and Naval Gazette.</p>
<p>Sir, —You will, I am sure, readily make your columns available for the purpose of urging on your readers the present paramount duty of attending to the wants of the families left behind by our brave soldiers embarked for India. It is as little as we can do out of gratitude them for all they are doing for us, and I must add, out of gratitude to God, for our own distinguished mercy in being permitted to enjoy the peace and comfort of our own homes, to consider the poor families as specially bequeathed to our sympathies.</p>
<p>I know of heart-rending cases in Portsmouth at this moment, e.g. a sergeant’s wife, with seven children, the youngest just born; two other tidy, respectable women, with four children each, at a loss what to do or where to go, but most anxious for any kind of work, the babe of one at the breast evidently pining for want of necessary nourishment.</p>
<p>At all events, let us cheer our poor soldiers under the heavy anxieties which press upon them, on account of those they have left behind, by letting them see that we are doing all we can to supply their lack.</p>
<p>I do hope that a committee will be formed in Portsmouth to prosecute this work without delay. I am thankful to know that it is contemplated to take up houses, and arrange them for the families at a trifling rent, a plan which has answered admirably for the soldiers families at Parkhurst.</p>
<p>I need not suggest what should be done. Let public feeling and interest be properly turned to the subject, and means won’t be wanting to meet the exigencies of the case.</p>
<p>Yours faithfully, W. CARUS WILSON.</p>
<p>Eglinton House, Ventnor, Aug. 13.</p>

<p>On the island, Carus Wilson was also engaged in fundraising for the soldiers’ wives, although it appears with little immediate success.</p>

<p class="admonition-title">A public meeting, held at the Victoria-rooms (Ryde), November 1857</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000170/18571107/009/0003">Isle of Wight Observer - Saturday 07 November 1857</a></p>
<p>At a public meeting, held at the Victoria-rooms, on the 18th September, the Rev. W. Carus Wilson (late rector of Casterton, in Cumberland) stated that a great amount of distress prevailed amongst the families of the British soldiers now on their way to India. His appeal was responded to by a collection of £8 after the meeting, and subsequently by larger contributions at the banks and libraries. A ladies’ working party made up materials for clothing for the wives and children of soldiers, of which the cost was £10; a further sum of £3 3s. was expended behalf of the distressed wife and family of a soldier; and balance of £45 0s. 3d. was paid into the Portsmouth bank to the credit of the committee, who are there vigilantly and prudently meeting the wants of the families of our brave soldiers, and so relieving the minds of the gallant men of the heaviest care which could follow to their distant sphere of duty.</p>
</div>
<p>The following report of the same event is perhaps more noteable for the tone of its author, who appears to have taken umbrage about not having been informed of the event in advance of it. A certain amount of contempt for Carus Wilson is also clearly evident, as is the joy taken in the apparent lack of success of the event.</p>

<p class="admonition-title">On (not) raising funds for the benefit of soldiers’ wives, September 1857</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000170/18570926/018/0003">Isle of Wight Observer - Saturday 26 September 1857</a></p>
<p>MEETINGS AT THE VICTORIA ROOMS. A meeting was held (so we understand, as we had no intimation of it sent to our office, and consequently knew nothing of it until it was over) on Friday evening last for the important purpose of assisting the funds raised for the benefit of soldiers’ wives, 300 of whom are left behind in Portsmouth alone, to starve upon the Government pittance of sixpence a-day, while their husbands are fighting India, and covering themselves with renown, and renown will be their only reward. The meeting, we believe, was held under the auspices of the Rev. Carus Wilson, the gentleman who created such a sensation in Newport sometime ago upon the question of prostitution amongst soldiers in Parkhurst garrison. Suffice it to say that the organisation of the meeting was a decided failure, the collection after it did not amount to more than about eight pounds; which, after deducting expenses, will leave but little for the object intended. Mr. Wilson’s propensity of disregarding public opinion unfortunately not only recoils upon himself but upon those poor miserables who stand in need of help; for is it not preposterous to suppose that £8 is the money representation of the sympathy of Ryde for such a purpose ? Why was not the meeting called by requisition to the Chairman of the Ryde Commissioners (the only corporate body we have), and thus made a town affair, and proper advertisements previously issued to acquaint all the influential and wealthy classes of the subject? We should not have made these remarks had we not perceived by the constant complaints of a contemporary that the disregard shewn towards the Press in Ryde must be the result of design; because, as far as we are personally concerned, we take this view: if any individual or body of individuals underrate our influence or impugn our motives, be it so, for it will not hurt us. Nevertheless, after the legitimate channels of information have been neglected, let no surprise arise if barren results follow.</p>
<p>Another meeting was held on Monday evening (but, as in the former case, we were not apprised of it), the object of which was to assist the funds of the London Missionary Society, through the medium of lecture, illustrated by a panorama of the missionary fields, and with specimens the produce the countries where stations are appointed. The lecture, we hear, was highly interesting, and those spacious rooms were crowded on the occasion. The amount collected, however, was very meagre, being only about £6.</p>
</div>
<p>Carus Wilson also seems to have been supportive of community events on the mainland, as the following example of a New Year’s tea party for wives and children shows.</p>

<p>The Rev. Carus Wilson, and the Soldiers’ Wives.— On Monday a tea party under the superintendence and the expense of the Rev. Carus Wilson, was given to the wives and children located in Portsmouth, of soldiers serving in India, in the schoolroom of Colewort Barracks. There were between eighty and ninety women, and about 160 children present. After tea, which consisted of a plentiful supply of bread and batter, cake, &amp;c., the rev. gentleman addressed the party in a very kind and appropriate speech, referring particularly to the affairs in India, and exhorting them to put their trust in their best Friend, who is always ready comfort and assist them. On the party breaking up about seven o’clock, Mr. Wilson presented each woman with half a pound of tea, and a proportionate quantity of sugar. One of the women thanked the rev. gentleman for his kindness to them, not only on that occasion, but ever since their husbands left for India, and we are sure no thanks were ever more truly deserved. The band of the Royal Artillery was in attendance, and several ladies and gentlemen were present, amongst others the Rev. E. and Mrs. Milner, the Rev. Mr. Windsor, Sir Harry Varney, Bart, M. P. Mr. Wheatey, Colonel end Mrs. Travers, R.A. Mrs. Ozendon.</p>

<p>A New Year’s Party to the Soldiers’ Wives. — On Monday afternoon a tea party, consisting of all the soldiers’ wives whose husbands are serving with the army in India, with their children, numbering in all between eighty and ninety women, and about 160 children, assembled at Portsmouth, at the invitation and expense of the Rev. W. Carua Wilson, in the schoolroom of the Colenut Barracks. Several ladies and gentlemen were present, including the Rev. E. and Mrs. Milner, the Rev. Mr. Windsor, Sir Harry Varney, Bart, M.P. Mr. Wheatly, Colonel and Mrs. Travers, R.A., Mrs. Oxendon, and sundry other influential ladies and gentlemen ; the band of the Royal Artillery stationed at Portsmouth attended. About four o’clock the children sat down to tea, and the women about an hour afterwards, each party to a comfortable repast of bread and butter, cake, &amp;c. After tea the Rev. Carus Wilson addressed the party in a speech very approriate to the occasion, on matters in which they were highly interested, namely, the affairs in India, and exhorted them to turn to their best Friend, who is at all times ready and willing to assist them. The women appeared highly interested, and well satisfied with the discourse of the rev. gentleman, and after enjoying a few airs from the band, they separated about seven o’clock. On parting the Rev. Carus Wilson presented each woman with half a pound of tea and a proportionate quantity of sugar. Mrs. ————, 19th Regiment, on the part of the whole present, rose and returned thanks to the rev. gentleman for the handsome manner in which they had been treated, not only on the present occasion, but ever since they had had the misfortune to be separated from their husbands.</p>
