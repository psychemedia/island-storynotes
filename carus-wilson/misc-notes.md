The Contagious Diseases Acts were introduced in the 1860s for the compulsory examination of women believed to be common prostitutes for their hospitalisation (known as lock hospitals or lock wards) should they be diagnosed suffering from a contagious disease within the meaning of the Acts. The Acts were in reaction to fears that service men were vulnerable to infection from associating with prostitutes and that the Acts would apply to garrison towns and naval ports frequented by prostitutes. The Act of 1864 (27 and 28 Victoria C85) identified the following towns falling within the remit of the Act: Chatham, Colchester, Cork, Curragh, Portsmouth, Plymouth, Shorncliffe, Woolwich. The Act of 1866 (29 and 30 Victoria C96) added Canterbury, Devonport, Dover, Gravesend, Maidstone, Southampton and Winchester. The Act of 1873 did not stipulate particular towns or areas.
