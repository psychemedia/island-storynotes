Leeds Mercury - Saturday 23 May 1857

CHARLOTTE BRONTE. TO THE EDITORS OF THE LEEDS MERCURY. GENTLEMEN,-On Saturday last, you published, by request of Mr. W. W. Carus Wilson, an extract from a review, coutaining, he says, "a complete answer to the statements regarding his father's charitable institutions."

The statements referred to are, I presume, the following: that the unhealthy situation of Cowan Bridge, unwholesome food, and exposure to cold, &c., enfeebled the girls and pre-disposed them to disease; that fever broke out among them; that about forty of them suffered from it; that the surgeon, who was called in, condemned the girls' daily food by the expressive action of spitting out a portion of it which he had taken in order to taste it; that the school was removed to a new situation and a committee of management appointed.

Now let us examine the "Complete answer," and see how these charges are disposed of. And first, the reviewer assumes that these statements rest solely on the testimony " of one who, when but a child of nine, left the establishment." A reference, however, to "The Life of Charlotte it Bronte," will show that this is a *false* assumption. He praises the situation of the school, " on Mr. Carus Wilson's property, half a mile from Casterton-hall, high and healthy ;" but he has not the candour to state that this description applies to the present site, and *not to that referred to in " Jane Eyre."*

He eulogises Mr. Wilson's liberality, but omits to state that funds are raised from the public for the support of the establishment, which Mr. W. W. Carus Wilson modestly calls his " father's charitable institutions."

He makes *no mention whatever* of the condemnation of the food by the medical gentleman, of the fever which scourged the school, and the consequent change of site, and reformation of the establishment.

But, surely, the lady superintendent, " whose able letter appeared in a review," will supply the gentleman's omissions, and in her "long and complete answer to the assertions in Jane Eyre," make some reference to this eventful period in the existence of " the clergy daughters' school." She does no such thing, at least as quoted in the review.

She eulogises Mr. Wilson; asseverates her own impartiality; refers to her apostasy from her Church, and expatriation from her country; makes a somewhat erroneous statement respecting Mr. Brontte's family; hazards some conjectures about the intentions of the author of "Jane Eyre ;" and lays before us a bill of fare at Cowan Bridge- "meat, vegetables, and puddings daily in abundance." Very good, Madam! but what about the cooking that spoiled these provisions; boiled the puddings in unclean water; compounded the Saturday's nauseous mess from the fragments accumulated in a dirty larder during the week; and too often sent up the porridge, not merely burnt, but with offensive fragments of other substances discoverable in it?

The Reviewer says " the whole of this letter Mrs. Gaskell must have seen, as she quotes one sentence out of it word for word." Whether Mrs. Gaskell has seen this letter, I do not know; but if the Reviewer will refer to " The Life," vol. i., page 78, he will find that Mrs. Gaskell quotes from a letter which she had herself received from the same lady, who evidently in both instances used the same form of expression—identical, however, in only *three* words, " bright, clever. little"—in reference to the same child. May I not justly retort the charge of disingenuousness on the Reviewer; who must have known this, when he accused Mrs. Gaskell of making a garbled quotation?

" Jane Eyre" was published in 1847; Lowood was almost immediately identified with Cowan Bridge, yet " The Lady who was superintendent in 1824" was discreetly silent for more than seven years, until, in fact, the author was laid in her grave. So were Mr. W. W. Carus Wilson and the Reviewer, for aught I know. Their present proceedings are merely an illustration of a very old fable. To the day of her death " Currer Bell" maintained than the picture drawn in "Jane Eyre" was, on the whole, a true Picture of Cowan-bridge school, as she knew it by experience; that the institution was subsequently greatly improved she knew, and stated in the same work, in which she exposed its former mismanagement.

I am told that the Reviewer, referred to in this letter, has, with *exquisite taste* and *great charity*, alluded to the closing hours of my wife's life, describing them as painful. *Painful* indeed they were, but not in *his* sense of the term. On this subject I would say to him, " Who art thou that judgest another? Judge not that ye be not judged. First cast out the beam out of thine own eye ; and then shalt thou see clearly to pull out the mote that is in thy brother's eye."

Trusting to your sense of justice to give this letter a place in your Saturday's impression,

I am, Gentlemen, your obedient servant,

A. B. NICHOLLS. Haworth Parsonage, May 20th, 1857.

Leeds Mercury - Thursday 28 May 1857

CHARLOTTE BRONTE. TO THE EDITORS OF THE LEEDS 3MERCURY. GENTLEMEN,— If you will allow me a reply to a letter from Mr. Nicholls, in yesterday's* Manchester Times* and to-day's *Leeds Mercury*, it shall be my last, and very brief. Mr. Nicholls is quite welcome to the "burnt pudding" fact, and to the testimony of the pupil who may, from a delicate constitution, have been as unfit as the Brontës were for any school. I cannot defend an isolated case of "wet feet," &c., in any school. But it is the charge of "bad and insufficient food" being a *general* thing that I am prepared to prove false by ten testimonies to every one Mr. Nicholls can show to the contrary.

That the school was removed at once in consequence of the fever and unhealthly site, as Mr. Nicholls states, is quite false. It was not removed till ten years after.

I could enter far more into detail had I space, but will conclude with the following extract out of a letter from my father to me.

"I can most truly say that every charge is false. Having suffered once myself at a school from bad food, I was specially sensitive on this polnt when I established the Cowan-bridge school. Often, when quite unexpected, have I sat down at meals with the pupils, and looked into the kitchen. As to my 'lecturing the children on the sin of caring for carnal things when the bad state of the food was represented to me,' I can positively declare that no complaint was *ever* made to me, neither did I ever see one cause for any complaint."

Let me tell Mr. Nicholls that his wife's sweeping and slanderous charges against my father and his institutions have been quite as painful to some, as the refutation of them has been to himself. Yours respectfully,  
W. W. CARUS WILSON. Weston-super-Mare, June 2.

Leeds Intelligencer - Saturday 30 May 1857

CHARLOTTE BRONTE. TO THE EDITOR OF THE INTELLIGENCER. Sir, —

If the Rev. Nicholls will refer to the refutation which in your paper of last Saturday he endeavours to answer, he will see that the reviewer particularly stated that he wished there had been space to have inserted *all* the letters of the lady who was over the Cowan Bridge School when Charlotte Bronte was there. In a former letter to you, the statements of the " half-starved" condition of the pupils were disposed of. If you will kindly give me room, I will quote for your readers that part of the letter which bears on the subject Mr. Nicholls says has been evaded, viz., the fever, and the spoiling of food. During the spring of 1825 a low fever, though not an alarming one (Mr. Nicholls says "it scourged the school") prevailed, and the managers naturally anxious to know if any local cause occasioned it asked the doctor's opinion of the food that happened to be on the table. I recollect he spoke rather scornfully of a baked rice pudding, but as the ingredients were rice, sugar, and milk, its effect could hardly have been so serious as have been affirmed. I thus furnish you with the simple fact from which these statements have been manufactured. I have not the least hesitation in saying that the comforts were as many, and the privations as few, at Cowan Bridge, as can well be found in so large an establishment. How far young and delicate children are able to contend with the necessary evils of a public school, is in my opinion a very grave question, and does not enter into the present discussion. Then again, "thoughtless servants will spoil food even in private families." In addition to the above, my father has denied the accounts in " Jane Eyre," and declared he was most particular about the food at Cowan Bridge.

I leave your readers to form their own judgment between the testimony of this lady and my father, and a child who left the institution when but nine years old.

If there are *any* besides, perhaps a dismissed pupil or teacher, who can bear out C. Bronte's assertions, there are many more Cowan Bridge pupils who have written to me, during the last month, saying "how happy they were there, how all loved my father, how entirely false the character Mrs. Gaskell has sketched of him, and how good the food was, better (some have said) than they have got at their own homes."

Mr. Nicholls complains of the expression, "my father's charitable institution." It was my father who first established them ; had them built on his own property, collected single handed, for 30 years, all subscriptions for them, running the risk himself of their yearly support, and thereby doing for his brother clergy what no other man has done. No "committee of management was formed" till about six years ago, when ill-health obliged my father to live abroad. Mr. Nicholls also complains that in the refutation no mention is made of funds being raised yearly for the schools, and of their removal to Casterton. Both these facts are well known, and sufficiently attended to in the review. Mr. Nicholls is surprised that no defence was made on the publication of "Jane Eyre." But that was a novel, and persons and places were not publicly and certainly identified till the obituary notices of the press in 1855, and the Memoir of C. Bronte appeared. It was in 1855 that the letter of refutation was sent to review, by the lady who was over Cowan Bridge School when C. Bronte was there ; who from conscientious motives left the Church of England, and who married the head of a college, in America, which Mr. Nicholls charitably calls " Apostacy and expatriation." It is only natural that Mr. Nicholls should seek to defend his wife's assertions ; but considering that to add force to her fiction, she first cast odium on an invaluable institution, and a public benefactor to mankind, which, as Mrs. Gaskell says, she often regretted, I think Mr. Nicholls should be the first to share in that regret, and to repair the great injury that has been done.

Yours, W. W. CARUS WILSON.  
Weston-super-Mare, May 25th.

Usk Observer - Saturday 30 May 1857

The publication of the life of CHARLOTTE BRONTE, and the charges contained in it against the Cowen-bridge School has led to a good deal of angry feeling. The Rev. H. Shepheard, M.A., late Fellow and Tutor of Oriel College, Oxford, Incumbent of Casterton, and Chaplain and Secretary of the Clergy Daughters' School, in a letter in Wednesday's *Times*, defends the school, which he says " has been carried on since 1833 at Casterton, and, to borrow the words of a Preston paper the vile attack made on the rev. gentleman (Mr. Carus Wilson) has reference to the Clergy Daughters' Schools; and, in consequence of what is said on the subject in the Bronte memoirs, some ignorant reviewers of the public press in London have arrived at the conclusion that at Cowen-bridge, or Casterton, " there exists," as observes the editor of the Lancaster Gazette, "a sort of Dotheboys' Hall. In this neighbourhood the interesting establishments alluded to are well known, and we can only smile at the verdancy of our London contemporaries," &c.' Now, sir, in the visitors' book of the Casterton school there appears the name of 'Mrs. Gaskill' as having visited the institution in March, 1856. She was shown over the whole house, saw the pupils, and expressed nothing but satisfaction. Would it not have been, then, an act of bare justice, as well an ingenuous and graceful acknowledgment, on her part, to have inserted in her memoir a frank avowal that whatever may have been the merits or demerits of the Cowen-bridge School of 1824, the Casterton School of 1856 presented before her own eyes a spectacle of health and comfort in the pupils, and a result of generous large-hearted benevolence in the founder, such as might well bring upon him, not calumny and vituperation, but blessings and gratitude? Such an avowal is indispensably required on Mrs. Gaskill's part, if she desires to relieve herself from the charge of conduct which I do not choose to characterise. Her own mind evidently has its misgivings as to the truth of the alleged facts even of the Cowen-bridge story.

Leeds Mercury - Tuesday 02 June 1857

CHARLOTTE BRONTE. TO THE EDITORS OF THE LEEDS MERCURY.

GENTLEMEN,— Will you kindly allow me to thank Mr. W. W. Carus Wilson for his last letter?

In his former statement all was perfection at Cowan Bridge; *now* we have the following points *admitted*:— That "during the spring of 1825 there prevailed a low fever, although not an alarming one" (what *would* alarm Mr. W. if the illness of about forty girls failed to produce that effect?); that " the doctor rather scornfully condemned" the girls' food; that "the servants thoughtlessly spoiled" it; that there were "privations;" that the schools were removed to a new situation—from. what cause Mr Wilson does not say.

But mark how easily Mr. Wilson disposes of any adverse testimony: "If there *are* any besides, perhaps a dismissed pupil or teacher."

Even at the risk of incurring such a summary dismissal, I cannot forbear giving him the following extract from a letter, which I have received from a former pupil at Cowan Bridge: merely premising that I fear it will tax even his ingenuity to rank the lady under either category:—

" On first reading 'Jane Eyre,' several years ago, I recognised immediately the picture there drawn, and was far from considering it in any way exaggerated: in fact, I thought at the time, and still think, the matter rather understated than otherwise. I suffered so severely from the treatment that, I was never in the school-room during the last three months I was there, until about a week before I left; and was considered to be far gone in a consumption. My mother (whose only child I was) was never informed of my illness, and I might certainly have died there without her being informed of it, had not a severe illness of her own caused her hastily to summon me home. She was so shocked at my appearance that she refused to allow me to return, though pressed to do so. It was some time before my constitution recovered the blow it then received. I attributed my illness to the unhealthy situation of the school, the long walks to church in bad weather (for in winter our feet were often wet during the whole of the service), and the scanty and ill-prepared food. The housekeeper was very dirty with the cooking—I have frequently seen grease swimming on the milk and water we had for breakfast, in consequence of its having been boiled in a greasy copper; and I perfectly remember having once been sent for a cup of tea for a teacher who was ill in bed, and no teaspoon being at hand, the housekeeper stirred it with her finger—she being engaged in cutting raw meat at the time. Our food was almost always badly cooked and besides that, we certainly had not enough of it, whatever may be said to the contrary. * * * In a word, the system at Cowan Bridge was a very harsh one, and I was very glad to hear that an improvement took place after the School was removed to Casterton, for it was much needed. I had no knowledge whatever of Mrs. Nicholls personally, and therefore my statement may fairly be considered an impartial one. You are quite welcome to make what use you think proper of this letter."

If Mr. Wilson's friends had confined themselves to a legitimate review of Mrs. Gaskell's work, I should never have written a line on this subject ; but when they attacked the dead, and adopted the questionable course of disseminating their vile slander anonymously through the post-office (actually sending a copy to Mr. Brontë), I should, indeed, have been inexcusable if I had allowed their assertions to pass unchallenged .

Mr. W. W. Carus Wilson published a refutation, as he calls it; I have shown that it was nothing of the sort. To bandy further statements with him I have neither time nor inclination ; besides, I am quite sure that both you and your readers would soon be as tired of us and our discussion as the poor girls were of their burnt porridge with "mixture as before."

Apologising for again trespassing on your valuable space,  
I am, Gentlemen, your obedient servant,  
A. B. NICHOLLS.  
Haworth Parsonage, May 29th, 1857.

Leeds Intelligencer - Saturday 06 June 1857

CHARLOTTE BRONTE. TO THE EDITOR OF THE INTELLIGENCER.

Sir,— I was aware that the reviewer had expressed the wish referred to by Mr. Wilson; and I now see that, while inserting all that was favourable to management at the school, he carefully omitted whatever was told against it.

Let me, however, thank Mr. W. W. Carus Wilson for his last letter. In his former communications to you all was perfection at Cowan Bridge, now have the following points *admitted*: —That during ...


ALSO:

P.S. Will Mr. W. W. Carus Wilson give the *maiden name* of the superintendent who "married the head of a college in America"? For, if she is, as I suspect, *most intimately* acquainted with the "Miss Scatcherd" of "Jane Eyre," there is a strong reason why she should wish to disparage the testimony of the avenging sister of "Helen Burns" (Maria Bronte), who was so cruelly treated by the *amiable* lady.


THE LETTER IS THEN DIRECTLY FOLLOWED BY THE ONE FROM W. W. CARUS WILSON THAT APPEARS IN Leeds Mercury - Thursday 28 May 1857.

THEN FOLLOWS:

A long letter, in defence of the Clergy Daughters' School and Mr. Carus Wilson, from the allegations made by C. Bronte, and repeated by Mrs. Gaskill, appeared in *The Times* on Wednesday. It was signed H. Shepheard, M. A., late Fellow and Tutor of Oriel College, Oxford, incumbent of Casterton, and Chaplain and Secretary of the Clergy Daughters' School, and dated Casterton, May 25. It concluded as follows:—

In plain English, Charlotte Bronte's own account of Cowanbridge is not to be trusted: and, indeed, how should it be so? She wrote, after the lapse of 20 years, of what came under her notice at eight or nine years of age, and, besides the misty dimness of recollections so distant, who does not know the microscopic effect upon the mind of a child, by which molehills are magnified into mountains, men into giants, and trifles into serious troubles?

And yet, Sir, upon such dreamy recollections and self-condemned fictions Charlotte Bronte's biographer has ventured to hold up to public execration an admirable institution, and to vilify a great and good man, whose whole life, now verging towards three score years and ten, has been one continuous refutation of such slanders, the single-minded and self-denying devotedness, remarkable even in these days of active benevolence, with which he has lived for one sole object—the good of his fellow-creatures!

The Clergy Daughters' School is a public institution, open to public inspection; and all who desire to know the truth are invited, as the best possible test, to visit the school itself; the horrors of starvation will be pleasantly dissipated by a burst of merriment from 100 round and rosy-cheeked girls, and their better feelings, I trust, raised in thankfulness to Him " from whom all good counsels and all just works do proceed," while they gaze upon the fruits of Mr. Carus Wilson's faithful labours, and bear the love and veneration felt for one whose name will be remembered with gratitude by children's children, long alter his calumniators are forgotten.

As regards the fever which broke out in the school, I have evidence that it existed in the village at the same time, and may, therefore, very probably have been communicated to the school by infection ; at any rate, the fact destroys Mrs. Gaskell's assumption that it was caused by the bad food of the institution. And the same witness, an inmate of the school during the fever, and one who remembers the little Brontes there, can testify that, so far from the fever being " aggravated by the cruelty" of the managers, every possible care was taken of the invalids; wine and everything else recommended by the medical attendant, were liberally supplied, and not one child was attacked who did not recover. The only " cruelty" connected with the event is the cruelty of imputing unfeeling conduct to those who were doing their best to alleviate a Providential visitation, and who were spending and being spent in a great and benevolent and arduous undertaking for the good of others.

It will not do, sir, for bookmakers to seize upon the characters of public institutions or private persons as so much literary capital "To point a moral adorn a tale." The claim of character to be respected is a sacred right; and the disregard of it (to use your own forcible words) is "a species of criminality which is shamefully neglected in the statutes of the realm." Mr. Carus Wilson, indeed, can well afford smile of pity for his assailants, and will, I am sure, desire no other revenge upon them than to return them good for evil and blessing for railing. It would occupy too much of your space to answer all Mrs. Gaskell's opprobrious remarks in detail, though I have the means of disproving, point by point, more than one of her alleged facts; but I will conclude these observations with an extract from a letter lately received from a former pupil of Cowan-bridge, as a testimony to the general character both of Mr. Wilson and the school:—

On leaving school I was questioned on the subject by friends, one of whom has lately said that my testimony at that time was, what it is now, that the bread, milk, meat, vegetables, &c., were of the best quality, and that we always had as much as we wished for.' While at school I do not think I ever heard any complaints about the diet among the girls. I must say that nothing could exceed the care and kindness which watched over us ; the wants of each individual child were attended to; the slightest ailment or indisposition was brought under the particular notice of the superintendent, and was sure to receive every attention. While I was at Cowan-bridge no sick child could have been treated as Maria Bronte is said to have been by a teacher, &c. They (the teachers) were, as a body, animated by a high sense of responsibility, joined to a feeling of affectionate interest in the girls, generally speaking.

"I cannot express the indignation with which I have read the character of Mr. Wilson, described by Mrs. Gaskeil. It is very plain that she never knew him, or she never could have spoken of him in such terms. ... Oh, no; I never saw in Mr. Wilson 'spiritual pride,'' love of power,' or 'want of tenderness' in his treatment of us. He never wounded our feelings by any illusion to our dependent position ; this is altogether a false representation of his conduct towards us. ... It would be a great comfort to me if I could anything to clear the school and its generous founder of the calumnies published against them by one who never knew either."

The writer of this letter allows me to publish her name if necessary. She is one whose name would add weight to her testimony, and whose worth would be attested by high and noble witnesses. I could add abundance more of extracts, did space permit; but I hope enough has been said to throw light upon the real nature of the case. The public will their opinion both of Mr. Wilson and his assailants.

Westmorland Gazette - Saturday 30 May 1857

"JANE EYRE" AND "CHARLOTTE BRONTE"

To the Editor of the Westmorland Gazette.

Sr,— Prominent notice has been taken recently by the press of the "Life of Chariotte Bronte," authoress of " Jane Eyre," and the charges brought against the Cowan Bridge School, and its founder the Rev. Wm. Carus Wilson, have been in some instances adopted and commented upon is if they were true.

I trust that a love of justice will engage you to give publcity to the following remarks on the other side.

I am willing to hope that neither Charlotte Bronte herself, nor her biographer, had any intention of injuring either the Clergy Daughters School or Mr. Carus Wilson. It is indeed, difficult to believe that these writers could be guilty of so wanton an attack upon public benevolence and private charater. But the injury is not less real because it is undesigned. And it is only bare justice to this excellent institution and its benevolent founder that the false impressions created by these books should be counteracted by a contradiction as widely disseminated, if possible, as the calumnies themselves.

The charges made against Mr. Carus Wilson and the school either directly and by name, or by implication with the " Lowood " establishment in "Jane Eyre," are chiefly these — That the pupils were half-starved, the food provided for them being bad and insufficient — that they were treated with habitual neglect and want of feeling — that the low fever which broke out among them caused principally by the bad food, and aggravated by the cruelty of those at the head of the establishment — that the two elder sisters of Charlotte Bronte sunk under this treatment, and that Charlotte Bronte herself suffered her whole life long in health from it – that Mr. Carus Wilson's character was deformed by "spiritual pride," " want of tenderness," and long list of other unsightly excrescences.

Now, Sir, in answer to all this, I am prepared to produce good evidence and proof, that in the whole mass of the foregoing charges *there is not one word of truth*. I am compelled by the force of testimony now in my possession to believe that the promulgator of such falsehoods has received her information from those who were either ignorant of the real facts, or *disposed*, from wrong motives, to distort and misrepresent them. The testimony I have myself been able to collect, respecting events which happened more than thirty years ago, is furnished by those who were inmates of the establishment before, during, and after, the residence of the little Brontes within its walls.

The account given by Charlotte Bronte's biographer of the School and Mr. Carus Wilson is full of inaccuracies as to minor details of fact — not of much moment in themselves, but sufficient to show that her sources of information were not to be relied on. Whether the little Brontes were fit subjects for a school education is a different question altogether. The two younger children, Charlotte and Emily, "enjoyed uniformly good health" at Cowan Bridge. But Maria and Elizabeth, the former of whom is represented as the principal victim of the Cowan Bridge cruelties, in the character of " Helen Burns," were clearly not in a fit state of health to be sent to any school at all. They " were not strong enough when they came, having only just recovered from a complication of measles and hooping-cough; indeed I suspect they had scarcely recovered," &c. These are Mrs. Gaskell's own words; and she informs us moreover, that their mother died of internal cancer. These two children died of consumption inherent in a diseased constitution; and who can wonder at such a result, with such a constitution, after reading Mrs. Gaskell's own description of the *potato diet* of their own home — "the *cold damp arising from the fag floors and passages*" of Haworth Parsonage — the bleak moors, long winters, and bitter blasts of the rude climate, where, "often, on autumnal or winter nights, the four winds of heaven seemed to meet and rage together, tearing round the house as they were wild beasts striving find an entrance." Let any reasonable man say whether Mrs. Gaskell has not herself here described disease and hardship enough in the comfortless and cheerless home of their infancy to account for the early death of these two poor children, without imputing blame to the Cowan Bridge authorities for neglect and cruelty.

The testimony of an eye witness that Charlotte and Emily "*enjoyed uniformly good health* " the school, is a sufficient refutation of Mrs Gaskell's statement that " Charlotte suffered her whole life long, in heart and body, from the consequences of what happened there."

It may, Sir, answer the purpose of novel writers and book makers to write pathetic descriptions of scenes of suffering, and pungent satires on personal character but if truth is disregarded, and charity forgotten, let them remember that "as a mad man casteth fire-brands, arrows, and death, so is the man that deceiveth his neighbour and saith, I not in sport?"

As regards the diet at Cowen Bridge, it would be too much to expect that either in a public institution or even a private family, there should never be an instance of food being burnt or badly cooked. But here again I have the testimony of an eye-witness that "in this respect the institution in question compares very favorably with other and more expensive schools."

But, Sir, there is another aspect of the affair. It is not only the actors and interests of thirty years ago that are touched by Mrs. Gaskell's book.

The institution begun at Cowan Bridge has been carried on since 1833 at Casterton ; and (to borrow the words of a Preston paper) " the vile attack made on the rev. gentleman (Mr. Carus Wilson) has reference to the Clergy Daughters' Schools, and in consequence of what is said on the subject in the Bronte memoirs, some ignorant reviewers of the public press in London have arrived at the conclusion that at Cowan Bridge, or Casterton, "there exists," as observes the Editor of the *Lancaster Gazette*, "a sort of Dotheboys' Hall. In this neighbourhood, the interesting establishments alluded to are well known, and we can only smile at the verdancy of our London contemporaries," &c. Now, Sir, in the Visitors' Book of the Casterton School there appears the name of " Mrs. Gaskell," as having visited the institution in March, 1856. She was shewn over the whole house, saw the pupils, and expressed nothing but satisfaction. Would it not have been, then, an act of bare justice, as well as an ingenuous and graceful acknowledgment, on her part, to have inserted in her memoir a frank avowal, that whatever may have been the merits or demerits of the Cowan Bridge School of 1824, the Casterton School of 1856 presented before her own eyes a spectacle of health and comfort in the pupils, and a result of generous large hearted benevolence in the founder, such as might well bring upon him not calumny and vituperation, but blessings and gratitude? Such an avowal is indispensably required on Mrs. Gaskell's part, if she desires to relieve herself from the charge of conduct which I not choose to characterize.

Her own mind evidently has its misgivings as to the truth of the alleged facts, even, of the Cowan Bridge story. She in effect admits that Charlotte Bronte's own recollection of the facts was indistinct; falsified and exaggerated by her own vivid imagination. Let any candid person read the following extract from the Bronte memoir, and say whether it does not virtually surrender Mrs. Gaskell's whole case. "I believe she herself (Charlotte) Bronte) would have been glad of an opportunity to *correct* the overstrong impression which was made upon the public by her vivid picture, though even she, suffering her whole life long, both in heart and body, from the consequences of what happened there, might have been apt, to the last, *to take her deep belief in facts for the facts themselves — her conception of truth for the absolute truth*," (p. 64).

In plain English, *Charlotte Bronte's own account of Cowan Bridge is not to be trusted!* And indeed how should it be so ? She wrote, after the lapse of twenty years, of what came under her notice at eight or nine years of age, and besides the misty dimness of recollections so distant, who does not know the microscopic effect upon the mind of a child, by which mole-hills are magnified into mountains, men into giants, and trifles into serious troubles ?

And yet, Sir, upon such dreamy recollections and self-condemned fictions, Charlotte Bronte's biographer has ventured to hold up to public execration an admirable institution ; and to vilify a great and good man, whose whole life, now verging towards three-score years and ten, has been one continuous refutation of such slanders, by the single-minded and self-denying devotedness, remarkable even in these days of active benevolence, with which he has lived for one sole object, the good of his fellow creatures!

The Clergy Daughters' School is a public institution, open to public inspection; and all who desire to know the truth are invited, as the best possible test, to visit the school itself; their horrors of starvation will be pleasantly dissipated by a burst of merriment from a hundred round and rosy cheeked girls, and their better feelings, I trust, raised in thankfulness to Him "from whom all good counsels and all just works do proceed," while they gaze upon the fruits of Mr. Carus Wilson's faithful labours, and hear of the love and veneration felt for one whose name will be remembered with gratitude by children's children, long after his calumniators are forgotten.

As regards the fever which broke out in the school, I have evidence that it existed in the village at the same time; it may therefore very probably have been communicated to the school by infection; at any rate, the fact destroys Mrs. Gaskell's assumption that it was caused bv the bad food of the institution. And the same witness, an inmate of the school during the fever, and one who remembers the little Brontes there, can testify that so far from the fever being "aggravated by the cruelty" of the managers, every possible care was taken of the invalids; wine, and everything else recommended by the medical attendant, were liberally supplied, and not one child was attacked who did not recover. The only " cruelty" connected with the event is the cruelty of imputing unfeeling conduct those who were doing their best to alleviate a prudential visitation, and who were spending and being in a great and benevolent and arduous undertaking for the good of others.

It will not do, Sir, for bookmakers to Seize upon the characters of public institutions or private persons as so , much literary capital —  
" To moral, or adorn a tale."  

The claim of character be respected is a sacred right; and the disregard of it (to use the forcible words of the *Times* on another point) is "a species of criminality which is shamefully neglected in the statutes of the realm." Mr. Carus Wilson, indeed, can well afford a smile of pity for his assailants; and will, I am sure, desire no other revenge upon them than to return them good for evil and blessing for railing. It would occupy too much of your space to answer all Mrs. Gaskell's opprobrious remarks in detail; though I have the means of disproving, point point, more than one of her alleged facts; but I will conclude these observations with an extract from a letter lately received from a former of Cowan Bridge, as a testimony to the general character both of Mr. Wilson and the school:

" On leaving school I was questioned the subject by friends — one of whom has lately said that my testimony at that time was what it is now — that the bread, milk, meat, vegetables, &c, were of the best quality, and that we always had as much as we wished for. Whilst at school I do not think I ever heard any complaints about the diet amongst the girls. I must say that nothing could exceed the care and kindness which watched over us; the wants of each individual child were attended to; the slightest ailment or indisposition was brought under the particular notice of the superintendent, and was sure to receive every attention. Whilst I was at Cowan Bridge no sick child could have been treated as Maria Bronte is said to have been, by a teacher, &c. They (the teachers) were, as a body, animated by a high sense of responsibility joined to a feeling of affectionate interest the girls, generally speaking.

"I cannot express the indignation with which I have read the character of Mr. Wilson as described by Mrs. Gaskell. It is very plain that she never knew him, or she never could have spoken of him in such terms.

" Oh no I never saw in Mr. Wilson ' spiritual pride,' ' love of power,' or ' want of tenderness,' in his treatment of us.

" It would be a great comfort to me if I could do anything to clear the school and its generous founder from the calumnies published against them by one who never knew either."

The writer of this letter allows me to publish her name, if necessary. She is one whose name would add weight to her testimony— and whose worth would be attested by high and noble witnesses. I could add abundance more of extracts, did space permit; but I hope enough has been said to throw light upon the real nature of the case. The public will form their own opinion both of Mr. Wilson and his assailants.

I am, Sir, truly yours,  
Henry Shepheard, M.A.,  
late Fellow and Tutor of Oriel College, Oxford; Incumbent of Casterton, and Chaplain and Secretary of the Clergy Daughters' School.  
Casterton, 26th May, 1857.

"JANE EYRE" AND THE CASTERTON SCHOOLS.

Many of our readers will be aware of the controversy which has been carried on in the metropolitan and other journals, with reference to the charges brought against The Clergy Daughters' School, founded by Mr. Carus Wilson, and formerly located at Cowen Bridge, but latterly at Casterton. These charges appeared in that striking novel "Jane Eyre," and although a fictitious name was adopted, it was soon pretty well known that the Casterton school was prefigured in the Lowood establishment, and in the experience of the heroine of the book. Miss Charlotte Bronte, the talented authoress, was believed to record her own reminiscences of residence in that institution. No notice, however, was taken by Mr. Carus Wilson of these imputations at the time, but there has lately appeared a memoir of the authoress, by Mrs. Gaskell, of Manchester, in which the charges were re-produced, and the establishment and founder localised. Mr. W. Wilson then came forward to refute the calumnies which had been cast upon the institution established by his father, and the Rev. Mr. Nicholl, who married Miss Bronte subsequent to the publication of "Jane Eyre," has replied in vindication of the authenticity his late wife's statements.

Another champion has now entered on the field, in the person of the Rev. H. Shepherd, M.A., incumbent of Casterton, and chaplain and secretary of the Clergy Daughters’ School, who has addressed a letter to the *Times*, which had "adopted and commented upon the charges brought against the Cowen Bridge School and its founder, as if they were true."—From this letter we subjoin the following extracts:—

I am willing to hope that neither Charlotte Bronte herself nor her biographer had any intention of injuring either the Clergy Daughters' School or Mr. Carus Wilson. `[A substantial extract follows.]`

Lancaster Guardian - Saturday 06 June 1857

THE CASTERTON SCHOOL CONTROVERSY.

This paper warfare is still continued, though the subject is pretty nigh exhausted. The last two letters which have appeared are by Mr. Nicholls, in reply to Mr. W.W. Carus Wilson and Mr. Shepheard, incumbent of Casterton.

Mr. Nicholls, in a letter to the editor of the *Manchester Guardian*, says:—

"Will you kindly allow me to thank Mr. W. W. Carus Wilson for his last letter? We have now got the following admissions:— That 'in 183S there prevailed at Cowan Bridge low ferer, not an alarming one' (I should like to know what would alarm Mr. Wilson, if the illese of about forty girls failed to produce that effect); that 'the doctor rather scornfully' condemned the food; that ' the servants thoughtlessly spoiled' it; and that 'the schools were removed to Casterton,' from what cause Mr. Wilson does not say.

" But mark how easily Mr. W. W. Carus Wilson disposes of witnesses:—'If there are any besides, perhaps a dismissed pupil or teacher.' Even at the risk of incurring such a summary dismissal, I cannot forbear giving him the following extract from a letter which I have received from a former pupil at Cowan Bridge:—

"'On first reading 'Jane Eyre,' several years ago, I recognised immediately the picture then drawn, and was far from considering it in any way exaggerated; in fact I thought at the time, and still think, the matter rather understated than otherwise. I suffered so severely from the treatment, that I was never in the schoolroom daring the last three months I was there, until about a week before I left, and was considered to be far gone in consumption. My mother (whose only child I was) was never informed of my illness, and I might certainly have died there without her being informed of it, had not a severe illness of her own caused her hastily to summon me home. She was so much shocked at my appearance, that she refused to allow me to return, though pressed to so. I was some time before my constitution recovered the blow it then received. I attribute my illness to the unhealthy situation of the school, the long walks to church in bad weather, (for in winter our feet were often wet daring the whole of the service,) and the scanty and ill prepared food. * * * The housekeeper was very dirty. I have frequently seen grease swmimming on the milk and water we had for breakfast, in consequence of its having been boiled in a greasy copper; and I perfectly remember having once been sent for a cup of tea for teacher, who was ill in bed, and no teaspoon being to hand, the housekeeper stirred it with her finger, she being engaged in cutting raw meat at the time. I could give you scores of such instances as these, which fell under my own observation. Our food was almost always badly cooked, and besides that we certainly had not enough of it, whatever may be said to the contrary. * * * In a word the system at Cowan Bridge was a very harsh one, and I was very glad to hear that an improvement took place after the school was removed to Casterton, for it was much needed. I had no knowledge whatever of Mrs. Nicholls personally, and therefore my statement may fairly be considered an impartial one. You are quite welcome to make what use you think proper of this letter.'

"If Mr. Wilson's friends had confined themselves to legitimate review of Mrs. Gaskell's work, I should never have written a single line on this subject; but when they attacked the dead, and adopted the questionable course of disseminating their vile slander anonymously through the post-office (actually sending a copy to Mr. Bronte), I should indeed have been inexcusable if I had allowed their assertions to pass unchallenged.

"Mr. W. W. Carus Wilson publishes a refutation, as he calls it. I have shown that was nothing of the sort. To bandy farther statements with him I have neither time nor inclination; besides I am quite sore that both yon and your readers would soon be as tired of us and our discussion as the poor girls were of their burnt porridge, with "mixture as before."—Apologising for again trespassing on your valuable space, I am, sir, your obedient servant, A. B. Nicholls."

Mr. Shepheard is of course heard on the other side, in reply to a former letter by Mr. Nicholls. He says:—

" There appears to be altogether a mistake in Mr. Nicholls' mind to the reason of the Clergy Daughters' School being removed to Casterton. He speaks of " the fever that scourged the school, and the consequent change of site, and reformation of the establishment." This is total misconception, as will appear at once from a comparison dates. The fever broke out in 1825; the school was removed to Casterton in 1833 — eight years afterwards. The mere fact speaks for itself that the change of site had nothing do with the fever. This assumption is perfectly groundless as is the other, that it was for the purpose of reforming the establishment. There were obvious reasons, quite independent of the management of the school or the healthiness of the site, why it should be removed (as the Servants' School was likewise) to the spot where Mr. Carus Wilson was himself the resident minister. I have medical testimony that the situation of Cowan Bridge is not unhealthy, but well adapted for a public institution, lying on a high level, with good fall for drainage, and free from fogs and mists. It is also an incorrect statement that 40 girls were attacked by the fever. The number was 30, end they all recovered. The little Brontes escaped the infection entirely. The fever was of mild character; a circumstance which, I believe, every medical man would consider as a decided proof that the situation could not be unhealthy. For, in unhealthy situations, fevers which might otherwise be mild, are pretty sure to take on a malignant character.

"It is one of the worst features in the whole affair, that some exceptional instances of mismanagement in the subordinates at the first establishment of the school, which may really have happened, are made by tacit inference to mark its general character, and that through its whole course.

" In a recent letter to tho public journals I have admitted that there may have been instances of burnt or badly cooked food; and I have since received confirmation, from new sources, of the correctness of that admission. A correspondent writes to me:— "I fear that there must have been some grounds of complaint against the conduct of the cook, when first the school opened. It could not be expected that a new institution should be perfect in all its parts; and it is vary shocking to one's feelings that circumstances which caused Mr. Wilson so much sorrow and anxiety should be attributed to his indifference and neglect with bitter reproach."

"Just so, sir; and Mrs. Gaskell herself, to do her justice, exonerates Mr. Wilson of the charge of indifference and neglect, and rightly lays the blame on the right person—the cook; and this cook was dismissed in a few months.

"The same remark applies to the statements of harsh treatment of the pupils by a teacher. I have not been able to meet with any confirmation of these accounts; and certainly they ought to be either retracted, or authenticated producing the name of the teacher, or at least the names of eye-witnesses. But even supposing, for argument's sake, the story of 'Helen Burns's' ill-treatment to be true, it is a gross injustice and inexcusable calumny to represent the whole Cowan Bridge institution generally characterised by a spirit of harsh and hateful tyranny, on account of the conduct of one teacher at one time. There is also an implied falsehood in representing Maria Bronte under the name of Helen Burns, as having died at the school at all—for she died at her own home, and it is a still further step in calumniating, to represent these things as in any way sanctioned or tolerated by Mr. Carus Wilson, as 'Jane Eyre' unquestionably does. Would Mrs. Gaskell, or did Chariotto Bronte, venture to assert, that Mr. Carus Wilson would permit a child to be treated as Helen Burns is represented to have been? or that he would have retained in the school any teacher who had been guilty of such injustice and cruelty ? If not Mrs. Gaskell is bound, in common justice, to clear him of such odious imputations. * * * *

"While on the subject, let me point out another gross misrepresentation, Mrs. Carus Wilson and her two daughters are professedly described in "Jane Eyre" as presenting, in their fashionable dress and appearance, a revolting contrast to the plainness enforced by their husband and father's lectures in the schoolroom. It is a sufficient refutation of this disgraceful insinuation to state, that at the time C. Bronte was at Cowan Bridge, Mr. Carus Wilson's eldest daughters were scarcely out of the nursery—not girls of 16 or 17—and could not, therefore, have furnished the originals of the two Misses Brocklehurst in "Jane Eyre."

"From this one specimen of C. Bronte truthfulness, let the candid public judge of the value of her other caricatures of Cowan Bridge and its conductors.

* * * * *

"Mr.Nicholls is mistaken in supposing that the lady who wrote to Mrs. Gaskell is the same who is referred to by Mr. W. W. Carus Wilson. In short, the attacks made against the school, and Mr. Carus Wilson, both by C. Bronte and Mrs. Gaskell, are so full of misrepresentations and ignorant mistakes matters of fact, as to forfeit for the writers all reasonable claim to credit. Those who were either so ill informed, or ill disposed, deserve not even the indulgence accorded to involuntary error; for certainly they were in duty bound, before they undertook even the exposure of alleged facts by which any person's character feelings might be wounded, to use the most scrupulous care in ascertaining, and fidelity in narrating them.

"I repeat, that these sweeping charges of habitual neglect, mismanagement, and harshness at the Cowan Bridge School, are wholly unsupported by fact and unworthy of credit. And as to the personal invectives in the 'Life,' against Mr. Carus Wilson himself, there is not even a single fact so much as specified in support of them. They are a tissue of falsehoods against a man wholly unknown to the calumniator.

"Instead of falsely accusing a good man, the charity which 'covereth a multitude of sins' might have suggested that it would be more Christian to pass over in silence even real inconsistencies, had they occurred, a reflection not perhaps unsuitable for one who has used such extraordinary freedom in criticising the Christian character of others, as Mrs. Gaskell has done in the 'Life of Charlotte Bronte."—I am, sir, yours truly,  
" H. Shepheard, M.A.,  
"Incumbent of Casterton, and Chaplain and Secretary of the Clergy Daughters' School.

CHARLOTTE BRONTE.

TO THE EDITOR OF THE INTELLIGENCER.

Sir,—The lady who signs herself " A Lover of Truth" in the letter referring to the Cowen Bridge School has, I think, mistaken the purport of the refutation in your paper from the Rev. H. Shepheard and Mr. W. Carus Wilson. If Mrs. Gaskill had simply stated in her "Life" that for two or three weeks there was once a cook at Cowen Bridge who occasionally spoiled porridge, and that she was very soon dismissed, instead of giving the public the impression that the pupils were "half starved," " cruelly treated," and Mr. Carus Wilson "proud" and "unfeeling," " inconsistent," &c., there would have been no need for any defence. In common with other warmly attached pupils I can bear testimony to the *practical* kindness of Mr. Wilson's conduct, and to the kindness of the teachers as well as to the comfort and happiness all experienced there.—Yours truly,  
A Cowen Bridge Pupil in the early Years of the School.  
P.S.—I enclose my card, with full name and address.

[We hope that this letter will close all correspondence the subject.—Editor.]

CHARLOTTE BRONTE AND SILVERDALE (FROM A CORRESPONDENT.)

In one of the locel guides to Silverdale we are informed that "Charlotte Bronte was educated at Casterton, not very far away, and when fever broke out she was sent to ' The Cove,' where an apartment is still known as 'The Bronte Room.' " This statement contains one glaring inaccuracy, for Charlotte Bronte was not educated at Casterton The Clergy Daughters' School now at Casterton, was in her day at Cowan Bridge, and she left before its locality was changed. Readers of "Jane Eyre " can never forget her pictures of the life at Cowan Bridge school, and her presentation its founder, the Rev. William Carus Wilson as Mr. Brocklehurst. One of Wilson's houses was that now known as Cove House. Silverdale, but it does not seem at all likely that Charlotte would be invited there as a guest, and none of her biographers allude to any temporary removal from Cowan Bridge. Yet the tradition is very persistent, and there is certainly a " Bronte Room " in The Cove, and it is in the older part of the house. Mr. Wilson built the former church at Silverdale in 1829, and the present vicarage in 1837. In 1893 there was resident in Silverdale a lady of 80, who had been a teacher at Casterton, and did not think the imaginary Brocklehurst was too severe a picture of the real Carus Wilson. This lady mentioned the stay of Charlotte Bronte at The Cove as a matter within her knowledge, although it had happened before her connection with the school. It is, of course, possible that when the fever broke out at Cowan Bridge some of the children who had not been attacked were taken to The Cove as a place of safety. Charlotte cannot have been removed there for convalescence, none of the Brontes had the fever. Such is Mrs. Gaskell's explicit statement.

Having been recently in Silverdale, I have tried to ascertain the foundation for the local tradition. The result is not entirely satisfactory, as direct evidence, yet it is not easy to disbelieve it entirely.

Certainly one would like think that at lovely Silverdale, with its wealth of woods, and its sea breezes, Charlotte Bronte may have found some compensation for the discomforts, physical and moral, of her dreary school days at Cowan Bridge.

Hampshire Telegraph - Friday 04 September 1959

Portsmouth Link With The Brontes

PORTSMOUTH has many literary associations. Charles Dickens was born here. Conan Doyle practised as a doctor here. H. G. Wells gained his draper's apprentice experience for "Kipps" from from Southsea. So it seems almost inevitable that Portsmouth should have a link, however tenuous and unhappy, with Charlotte Bronte.

Having lived in Scarborough, with its funereal associations with Anne Sulfite, it was, for me. an exciting discovery to make when I learned I was stall living in a place which could claim some faint, indirect association with that literary family for which I have unbounded admiration.

The discovery was made when I was passed for review a monogram entitled "The Life and Works of William Carus Wilson, 1791 - 1859," by Jane Ewbank. True, the association of the Rev. William Carus Wilson with the young Charlotte Bronte was a most unfortunate one, for this reverend gentleman was the origin of Mr. Brocklehurst. Principal of that dreadful school in "Jane Eyre." Charlotte Bronte described him In unflattering terms: Mr. Brocklehurst is not a god, nor is he even a great and admired man; he is little liked here; ha never took steps to make himself liked."

The school of Jane Eyre was based on Cowan Bridge School, the Clergy Daughters' School on the turnpike road between Leeds and Kendal, attended by Charlotte and three of her sisters, Maria, Elizabeth, and Emily. Maria died front consumption, and Charlotte attributed this to the conditions at their school.

Later the school was moved from Cowan Bridge to a healthier site, Kirkby Lonsdale. As Casterton School, it still flourishes. Jane Ewbank, a pupil at the school, has written a monograph to mark the centenary of the death of the founder William Carus WIlson.

Roger Fulford has written foreword to the little book, and he says, truly: "We must applaud the courage of anyone attempting to give us a biographical sketch of Mr. Carus Wilson — the 19th Century philanthropist and founder of the Clergy Daughters' School... we can all recognize the poetic justice which enables a pupil at the school to challenge the verdict of the most illustrious of its old girls with this monograph.

" Not everyone may agree with everything which Jane Ewbank has written ... but I feel sure that everyone reading this short biography will share my admiration for the youthful talent so delightfully and conspicuously displayed."

PORTSMOUTH...
  
Where does Portsmouth come into all this?

Mr. Carus Wilson retired to live at Ventnor, and during this time he became well-known in Portsmouth, where he did good work for the soldiers who were, at that time, embarking for India. He provided the first Soldiers' Institute and became known in Portsmouth as "the soldiers' friend." So the man Charlotte Bronte loathed at Cowan Bridge later became well beloved in Portsmouth.

The fashion for debunking the figures of the past seems to have died, and Mrs. Ewbank's book is in the newer tradition of tolerant reassessment. She points out, justly, that, when considering the Rev. Carus Wilson, we must remember that we live in a different age, which upholds other ideas and beliefs. "We must not be tempted to Judge him by modern standards but by those of his day."

It is refreshing to find a young person those days who is able to take such a balanced view; but such a statement also shows that Charlotte Bronte, like many thinkers and writers of genius, was in advance of her time.

The puritans of the world, taken as a whole, have done as much harm as the reprobates. The Rev. Carus Wilson was not only a puritan, but one who was anxious to save the souls of his young charges from hell and damnation. His theology was the basis of his actions. A glance at the prospectus of his school shows the influence of his theological views and puritan outlook. The education offered was liberal, but not the doctrinal teaching. Sinisterly, in modern eyes, reads the pronouncement "No vacations allowed" and the teaching post described as "Scourge Mistress."

MORE AGREEABLE

Yet a more agreeable light falls upon Mr. Carus Wilson when we read of his work in Portsmouth. He wrote a tract with a strangely prophetic title, " Portsmouth in Flames," in which he vigorously attacked the sins of "drunkenness, debauchery and ungodliness" among soldiers.

One of the largest brewers in Portsmouth was "convinced of the sin which the sale of his beer caused and decided to abandon his prosperous business altogether," writes Miss Ewbank. The police reported that there was a "visible decrease in the amount of drunkenness and disorder." Many of us, by no means teetotal fanatics, could wish for a Carus Wilson today.

The great Lord Shaftesbury  praised his work in Portsmouth. Week after week Mr. Wilson came over from Ventnor to Portsmouth to preach to the soldiers despite bad weather and ill-health; he was in continual pain.

In St John's Church, Newport, Isle of Wight, is a fine, white  marble monument, sculptured by R. Westmacott. R.A., erected to the memory of the Rev. Carus Wilson, by "The Non-Commissioned Officers and  Privates of the British Army in token of their love and gratitude."

"THAT GOOD MAN"

But even more striking are the simple words of a native African soldier on his deathbed: "Oh! massa, if God takes me Home, me will see that good man, Massa Carus Wilson..."

Though this reverend gentleman's theology was harsh, and though he employed a bad cook at Charlotte Bronte's old school (the main cause of the trouble there, it seems), and though he employed a "Scourge Mistress," at the end there were those who remembered him with gratitude.

"The Life and Works of Carus Wilson" is published at Kendal by Titus Wilson and Son, Ltd. The price is not given. C.H.G.
