Hampshire Advertiser - Saturday 15 April 1843

NEWPORT, APRIL 15. Convict Dicipline. — In compliance with a return moved for in the House of Commons, for copies of correspondence on the subject of convict discipline, the following letter was laid on the table, addresssed by Sir James Graham to the Committee of Visitors of Parkhurst Prison —

"My Lords and Gentlemen — I am anxious to bring under your notice the copy of a despatch addressed by Lord Stanley to the Lieutenant Governor of Van Diemen's Land, because it contains the announcement of a scheme of convict discipline in the penal colony, which is intimately connected with the future management of the prison placed under your control.

"You will observe, that henceforth the convicts undergoing the sentence of transportation will be divided into three classes :—

"First. The probationary gangs, who will be subject to hard labor without wages, under strict coercion ana every penal privation consistent with health.

"Second. Those to whom probation passes will be granted, which will entitle them to work for hire: under certain restraints gradually diminishing, and for wages progressively increasing in proportion as their character for good conduct is established, and as they recede from crime, and advance in habits of industry and virtue.

"Third. Those who obtain tickets of leave, which, except the restraint of living within the penal colony, the constant survey of the controller of convicts, and the pain of forfeiture in case of misconduct, may be considered equivalent to a pardon, and to the restoration to liberty.

"This is the division with respect to adults.

"It is the intention of the Government to extend this same division to Juvenile convicts, except, that instead of the first class, which in the case of adults is termed the probationary gang, the youths will be sent to Point Puer, where the most rigid discipline, combined with forced labor and instruction, is severely maintained, to an extent which amounts to hardship and to unremitted punishment.

"Every boy who enters Parkhurst is doomed to be transported, and this part of the sentence passed on him is immutable.

"He must bid a long farewell to the hopes of revisiting his native home, of seeing his parents, or of rejoining his companions. These are the hopes and pleasure, which his crimes have forfeited; but he should be made to understand that his future prospects in life entirely depend on his conduct at Parkhurst.

"Within a few days after his first arrival in the prison, when his character has been in some degree ascertained, it will be the duty of the governor to open to him a distinct view of his new position. He should be informed that his transportation to a distant colony is certain: that to prepare him for his great change immediate instruction is provided; that he will have full means of acquiring the saving knowledge of the religious and moral truths which may reclaim him from vice, and lead him to virtue — that he will have an opportunity of learning various handicrafts, which, in the distant country where he is going, will enable him to earn an honest livelihood, and to acquire even independant comfort— but that everything depends on his own conduct and exertions in the prison, where he must remain not less than two years, nor more than three— that at the expiration of that time his doom will be fixed according to his merits— if he has done well, and if on the whole his attainments and conduct are good, he will on landing in Van Diemen's Land, receive a ticket of leave, and virtually be pardoned— if his conduct be different, he will receive, on landing, a probationary pass, which is far short of freedom, and retains the character and many of the pains of punishment— if his conduct be bad, he will be sent to Point Puer, where every hardship and degradation awaits him, and where his sufferings will be severe.

"He should also be informed that if he be intractable or incorrigible he will be instantly dismissed from Parkhurst, and transported to Paint Puer by the first ship which sails. These are the hopes and fears, the rewards and punishments, which should be brought to operate on the youthful mind of the convict from the first hour of his entrance into Parkhurst until the day of his departure.

"I will not dwell on the scheme of instruction or the system of moral and religious training which are now established ln this prison under your care. Experience mar suggest gradual improvements. I do not desire to effect a change, but I am anxious to call to your aid the advantages which this amended scheme of convict discipline in the colony presents, and to place in your hands this powerful instrument by which the timid may be encouraged, and the hardened may be subdued: which will stimulate the indolent to exertion, and which may bring back the outcast to repentance.

"I rely on your discretion ln the application of these additional means, which will make you the masters of the future fate of these unhappy children. They are generally the victims of gross neglect and of ignorance; under your superintendence they will be well instructed and trained to industry and useful knowledge. Let neither caprice, nor prejudice, nor favour interfere with a just estimate of their respective characters; and let the decision on the lot which shall await each convict on his arrival in the penal colony be strictly impartial.

"For this purpose it will be necessary to use caution in receiving reports from those who are placed In authority over them; and prudence will dictate the establishment of checks which may counteract hasty conclusions, and the effect of undue prepositions.

"I will not dilate on these details; the extent of the trust confided to you will inspire care; and I rest satisfied in the conviction that you will exercise this new power with sound judgment and discretion — I have, &c.,  
(Signed) J. R. G. GRAHAM."

JUVENILE OFFENDERS.

The following is a copy of the bill which has been prepared by Lord John Russell and Mr. Fox Mauls, for establishing a prison for young offenders:—

"Whereas it may be of great public advantage that a prison be provided in which young offenders may be detained and corrected, and may receive such instruction and be subject to such discipline as shall appear most conducive to their reformation, and to the repression of crime. And whereas the buildings at Parkhurst, in the Isle of Wight, lately used as a military hospital and as a medical asylum for the children of soldiers, are buildings which may be conveniently used for such a prison; Be it therefore enacted, &c., that it shall be lawful for her Majesty, by warrant under the royal sign manual, to appoint that the said buildings at Parkhurst shall be used as a prison for the confinement of such offenders as are hereinafter specified, as soon as the same can be fitted and completed for that purpose; and the said buildings shall thereupon become a prison for the lawful confinement of such offenders, and be within the provisions of an act passed in the sixth year of the reign of his late Majesty, intituled, 'An Act for effecting greater Uniformity of Practice in the Government of the several Prisons in England and Wales, and for appointing Inspectors of Prisons in Great Britain.'

"And be it enacted, that it shall be lawful for one of her Majesty's principal secretaries of state to appoint for Parkhurst prison a governor, a chaplain, a surgeon, a matron, and such other officers,assistants and servants, as may be necessary for the service and discipline of the prison, and at pleasure to remove all or any of the said governor, chaplain, surgeon, matron, and other officers, assistants and servants, and to appoint others in their room, and to fix the salaries to be paid to each of them.

"And be it enacted, that it shall be lawful for one of her Majesty's principal secretaries of state to direct the removal to Parkhurst prison of any young offender, male or female, as well those under sentence or order of transportation, as those under sentence of imprisonment, who having been examined by an experienced surgeon or apothecary, shall appear to be free from any putrid or infectious distemper, and fit to be removed from the gaol, prison, or place in which such offender shall be confined Provided always, that every offender so removed, who shall be under sentence of transportation, shall, nevertheless, be within the provisions of an act passed in the fifth year of the reign of King George the Fourth, intituled, 'An Act for the Transportation of Offenders from Great Britain,' in case the secretary of state shall direct that he or she shall be afterwards removed from Parkhurst prison, as hereinafter provided.

"And be it enacted, that every offender who shall be so removed to Parkhurst prison shall continue there until he or she shall be transported according to law, or shall become entitled to his or her liberty, or until the secretary of state shall direct the removal of such offender to the gaol, prison or place from which he or she shall have been brought, or in which he or she may be lawfully confined, and the sheriff, gaoler, or other person having the custody of any offender whose removal to Parkhurst prison shall be ordered in manner aforesaid, shall, with all convenient speed after the receipt of any such order, convey, or cause to be conveyed, every such offender to Parkhurst prison, and shall there deliver him or her to the governor of the prison, with a true copy, attested by such sheriff or gaoler, of the caption and order of the court by which such offender was sentenced, containing the sentence of every such offender by virtue whereof he or she shall be in the custody of such sheriff or gaoler, and also a certificate specifying such particulars within the knowledge of the sheriff or gaoler concerning such offender as may be from time to time directed by the secretary of state; and the governor then give a receipt in writing to the sheriff or gaoler for his discharge; and all reasonable expenses which the sheriff or gaoler shall incur in every such removal shall be paid by the county, riding, division city, borough, liberty or place, for which the court in which the offender was convicted shall have been holden.

"And be it enacted, that it shall be lawful for the secretary of state at any time to order any offender to be removed from Parkhurst prison as incorrigible, and in every such case the offender so removed shall be liable to be transported or confined under his or her original sentence or sentences of transportation or imprisonment to the full extent of the term or terms specified in such sentence or sentences, and shall be subject to all the consequences of such sentence or sentences, in the same manner as if no order for sending him or her to Parkhurst prison had been made.

"And be it enacted, that after the delivery of any such offender as aforesaid into the custody to which he or she shall be so ordered as aforesaid, such governor or other person having the custody of offenders under his direction shall, during the term for which such offender shall remain in his custody, have the same powers over such offender as are incident to the office of a sheriff or gaoler; and in case of any abuse of such custody, or other misbehaviour or negligence in the discharge of his office, shall be liable to the same punishment as a gaoler is now liable to by law.

"And be it enacted, that the secretary of state shall be empowered from time to time to make rules for the government and regulation of Parkhurst prison and for the discipline of the offenders imprisoned therein, and to subscribe a certificate that they are fit to be enforced, and all such rules shall be laid before parliament within six weeks after such rules shall be certified, or if parliament be not then sitting, within six weeks after the next meeting of parliament.

"And be it enacted, that it shall be lawful for the secretary of state from time to time to specify, by such regulations as aforesaid, such offences which, if committed in Parkhurst prison by male convicts, shall appear to him deserving of corporal punishment; and if any male offender in Parkhurst prison shall commit any offence whereby he shall, under any regulation then in force, become liable to corporal punishment, the governor of the said prison shall have power to inflict such punishment.

"And be it enacted, that if any offender who shall be ordered to be confined in Parkhurst prison shall, at any time during the term of such confinement, break prison, or escape from the place of his or her confinement, or in his or her conveyance to such place of confinement, or from any lands belonging to the prison, or from the person or persons having the lawful custody of such offender, he or she so breaking prison or escaping shall be punished, if under sentence of imprisonment, by an addition, not exceeding two years, to the term for which he or she, at the time of his or her breach of prison or escape, was subject to be confined; and, if under sentence of transportation, in such manner as persons under sentence of transportation, escaping from or breaking out of any other prison or place of confinement, are liable to be punished; and if an offender so punished by such addition to the term of confinement shall afterwards be convicted of a second escape or breach of prison, he or she shall be adjudged guilty of felony; and if any offender, who shall be ordered to be confined in the said prison, shall, at any time during the term of such confinement, attempt to break prison, or escape from the place of his or her confinement, or shall forcibly break out of his or her cell, or shall make any breach therein with intent to escape, he or she so offending, being convicted thereof, shall be punished by imprisonment for a term not exceeding twelve calendar months, in addition to the punishment to which he or she at the time of committing any such offence was subject.

"And be it enacted, that every person who shall rescue any offender who shall be ordered to be confined within Parkhurst prison, either during the time of his or her conveyance to the said prison, or whilst such offender shall be in the custody of the person or persons under whose care and charge he or she shall be so confined, and also every person who shall aid in any such rescue, shall be guilty of felony; and every person having the custody of any such offender, or employed by the person having such custody, as a keeper, under-keeper, turnkey, assistant or guard, who shall knowingly allow such offender to escape, and also every person who shall, by supplying arms, tools, or instruments of disguise, or otherwise in any manner aid any such offender in any escape, or in any attempt to make an escape, though no escape he actually made, or who shall attempt to rescue any such offender, or aid in any such attempt, though no rescue be actually made, shall be guilty of felony; and every person having such custody, or being so employed by the person having such custody as aforesaid, who shall carelessly allow any such offender to escape shall be guilty of a misdemeanor, and, being lawfully convicted of the same, shall be liable to fine or imprisonment, or to both, at the discretion of the court.

"And be it enacted, that any offender who shall escape, break prison, or be rescued in manner aforesaid, shall be tried before the justices of oyer and terminer or gaol delivery, either for the county where he or she shall be apprehended and re-taken, or for the county in which the said offence shall have been committed; and in case of any prosecution for any such escape, attempt to escape, breach of prison or rescue, either against the offender escaping, or attempting to escape, of breaking prison, or being rescued, or against any other person or persons concerned therein, or aiding the same, a copy properly attested of the order of commitment to Parkhurst prison shall, after proof made that the person then in question before the court is the same who was delivered with such order, be sufficient evidence to the court and jury that the person then in question was so ordered to such confinement.

"And be it enacted, that the provisions of all acts of parliament for rendering justices of peace more safe in the execution of their office shall extend to the governor of Parkhurst prison acting in the execution of this act.

"And be it enacted,that all actions, suits and prosecutions to be commenced against any person or persons for anything done in pursuance of this act, shall be laid and tried in the county or place where the fact was committed, and shall be commenced within six months after the fact committed, and not otherwise or afterwards.

"And be it enacted, that a report upon the state of Parkhurst prison, and of the persons confined therein, and also an account of the expenses of carrying this act into execution, shall be annually laid before parliament by the secretary of state.

"And be it enacted, that this act may be amended or repealed by any act to be passed in this present session of parliament."

HELPS FOR THE SAVING OF YOUNG OUTCASTS

[from the SPECTATOR.]

It is a circumstance which serves to relieve political contest of much of its bitterness, that there are grounds, of the profoundest interest, upon which those who are most opposed in the passing questions of the day can meet a nobler struggle for the general good. Of this kind is a subject which has begun to press upon the attention of the public, both from its urgency and from its appealing directly to the common feelings of humanity. The exertions of a few benevolent men have lately thrown the light of inquiry more forcibly on the existing system of treating juvenile delinquents; and by the help of Parliamentary and Government investigations, the public have been made aware of the monstrous fact, that a large portion of the criminals who crowd the gaols of the country are made so, either by the total neglect of their infant years, or by the very measures which have for their professed object the reformation of the criminal. Laws have been devised, by which parents and relatives are made answerable for the bodily sustenance of the helpless; but there is no provision for securing to the little wanderer in this world of temptation and error, natural or factitious, even a fraction of the means by which he may learn to guide himself; and, by a refinement in absurdity, those laws which omit all provision for securing the helpless against ignorance, do not permit even inevitable ignorance to be pleaded in excuse for error. It required some such sweeping folly to begin with, in order to make way for the common practice, which babes are solemnly arraigned as criminals, and naughty little children, who "know no better," handed over to the gaoler instead of the schoolmaster. No one who has witnessed the wholesale manufacture of thieves and ruffians in our large towns, can be blind to the truly criminal stupidity of existing laws respecting juvenile delinquents. The raw material for our criminal population exists abundantly, in the shape of children whose parents are occupied in ceaseless toil— dead to their children in habitual drunkenness or habitual imprisonment—or so lost to nature as to drive their children from them. Such are the little wretches whom the old iron dealers of Lancashire seduce with cakes and tartlets to steal bits of iron work from factory yards; who are sent to continue their education in the gaol, and so, under the tuition of the ablest professors of crime, to graduate in the beer shop.—Such are ————— but we need not pursue the specification of varieties.

Among those whose station and benevolent disposition make a most useful labourer in the good work of remedying this melancholy state of things, we find an old opponent of ours, Mr. Sergeant Adams. As a Judge of the Metropolitan County, he must have had the best opportunity of combining large experience with impartial observation; and his statements, therefore, bear the stamp of authority. In a recent letter to Mr. Hawes, quoted in the *Times* yesterday, Mr. Adams says—

"In the great majority of cases of juvenile offenders of thirteen years of age and under it, it is unjust to consider them criminals in the ordinary sense of the term,—that is to say, as offenders of sufficient age themselves to comprehend the social duties of civilized life, or offenders who, having been instructed in those duties, have violated them. Many of these unhappy children are wandering and houseless orphans, without a friend to succour them, and committing petty thefts as a means of subsistence; others are hired by practised ruffians to rob and plunder, and initiated by them in every species of low and demoralizing debauchery. Many are children of poor but respectable parents, seduced by boys of riper years to commit little pilferings, for which they find a ready market; whilst some contribute to the support of their profligate parents by the fruits of their dishonest industry.

"It is not that these boys are naturally more vicious and depraved than the children of honest parents, but that their evil propensities have been encouraged, and their virtuous ones benumbed. How can a child of tender years, who has received no instruction, religious or moral, or who has been sent out by his parents to beg or steal—caressed when successful, and punished when unlucky—form any just notion his duties either to God to society? And if two or three months' discipline of the tread-wheel, oakum-room, or solitary cell, (repeated at intervals, as the case may require,) could impart them to him, what means has he, when he quits his prison, of putting his newly acquired principles into action? There is far greater hope, under a kind and judicious system of the reformation of these unfortunate and neglected beings, than of the children of honest and reputable parents who appear at the bar of justice, for such children have had the means of knowledge and neglected it.

"Let assume that Magistrates had the power on the first detection of offenders of tender years, to separate them from their parents; to place them for such terms as may be needful *in some well-disciplined reformatory school, where they may be trained to industrious habits, not by prison but school discipline ;* and then to send them to some healthy colony, (thus making expatriation the penalty of the parents' sins, and the price of their own moral redemption,) there, under proper superintendence, and removed from their old temptations, to serve out their youthful years as apprentices to well-conducted masters. Who will say that under such a system the majority of such offenders might not be reclaimed and become useful members of society? who will dare to say that the experiment is not worth the trial ?

"A plan of this nature might, a short time ago, have been deemed visionary; but the cause of humanity has made great process during the last two years.

"In the statute for establishing a juvenile prison at Parkhurst, (the most humane act of the session of 1835,) is contained a cause authorizing her Majesty to grant pardons to juvenile offenders, upon condition that they will place themselves under the care of some charitable institution willing to receive them, and giving Magistrates the same jurisdiction over such children as they possess over apprentices.

"Up to the month of July 1838, the age of seven was the age of legal and moral responsibility; and no distinction was known in the law between that age and the age of the ripest judgment. By the above mentioned clause in the Parkhurst Prison Act, a new and glorious principal is recognized. Children may now be treated as children, although they may have incurred the penalty of the law. Education is to supercede incarceration; and the funds of private charity, and the benevolent exertions of the virtuous and humane, may be legally called in in aid of public justice for the reformation of the young offender. This is a principle in which the Christian philanthropist may unhesitatingly rejoice; may its practical fruits be worthy of its promise!

"In furtherance of these views, but limiting their application for the present to the Metropolitan district, so that if in practice they prove to be unsound there may be less difficulty in retracing our steps, I would (so far as regards children under thirteen years) take from Magistrates their present power of summary jurisdiction, and substitute very extensive powers of a different nature; for I have no fear of summary power when it is to be exercised in moral improvement and not in bodily incarceration.

"When a child is charged with such offences as would bring him within the present schemes of summary jurisdiction, or send him for trial at the Sessions, I would empower the justice before whom he is brought, to dismiss the charge altogether; or direct him to be whipped and locked up upon bread and water for some short period; or send him under an order to the parish or union workhouse, or under their warrant, at the expence of their parents, if they are of sufficient substance, or the expence of the Government, County, Parish, Union, as the case may require, (the Justice having the power to make the order accordingly\*) to some institution for the reformation of young offenders; there to remain and abide by its rules, of which ultimate apprenticeship in some healthy colony should, for reasons already given, generally if not invariably, form one. In case of breach of the rules, the Magistrates to be authorized to commit under the authority given by statute 2d Victoria I.; and if a child who has been so dealt should commit a subsequent felony, the committal to the Sessions to be compulsory, and the punishment transportation. These powers not be understood as superseding the power of committal for trial, which would still be necessary in all aggravated cases, or when the hand of mercy had been held out in vain.

"An opinion, I know, prevails amongst the Prison Inspectors, that children who have been brought before a criminal tribunal and convicted, although summarily, of any offence against the law, should from that time cease to be objects of individual benevolence, and become children of the State, and placed wholly under the control of Government. Of the soundness of this opinion, when the age of childhood is passed, and a conviction has taken place before a regularly constituted tribunal, there can be no doubt: but it does not seem applicable to the cases now under consideration. The infusion of new members gives a constant freshness to the exertioos of charitable institutions, which cannot be attained under the necessary formalities of Government offices; and private charities must always enjoy more of the parental character than boards. The Cape of Good Hope and South Australia present unlimited fields for the exercise of these benevolent views; and new societies will be formed, or, amongst the numerous charitable institutions now in existence, a sufficient number will adapt themselves to the plan to remove all doubt as to its practibility. Nor, because the public purse will be in part employed, let a niggardly economy be inlisted against us. It will cost the state less to reform a child in his youth, and make him a valuable subject in a free colony, than to pay for his repeated trials and support him in his various imprisonments through life as a convicted felon."

The children thus reclaimed from a life of misery and crime might supply a useful class of servants for the Colonies, with great advantage to themselves. But probably it would be advisable not make expatriation an invariable consequence, as it is not indeed a necessary adjunct of the reformatory process. The inmates of the juvenile penitentiary at Auburn, in the United States, are eagerly sought for as servants, in the immediate neighbourhood of the place; so little does the discredit of infant error attach to the well-trained youth who leaves what is known to an admirable school. In fact, to give the reclaimed delinquent the most satisfactory of characters, it is only necessary that the system of reformation to which he has been subjected should be known to be thoroughly efficacious. But without doubt, youths whose earlier ties had been broken would frequently be willing emigrants; and would clearly be of use if the Colonies competed with the Mother-country in offering a home to those who have been rescued from destruction.

\* It is not intended in this letter to into the details of the plan; but if the principle be recognized, they may be easily arranged.

MIDDLESEX SESSIONS Nor. 19. In the case of a boy named Michael Quigley, 10 years of age, who is tried and convicted of running away with a mask, value 4d., on Guy Fawkes day, which, in a childish freak, he put upon his own face, from which it was taken by the prosecutor's daughter.

The learned Judge said that he did hope the public indignation would rise against the old mode of criminal punishment in cases like that in which this child was implicated. The Children's Friend Society had been broken up by the *Times*, which then exercised a powerful but unjust influence to the detriment of that benevolent society. The Secretary of State, in a communication which he had recently received, respecting Parkhurst Prison, had, from motives of state policy, he supposed, found that institution not applicable to boys committing offences of a lighter description. There was now nothing to be done but to brand children guilty of such thoughtless acts, as was the case in the present instance, as felons for life. As far as his feeling were concerned he would say to the jury acquit the prisoner, but such a course would not be consistent with his duty as the law now stood. The Court adjourned at six o'clock.

MEETING OF MIDDLESEX MAGISTRATES. A meeting of justices of the county of Middlesex took place on Thursday at Hicks's Hall, Clerkenwell-green, for the transaction of the ordinary business. Mi. Pownall in the chair, • The number of prisoners in the House of Correction was 909, of whom 605 were males, 286 females, and 18 children. The Assistant Judge laid before the Court a correspondence between himself and 'Secretary Sir James Graham, relating to recommendations to Parkhurst Prison. In reference to this subject, and to the existing criminal jurisprudence as respects juvenile felons generally, an interesting discussion took place. The matter was introduced by Mr. Talk, who intimated that he had had an urgent remonstrance addressed to him in his magisterial capacity by a lady relative to the comparative insufficiency of the means at her disposal to effect the good she wished to accomplish. They were all, no doubt, aware of the active benevolence of Miss Neave, who had devoted her private fortune to the establishment of a house of reformation for the reception of discharged juvenile criminals, to reclaim them from vice, and by a kindly mental and moral discipline to restore them to society if possible better for the punishment they had suffered. He (Mr. Talk) felt that what she had been endeavouring to do should have been done before, as not correction merely, but the reformation of the offender, should be the end of justice. He had been urged to appeal to the Court; but it could do nothing. All that they do was to press the matter upon the consideration of government. Mr. Serjeant Adams said that no one could feel more than himself the importance of this subject, as it was now evident from the correspondence which hail taken place between himself and the Home Office, and which was before them, that Parkhurst Prison was now closed to almost every case from that court. He had received distinct directions, that unless juvenile offenders of an age and stature specified had committed an offence for which transportation was the proper punishment, they were not to be sent to the Isle of Wight. The consequence was, that not one case in five hundred of the common larcenies tried in that court could now be sent there. The Children's Friend Society was at an end, and there was nothing substituted in its place. The extent of the evil would be apparent when he stated, that about one-third of the prisoners committed for larcenies by that court were children (hear). There was no question but that something should be done. The difficulty was to agree upon the way of doing it; whether convicted and friendless children from the age of 7 to 14 should be, on their discharge, received in an institution founded by a public grant or private subscription! He should be again most willing to lend a helping hand in any way that might be deemed most expedient for the benefit of these poor children (hear, hear). Mr. Laurie said, that in France, Holland, and generally on the Continent, establishments were provided expressly for that destitute class of juvenile offenders to which their attention had been drawn. The importance of the matter would be apparent when he stated that out of 26,000 criminal committals in England and Wales last year nearly one-half, or 40 per cent., of the whole were between the ages of 15 and 25; and if they took in the ages under 15, it would amount to 75 per cent. (hear, hear). On a comparison of the two • last five years the increase was very considerable. Something must be done. Crime was increasing, and it evidently, as the returns showed, not from want of education. As the destitution of this class of society was a public evil, it should be remedied by a national establishment supported hy the national funds. A very full bench of justices * concurred generally . in the importance of subject, but no active measures were adopted,

MIDDLESEX SESSIONS, Jan. 6. The Parkhurst Prison.—/Viotnar Miller, aged 8 years, tad Henry Hawley, aged 15, were convicted, upon the clearest testimony, of having stolen wooden till containing 11.11 s 6d, and two canvass bags, the property of Andrew Glass. The Learned Judge said that these boys were, in his opinion, just the fitting subjects for the Parkhurst Prison; but he did not well see how they could be so consistently with the present regulations, for one was too young, and the offence of neither, of itself, appeared to warrant the sentence of transportation. lie found, upon inquiry, that the little boy Miller had been previously twice convicted of felony, once at that court, in the month of August last, and once at the Central Criminal Court, upon the 24th of November last, when he had received sentence of 10 days' imprisonment. The other boy, too, had, during the last year, been previously convicted in that court, and also been summarily convicted. Further inquiry into the condition of the boys had been made, he found, since their commitment; and it appeared that, notwithstanding two letters had been sent to their parents, they had not come forward or taken the slightest notice of the children. This was precisely the case where he thought Parkhurst would have proved of benefit. The prisoners were children neglected l>y their parents, and clearly were steeped in crime. Now, had they been sent to Parkhurst, they would in all human probability have been reclaimed; they would have received proper education, and would have been taught trade, so that they would have been in a position to earn their future livelihood and become respectable members of society. But he would, notwithstanding the age of the prisoners this case, sentence them to transportation for seven years, and the Government must exercise their own discretion to sending the boys to Parkhurst or not. What could that Court do in such a case? was perfectly manifest that some provision ought, and indeed must be made for these juvenile offenders, unless it was intended that the metropolis was to overrun with crime. He had understood that the Parkhurst prison was established for that purpose; but by the present regulations no prisoners would admitted there who would not be sentenced to transportation if Parkhurst did not exist. Parkhurst, therefore, so far as the metropolitan district was concerned, was dead letter. Since his appointment to the office which he had the honour occupy in that court had tried upwards of 278 boys, ranging from the age of 8 to 14, and yet it was lamentable to say, that for not one of those poor creatures was there any legislative provision. The Court, matters stood, had but one course left for it to take, and that was to sentence those boys to transportation for seven years. He, however, hoped that the time would arrive when the legislature would adopt some effective provisions for checking juvenile crime, and pointing out punishments fitting for the ages and circumstances of children, the greater part of whom were without friends or home. The sentence of the Court was,that the prisoners should each transported for seven years.

PARKHURST PRISON.

The following is copy of a letter which has been recently received by the Court of Quarter Sessions for the county of Middlesex, relative to the sending of prisoners to Parkhurst Prison :—

"Whitehall, Nov. 14, 1845.

"Sir,—I am directed by Secretary Sir James Graham to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 27th of August last, in which, after adverting to Sir James Graham's opinion, in his letter of the 16th of that month, 'that it is inexpedient to pass sentence of transportation on children for offences not of an aggravated character merely for the purpose of obtaining their admission to Parkhurst Prison,' you observe that the Court of Quarter Sessions over which you preside will be placed in some difficulty, unless it obtains clear understanding of the nature of the cases which are considered proper for admission to that prison; and you further observe, that, if the fitness of the prisoner is to be judged by the character of the offence of which he is convicted, the prison will become a dead letter, so far as the county Middlesex is concerned.

"Sir James Graham directs me to inform you in the first place, that it is no part of the design of the establishment Parkhurst, to relieve counties from the charge and the maintenance of juvenile offenders, and I he cannot, therefore, take notice of that consideration. 

"I am also to inform you Sir James Graham is of opinion that prisoners who have been guilty of offences, not of a serious description, for which they would be more properly punished by imprisonment, and not by transportation, are not fit subjects for admission into Parkhurst Prison. All prisoners admitted there are to be finally sent abroad, and before they are sent are to be subjected to a long and very strict discipline; this is the rule that has been uniformly acted upon by Sir James Graham; and it appears to him to be manifestly unjust that offenders should be so punished in cases where, if no such establishment as that at Parkhurst had existed, they would have received no higher punishment than imprisonment in this country.

"Some limitation and selection have been found by experience to be necessary with regard to the age and size of prisoners, as all prisoners admitted into Parkhurst are ultimately destined to work in the colonies. The fittest age for admission is considered to be about fourteen, and the size or stature should be proportionate.

"Sir James Graham requests that this information may be communicated to the magistrates of the county, and that in making recommendations for admission of prisoners into Parkhurst prison, the principles above mentioned should for the future be observed.—I am, &c, (Signed) S. M. PHILLIPS. Mr. Sergeant Adams, &c."

MIDDLESEX SESSIONS. -TUESDAY. The quarter sessions for this county commenced to-day at Hicks's-hall, Clerkenweil. There was the usual attendance of magistrates.

THE PARKHURST PRISON.-Thomas Miller, aged 8 years, and Henry Rawley, aged 15, were convicted, upon the clearest testimony, of having stolen a wooden till, containing 1l. 11s. 6d., and two canvas bags, the property of Andrew Glass.—The learned judge said, that these boys were, in his opinion, just the fitting subjects for the Parkhurst Prison; but he did not well see how they could be so consistently with the present regulations, for one was too young, and the offence of neither, of itself, appeared to warrant the sentence of transportation. He found, upon inquiry, that the little boy Miller had been previously twice convicted of felony, once at that court, in the month of August last, and once at the Central Criminal Court, upon the 24th of November last, when he had received sentence of 10 days' imprisonment. The other boy, too, had, during the last year, been previously convicted in that court, and also been summarily convicted. Further inquiry into the condition of the boys had been made, he found, since their commitment; and it appeared that, notwithstanding two letters had been sent to their parents, they had not come forward or taken the slightest notice of the children. This was precisely the case where he thought Parkhurst would have proved of benefit. The prisoners were children neglected by their patents, and clearly were steeped in crime. Now, had they been sent to Parkhurst, they would in all human probability have been reclaimed; they would have received a proper education, and would have been taught a trade, so that they would have been in a position to earn their future livelihood and become respectable members of society. But he would, notwithstanding the age of the prisoners in this case, sentence them to transportation for seven years, and the Government must exercise their own discretion as to sending the boys to Parkhurst or not. What could that court do with such a case! It was perfectly manifest that some provision ought, and indeed must be made for these juvenile offenders, unless it was intended that the metropolis was to be over-run with crime. He had understood that the Parkhurst Prison was established for that purpose; but by the present regulations, no prisoners would be admitted there who would not be sentenced to transportation if Parkhurst did not exist. Parkhurst, therefore, so far as the metropolitan district was concerned, was a dead letter. Since his appointment to the office which he had the honour to occupy in that court, he had tried upwards of 270 boys, ranging from the age of eight to fourteen, and yet it was lamentable to say, that for not one of those poor creatures was there any legislative provision. The court, as matters stood, had but one course left for it to take, and that was to sentence these boys to transportation for seven years. He, however, hoped that the time would arrive when the legislature would adopt some effective provisions for checking juvenile crime, and ' jinting out punishments fitting for the ages and circumstances of children, the greater part of whom were without friends or home. The sentence of the court was, that the prisoners should each be transported for seven years.

PARKHURST PRISON. Mr. EDITOR,—About twelve months since a correspondence took place between the Assistant Judge of the Middlesex Sessions and the then Secretary of State, Sir James Graham, relative to the description of juvenile offenders that ought to be admitted to the above prison, which your readers will no doubt recollect was built expressly for the reception and reformation of juvenile offenders; and that, to qualify them for admission, it was necessary that they should have been convicted of some offence, the penalty for which amounted to transportation. In the course of that correspondence, the Secretary of State expressed an opinion, "that it was inexpedient to pass sentence of transportation on children for offences not of an aggravated character, merely for the purpose of their obtaining admission into Parkhurst Prison." In reply to which, the Learned Judge, among other things, said, that the young thieves of the Metropolis lived by the commission of small thefts, and, if the fitness of a prisoner for Parkhurst were to be judged of by the offence of which he had been convicted, the Act under which the prison was established would become a dead letter as far as the county of Middlesex was concerned; and in another letter he states, "We (the Magistrates) had supposed it was intended as an experimental prison, to try the effect of active employment and moral and religious discipline, steadily pursued for a considerable period, upon the habits and conduct of such juvenile offenders as had fallen, as it were, in childhood into vicious courses, and whose evil habits were the result of ignorance and bad example, and not a receptacle tor those children who may have committed a single offence, but whose character and habits would bear the test of previous inqoiry." To this Sir James Graham replied, "that prisoners convicted of offences not punishable with transportation, were not fit subjects for admission into Parkhurst prison; adding that all prisoners admitted there are to be finally sent abroad, and before they are sent, to be subjected to long and very strict discipline. The result of the above correspondence was that no more prisoners were recommended (after conviction, at the Middlesex sessions), for admission to Parkhurst prison, and the Learned Judge has every Session made some allusion to the circumstance. This has led the public to inquire as to the manner in which the Parkhurst prison has hitherto been conducted, and on this matter I will now endeavour to enlighten them, by giving some extracts from the Government report as to the state of that prison, which has been printed and circulated within the last week. From that document it appears that—" As usual, in nearly all our Government establishments the officers' salaries absorb more than one third of the entire expences of the establishment From the . published statement of expenditure on account of the prison during the year 1845, it appears that the total expense was £18,067 8., out of which sum no less than £4,723 41. 3d., was paid as salaries to the various officers, being upwards of £6OO more than the total cost of diet for all the prisoners within that period, which only amounted to £4,184 9v. 4d. During that year, the total number of prisoners was 622; the cost of each individual for the year, was 2s. Id., of which sum, £6 14s. fid. was expended on diet, and £1 10s. on clothing. So, that the expense for the food and clothing of each prisoner is only two-fifths of the whole, the remaining three-fifths being for salaries to officers and other expenses; in fact, the salaries to officers is more than dine-fourths of the cost of diet and clothing of each prisoner. It appears that the total value of the prisoner's labour, for the year, was £2,046 55. 2d., but little more than £3 a head, a very small sum for a boy to earn in a year, and not more than one-sixth of the expense of keeping him in prison, proof that the labour in which he has been employed had not been turned to a very profitable account. So much for the Report of the Governor. The Report of the Chaplain furnishes some curious particulars. It completely exposes the inutility of the system of education pursued at our different National Schools, where boys are taught to repeat the Catechism by rote, so many parrots, and with no greater knowledge of the meaning of the words they utter. By way of illustrating the condition in the above respect, of 163 of the prisoners, at the period of their admission, the following curious statistics are given: REPETITION OF THE CATECHISM. Complete l4 Some part A small portion Cannot repeat the Lord's Prayer 3 So that there were only three boys out of 153 who could not repeat the Lord's Prayer, and the others could all of them repeat the whole or a portion of the Catechism, which must be of coup* a source of very considerable gratification to the sanctified filequanta:sof ?? Exeter Hall Meetings; but what will even these persons say to a table relative to these same 163 boys which follows almost immediately afterwards, and from which it appears that only seven of them have a considerable knowledge of the meaning of words? Twenty-six are stated to have some such knowledge, 63 very little, and 67 seemly any or none. So much for the utility of the system of teaching boys to repeat catechisms by rote. Their ignorance of every thing that is calculated to benefit them is shown by another table which states that six of them were found to possess some degree of general information, 28 a very little, and 119 scarcely any or none. Yet how commonly is a knowledge of the Lord's prayer considered sufficient to allow of the administering of oaths in courts of justice to young boys and girls, when called upon to give evidence. Not a single question is put to them as to whether they have been made to understand that which they have been taught to repeat. It further appears that out of the above number, there were only 7 who could read well, 66 tolerably, 96 imperfectly, 37 scarcely at all, and 18 could not read at all. In the knowledge of writing they were still more deficient, only 1 being able to write well, 35 tolerably, 38 imperfectly, 52 smuy at all, and 27 not at aIL Such was the state of gross ignos of 150 boys, allot whom, however, could repeat the whore or lions of the cathechism, and such is the result of a system which the parsons describe as the best calculated to promote their wolfram both here and hereafter. Yet, with two exceptions only, the whole of the above 153 had attended the national schools, and more than half of them for upwards of three years. According to the chaplain's own report, very little improvement has taken place in the education of the prisoners during the year 1846—for of 60 of thew, who had been under his especial care during that period, the number who could read well was in that nine only increased by three—who could read imperfectly by 15—and scarcely at all by 12—and as regards the catechism, scriptural knowledge, &c., these is but 1 whose knowledge is considerable, and of the remainder, after 12 months instruction, 30 knew something and the remaining 17 very little. The Report and Appendix, &c. of the Chaplain consists of a variety of statistics duly set forth in different columns; but the result shows that the prisoners have benefited very little by his instructions—and yet this prison was established, and is now kept up at an enormous expense, expressly for the instruction and formation of juvenile offenders. The most amusing of the above reports (if there can be any amusement in reference to a matter of such serious importance) is that of the surgeon, who evidently considers the prisoners confided to his care, as regards their general health, &c., as so many pigs that are to be ultimately to that market for human flesh, Van Diemen's Land—and he is therefore very anxious to show how much they have improved in condition while under his care, and he publishes a variety of tabular statements proving the loss and gain in weight of each prisoner. Thus he says, of fifty five who have been at Parkhurst seventeen months, there a mean gain for each boy of 10-131b5., and a loss of 2 831b5., and that in the earlier periods of imprisonment there is a loss in weights, averaging 0-64Ibs. per month, experienced by about half of the prisoners so confined. This lost, however, (he says) is perfectly compatible with health, and no doubt due to the effects of discipline, regular exercise and labour. If it were due to any depressing influence, it ought to be mote marked, as the period of imprisonment became prolonged; and he adds, with reference to the probationary ward, that the effect of the diet on the prisoners under the discipline of the separate system was equally satisfactory. The period of observation had been four months, and the weighing of 100 prisoners showed the following results at the end of the first and fourth mouth of confinement. At the end of the first month, 69 per cent. had gained, 29 had lost, and 12 retained their original weight. In reference to the prisoners in what is termed the penal class, amounting to 27, he states that 24 have been discharged, and but three remained at the close of the year. The period during which the discipline was enforced varied from 13 days to five months. In no case was it found necessary to remove a prisoner on account of the injurious effects of that discipline, and no prisoner had been placed on extra diet; and he adds, a proof of the scrupulous exactness with which the we,ght of each prisoner was ascertained- Iu the weekly published accounts of the price of the animals sold in Smithfield-market, they are stated to have fetched so much per stone, sink the offal. The human creatures who are fattened previous to transportation to Van Diemen's Land, are weighed with equal care, their weight is duly ascertained "fink the clothes," for the surgeon states, "to prevent error in the above cases, each prisoner was weighed in a state of nudity, and halfan-hour before taking his dinner at the beginning and end of each experiment, and adds this very important comment"It will be seen that all the sixteen prisoners have gained in weight, and in the majority of them this increase in weight ie accompanied with a marked change in appearance—they become pallid sad bloated—but he says farther, they rapidly lose in weight again on being subjected to their former discipline-- exercise and labour— and retain their ruddy complexion. I think after reading the above details, extracted from official documents, the public agree with me that the sooner the Parkhurst prison is a altogether abolished the better, and that if boys admitted there are ultimately to be transported—there is no occasion to pay enormous salaries to parsons who do not offer them any useful instruction, and suer scone who merely take care that they are of a proper weight before they are sent, perhaps, land.

CRIMINAL LAW, In answer to a question, EARL Grey said that a bill would be shortly brought into Parliament, by which the punishment of transportation would be so limited as to be almost abolished. Some changes would still be made to place the pupils at Parkhurst prison under a control Similar to that at Mettray, so far as placing it in the power of Government to recommit them to prison in the event of their conducting themselves badly. It was also intended to establish a penal school in Londen, and to adopt other measures, which he trusted would be attended with beneficial effects. Friday, February 19.

MIDDLESEX SESSIONS, Feb. 23.— The February adjourned session for the county commenced this morning, at the Court House, Clerkenwell-green, before the Assistant Judge and a bench of magistrates. The learned Assistant Judge, in charging the grand jury, said, in allusion to the means resorted to for the reformation of juvenile offenders, that he had visited Parkhurst prison since the last sessions, and there he found the system quite unsuited to the end, in his opinion. The discipline did not treat children as children, and adopt the system of rewards to childish capacities. At Parkhurst there was plenty of work and plenty of books, but no play, and the old adage was but too true, that "All work and no play makes Jack a bad boy." It was not enough to tell these poor children they would by good behaviour in prison probably become respectable men in their old age; they should, as the reward of good conduct, enjoy some privileges which they could understand as children, and even a game of cricket might not be too great a luxury for stimulating them. At present a child of 10 years' old, for stealing a penny•worth, must be sent to the same prison, and subject to the same discipline, as the hardened felon of 40 or 50. But perhaps the greatest evil of the existing system was throwing the responsibility of supporting those children upon the state. When the child was convicted the father was released from all expense on his account; but, in his (the assistant judge's) opinion, the child's parish should be responsible for his support, while the parochial authorities should have the same power to compel the parent to pay back the amount thus expended as they had to make him pay for the support of his family under the ordinary cases of desertion or otherwise.

NEWPORT, SATURDAY, June 3. Parkhurst Prison.—

During the discussion in the Commons, on Friday, respecting the Miscellaneous Estimates, Mr. Hume inquired how the persons liberated from Parkhurst Prison were disposed of. In answer to which question, Mr. V. Smith said that many of those convicts had been sent to Australia, and that the colonists would willingly take many more of them;— no young men ever went out in such excellent condition as these convicts did. Sir J. Graham said he had not had an opportunity, during the last year or two, of inspecting Parkhurst, nor did be know the arrangements made by his successors as to the destination of the boys confined in the prison. When he had the honour to succeed the government of the noble lord (Lord J. Russell) at the Home-office, the Institution was at that time new to him; but he was bound to say that amid all the services of the noble lord to the public, there was not any more meritorious or useful than those which distinguished the noble lord's exertions at Parkhurst. An experience of five years at the Home-office had led him to form a strong opinion that the Institution was most beneficial in its operation.

PARKHURST PRISON ACT.

A youth, named Thomas Rush, 15 years of age, was convicted of stealing twenty-three yards of printed cotton, value Bs., the property Samuel Meyers.

After the conviction, the superintendent of the Mile-end Ragged School came forward to give the prisoner a character. He had been a scholar in this school, and had been entrusted with money, and he (witness) was instructed by the managing committee of the school to state that if the prisoner was discharged they would undertake to provide for him until he was placed in some refuge, or until some more permanent provision was made for him.

The Assistant Judge said the present case offered a very good opportunity for him to give the committee of this and other Ragged Schools a piece of information, which would be important to them in pursuing their praiseworthy endeavours to ameliorate the condition of such wretched creatures as the prisoner at the bar. In the Parkhurst Prison Act there was clause under which her Majesty had the power, by the recommendation her ministers, of granting a pardon to any juvenile delinquent, on condition that some society or institution for the reformation of that class of offenders undertake to take them under their protection, or to make suitable provision for them. The terms of that pardon gave such society the same power over them as a master had over an apprentice; and in case they did not fully conform to the rules and regulations of the society, the pardon was rendered a nullity, and the original sentence hung over them the same as if they had never been pardoned. The clause he referred to whilst it was in operation was productive of the most beneficial results; but the prison inspectors were of opinion that such children as those ought to be considered children of the State rather than objects of private benevolence; and under their advice the government of the day ceased to recommend such offenders for pardon, and consequently the clause was rendered inoperative. He, however, thought that if the Ragged School Committees, and other societies that would exercise their benevolence in the manner pointed out by the Act, were to represent the matter to the Home-office, that Sir G. Grey (who was most anxious to improve the condition of our prisoners) would at once be convinced that the restitution of the provisions of this clause would be attended with beneficial results, and with such practical good that would cause it again to be put into active operation. He mentioned these facts order that it might be made public, end trusted that the superintendent would convey them to the committee, who might not be aware of the existence of such a clause.

The superintendent said that would certainly acquaint the committee with his lordship''s suggestion.

The Assistant Judge wished them success in their good work, and trusted that the government would accede to their request if they applied for the restitution of the clause. The prisoner was sentenced to ten day's solitary confinement.

MIDDLESEX SESSIONS.

(Before Mr. Sergeant Adams and a Bench of Magistrates.)

The May General Quarter Session of the peace for the county of Middlesex commenced yesterday morning at the Sessions House, Clerkenwell. There were eighty-three prisoners for trial, of whom seventy-seven were charged with felony.

The learned Judge, in charging the grand jury, said that on the present occasion there was a slight increase in the number of prisoners committed for trial, and he was glad to say that the dawn of a better system for the treatment of juvenile criminals was approaching. He had great pleasure in informing them that there were now in operation some experiments, which he had no doubt would be very successful, and the success of which, he hoped, would lead to the adoption of such experiments as a system; he alluded to the improvement of juvenile criminals by industrial training. When the Parkhurst Prison Act was about being passed some ten years ago, a clause was introduced by Lord Lyndhurst and Lord Devon, the effect of which was to give the Government the power of granting conditional pardons to such children under fourteen years of age as were taken into the charge of charitable and benevolent institutions with a view to reformation, those institutions or societies having over such children the same authority as that of a master over an apprentice, and that clause, at the time, he considered to be a most valuable one, and for about six months after the act was passed it was acted upon and carried out with great success. However, the prisons inspectors impressed upon the Government that these children were children of the State and not fit objects for the exercise of private benevolence, and the consequence of this was that the clause referred to became inoperative. He alluded to this subject in a charge last year, and, though he was far from saying that that allusion had called the attention of the Government to it, this he could say, and had great pleasure in saying, that the plan was again in operation. Sir George Grey, the Secretary of State (than whom no man in England desired more to apply an effectual remedy to this serious evil) had directed a number of boys to be sent from Parkhurst to the Philanthropic Farm School at Redhill, to try the effects of the system pursued there, and unquestionably the results would be of a most successful character. As shewing the manner in which opinions changed on popular subjects, he might say that this change was now approved by the prisons inspectors, by whom it was before condemned, and thus is appeared that they now saw the necessity of children being treated as children, and not subjected to a penal discipline. One of the boys that had been selected was sentenced in that court to transportation, and that boy, though not twelve years old, had been convicted no less than 14 or 15 times. By industrial training and moral teaching, much good might be done, and he sincerely hoped that this new state of things was the dawn of a day the sun-light reformation of which would eradicate and blot out from our criminal law the opprobium which, in respect of juvenile criminals, attached to it.

The grand jury then retired.
