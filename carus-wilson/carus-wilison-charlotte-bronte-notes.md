# The Cowen Bridge School Controversy

In what was to be W. Carus Wilson's final year, one of his original projects would see his name and character being challenged in the national press. The trigger was the publication of a biography of a renowned literary figure, a certain Currer Bell, also known as Charlotte Brontë. Currer Bell's first work, *Jane Eyre*, had featured a certain school for the children of clerics, and its overly religious founder, in less than complementary terms. And Charlotte Brontë's biographer, Mrs. Gaskell, had been even more damning in her characterisation of the real world inspiration for both the school and its founder.

JANE EYRE: AN AUTOBIOGRAPHY. Edited by CURRER BELL. 3 vols. Published: October, 1847


Charlotte Bronte died March 31st, 1855.

THE AUTHOR OF JANE EYRE ( From Sharpe's Magazine )

On the northern side of one of the wildest and bleakest moors of Yorkshire, stands the little village of Haworth, consisting of church and few gray stone cottages. One of these, scarcely superior to its fellows, and distinguished only by a sort of courtyard surrounded a low stone wall, and overgrown with grass (shrubs and refusing vegetate ungenial atmosphere), the parsonage. The architecture is of the simplest description—a straight walk leads up to the front door, either aide of which appears a window, that of the sitting room looking into the churchyard, well filled with gravestones. On this parsonage, until within a few mouths since, not a touch of paint, nor article of new furniture, had been expended for thirty years, the period which has elapsed since the death of Miss Bronte's mother. Some six or seven years antecedent to that date, Irish clergyman, the Rev. Patrick Bronte, then resident at Penzance, espoused a young lady, contrary to the wishes of her relations, who refused to hold any intercourse with her after her marriage. Her husband, obtaining the perpetual curacy of Haworth, took his bride to his new residence, where she spent the remainder her days, dying in a rapid consumption after the birth of her sixth child, Charlotte. Mr Bronte, who, though advanced in years, is still alive, is described as a man of studious and solitary habits, and of singular and highly eccentric turn of mind, which, together with a very peculiar temper, must have rendered him anything but a suitable guardian to a youthful family. Nor can we wonder at the mother's dying exclamation, "What will become of my poor children !" Engrossed by his own pursuits, the father never even dined with his family nor taught them anything, and the children learned to write and read from servants only. When Charlotte was twelve years old, she (even then of an original and self-reliant nature) asked and obtained her father's permission, that her sisters and herself should be placed at the clergy school Cowan Bridge. This, as it then existed, she has described to the life in "Jane Eyre." Two of her sisters died of the fever which one time devastated the school; the two others, and probably Charlotte herself, quitted it with the seeds of consumption in their constitutions, fostered by the cruel privations they underwent. The food was horrible, and of it, bad as it was, they obtained so little that often they were literally half starved. Frequently has she "crept under the table to pick up the crumbs others had dropped." At the time of the fever the doctor examined the food; he put some in his mouth, and hastily rejecting it, protesting it was not fit for dogs. "So hungry was I," said Charlotte, "that I could have eaten what he threw away." The three survivors returned to Haworth with broken health; but there fresh trials awaited him. "At nineteen," continued Charlotte, "I should have been thankful fur a penny a week. I asked my father; but he said 'What women want with money ?' She was yet only nineteen when she advertised for and obtained situation as teacher in a school; not finding it turn out she had hoped, she waited until she had saved money enough to pay her passage to Brussels, where she had secured a position as school teacher—she started alone, never having previously quitted Yorkshire. When she arrived in London it was night; she became alarmed, and, not knowing where to go, and fearing to trust herself with strangers, she took a cab, drove to the Tower Stairs, hired a boat, and was conveyed to the Ostend packet. At first, the officer in command refused to take her on board till the next morning, but on learning her desolate situation, recalled his prohibition. In Brussels she remained two years; her experiences there are detailed in "Villette." The character of "Adele," in particular, is drawn from life. On her return, she found that the health of her two remaining sisters was declining, and that her father's eyesight was becoming affected, and she considered it her duty to remain at home. She tried various ways of increasing their income, but failed in all. Without mentioning her project to her father, she wrote "Jane Eyre," a work of which Messrs. Smith and Elder had the good sense to perceive the merits, and were courageous enough to publish it, in spite of its peculiarities, which might have alarmed any but a really spirited publisher. About three months after the appearance of her novel, and when its success was no longer doubtful, Miss Bronte resolved to screw up her courage, and inform her father of the step she had taken. Mr Bronte, it appears, did not then join his family, even at meal-times. At dinner, Charlotte announced her intention to her sisters, adding, that she would put it into execution before tea! Accordingly, she marched into his study with a copy her work, wrapped up in review it, which she had received, and the following conversation ensued :—

"Papa, I have been writing a book!"

"Have you, dear!" (He went on reading)

"But, papa, I want you to look at it."

"I can't be troubled to read a manuscript."

"But it is printed."

"I hope you're not been involving yourself in any such silly expense."

"I think 1 shall gain some money by it; may I read you some reviews of it!" She read the reviews, and again asked him if he would look over the book; he said she might leave it, and he would see. Later on that same evening he sent his daughters an invitation to drink tea with him. When the meal was nearly concluded, he said: "Children, Charlotte has been writing a book, and I think it is a better one than I expected." For some years he never mentioned the subject again.

A lady, who afterwards became intimate with Miss Bronte, thus describes her first introduction to her. "I arrived late at the house of a mutual friend, tea was on the table, and behind it sat a little wee dark person, dressed in black, who scarcely spoke, so that I had time for a good look at her. She had soft lightish brown hair, eyes of the same tint, looking straight at you, and very good and expressive; reddish complexion, a wide mouth—altogether plain; the forehead square, broad, and rather overhanging. Her hands are like birds' claws, and she is so shortsighted that she cannot see your face unless you are close to her. She is said to be frightfully shy, and almost cries at the thought of going amongst strangers." *Article: A Few Words About Jane Eyre.*

Lancaster Guardian - Saturday 02 June 1855

KIRKBY LONSDALE.

Rev. W. C. Wilson. — During the last few days, the Rev. Carus Wilson, has been paying a visit to Casterton Hall, his native place, after an absence of six years. His presence at Casterton, in the schools, we doubt not, would be very gratifying, and we are informed he expressed himself delighted with the manner in which they are at present conducted. He preached in the chapel of the above place on Sunday last, the 27th inst, to very crowded congregation from the words, "When the son of man cometh, will he find faith on the earth." This discourse was earnest, and eloquent, and could not fail but make a deep impression all present.

The original article https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=nyp.33433081661807&seq=372&q1=jane+eyre 1855 has a longer opening, commenting on the reception that "Jane Eyre" received when it was first published, as well as an extra closing paragraph, which was as follows:

> Such are a few particulars concerning this remarkable woman; with the broader features of her history, especially her marriage with Mr. Nicol, her father's curate, and her melancholy death six months after she (probably for the first time in her strange eventful life) knew what it was to enjoy domestic happiness — the daily press had already made everyone familiar. That she has been taken from us in the full vigour of her intellect, ere the sunshine of a happy home had fostered and developed the brighter and more genial portion of her nature, must ever be a source of regret to those who, admiring as we admire the works she has left as her lasting memorial, hoped for yet nobler proofs of her remarkable powers of invention, when time and an increased knowledge of life should have corrected the eccentricity, without lessening the originality, of her genius.

Jane Eyre - Lowood, Mr Brocklehurst

According to [BBC Bitesize revision notes](https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/guides/zsrktyc/revision/8):

> Mr Brocklehurst, a clergyman, is the supervisor of Lowood School. He is mean, vindictive and enjoys making the girls quiver in his presence. He enjoys the power he has and enjoys doling out punishments.
>
> Brocklehurst wants the pupils of Lowood School to be modest and pious and he cruelly restricts their food rations. This is hypocritical, as his family enjoys very fine things and is not deprived of anything.

CHAPTER IV.

...

... [A] year or so before this time, a school had been begun in the North of England for the daughters of clergymen. The place was Cowan's Bridge, a small hamlet on the coach-road between Leeds and Kendal, and thus easy of access from Haworth, as the coach ran daily, and one of its stages was at Keighley. The yearly expense for each pupil (according to the entrance-rules given in the Report for 1842, and I believe they had not been increased since the establishment of the schools in 1823) was as follows: —

"Rule 11. The terms for clothing:, lodging; boarding, and educating, are 14l. a year; half to be paid in advance, when the pupils are sent; and also 1l. entrance money, for the use of books, &c. The system of education comprehend? history, geography, the use of the globes, grammar, writing and arithmetic, all kinds of needlework, and the nicer kinds of household work — such as getting up fine linen, ironing, &c. If accomplishments are required, an additional charge of SI. a year is made for music or drawing, each."

Rule 3d requests that the friends will state the line of education desired in the case of every pupil, having a prospective regard to her future prospects.

Rule 4th states the clothing and toilette articles which a girl is expected to bring with her; and thus concludes: "The pupils all appear in the same dress. They wear plain straw cottage bonnets, in summer white frocks on Sundays, and nankeen on other days; in winter, purple stuff frocks, and purple cloth cloaks. For the sake of uniformity, therefore, they are required to bring ol. in lieu of frocks, pelisse, bonnet, tippet, and frills; making the whole sum which each pupil brings with her to the school —

7l half-year in advance.  
1l. entrance for books.  
1l. entrance for clothes.

The 8th rule is — "All letters and parcels are inspected by the superintendent;" but this is a very prevalent regulation in all young ladies' schools, where I think it is generally understood that the schoolmistress may exercise this privilege, although it is certainly unwise in her to insist too frequently upon it.

There is nothing at all remarkable in any of the other regulations, a copy of which was doubtless in Mr. Bronte's hands when he formed the determination to send his daughters to Cowan's Bridge School; and he accordingly took Maria and Elizabeth thither in July, 1824.

I now come to a part of my subject which I find great difficulty in treating, because the evidence relating to it on each side is so conflicting that it seems almost impossible to arrive at the truth. Miss Bronte more than once said to me, that she should not have written what she did of Lowood in "Jane Eyre," if she had thought the place would have been so immediately identified with Cowan's Bridge, although there was not a word in her account of the institution but what was true at the time when she knew it; she also said that she had not considered it necessary, in a work of fiction, to state every particular with the impartiality that might be required in a court of justice, nor to seek out motives, and make allowances for human feelings, as she might have done, if dispassionately analyzing the conduct of those who had the superintendence of the institution. I believe she herself would have been glad of an opportunity to correct the over-strong impression which was made upon the public mind by her vivid picture, though even she, suffer- ing her whole life long, both in heart and body, from the consequences of what happened there, might have been apt, to the last, to take her deep belief in facts for the facts themselves— her conception of truth for the absolute truth.

A wealthy clergyman, living near Kirby Lonsdale, the Reverend William Carus Wilson, was the prime mover in the establishment of this school. He was an energetic man, sparing no labour for the accomplishment of his ends, and willing to sacrifice everything but power. He saw that it was an extremely difficult task for clergymen with limited incomes to provide for the education of their children; and he devised a scheme, by which a certain sum was raised annually in subscription, to complete the amount required to furnish a solid and sufficient English education, for which the parent's payment of 14l. a year would not have been sufficient. Indeed that made by the parents was considered to be exclusively appropriated to the expenses of lodging and boarding, and the education provided for by the subscriptions. Twelve trustees, were appointed; Mr. Wilson being not only a trustee, but the treasurer and secretary; in fact, taking most of the business arrangements upon himself; a responsibility which appropriately fell to him, as he lived nearer the school than any one else who was interested in it. So his character for prudence and judgment was to a certain degree implicated in the success or failure of Cowan's Bridge School; and the working of it was for many years the great object and interest of his life. But he was apparently unacquainted with the prime element in good administration — seeking out thoroughly competent persons to fill each department, and then making them responsible for, and judging them by, the result, without perpetual and injudicious interference with the details. So great was the amount of good which Mr. Wilson did, by his constant, unwearied superintendence, that I cannot help feeling sorry that, in his old age and declining health, the errors, which he certainly committed, should have been brought up against him in a form which received such wonderful force from the touch of Miss Bronte's great genius. As I write, I have before me his last words on giving up the secretaryship in 1850 — he speaks of the "withdrawal, from declining health, of an eye, which, at all events, has loved to watch over the schools with an honest and anxious interest," — and again he adds, "that he resigns, therefore, with a desire to be thankful for all that God has been pleased to accomplish through his instrumentality (the infirmities and unworthinesses of which he deeply feels and deplores.)"

Cowan's Bridge is a cluster of some six or seven cottages, gathered together at both ends of a bridge, over which the high road from Leeds to Kendal crosses a little stream, called the Leek. This high road is nearly disused now; but formerly, when the buyers from the West Riding manufacturing districts had frequent occasion to go up into the North to purchase the wool of the Westmoreland and Cumberland farmers, it was doubtless much travelled; and perhaps the hamlet of Cowan's Bridge had a more prosperous look than it bears at present. It is prettily situated; just where the Leck-fells swoop into the plain; and by the course of the beck alder-trees and willows and hazel bushes grow. The current of the stream is interrupted by broken pieces of grey rock; and the waters flow over a bed of large round white pebbles, which a flood heaves up and moves on either side out of its impetuous way till in some parts they almost form a wall. By the side of the little, shallow, sparkling, vigorous Leek, run long pasture fields, of the fine short grass common in high land; for though Cowan's Bridge is situated on a plain, it is a plain from which there is many a fall and long descent before you and the Leek reach the valley of the Lune. I can hardly understand how the school there came to be so unhealthy, the air all round about was so sweet and thyme-scented, when I visited it last summer. But at this day, every one knows that the site of a building intended for numbers should be chosen with far greater care than that of a private house, from the tendency to illness, both infectious and otherwise, produced by the congregation of people in close proximity.

The house is still remaining that formed part of that occupied by the school. It is a long, low bow-windowed cottage, now divided into two dwellings. It stands facing the Leek, between which and it intervenes a space, about seventy yards deep, that was once the school garden. Running from this building, at right angles with what now remains of the school-house, there was formerly a bobbin-mill connected with the stream, where wooden reels were made out of the alders which grow profusely in such ground as that surrounding Cowan's Bridge.   Mr. Wilson adapted this mill t© his purpose; there were school-rooms on the lower floor, and dormitories on the upper. The present cottage was occupied by the teachers' rooms, the dining-room and kitchens, and some smaller bed-rooms. On going into this building, I found one part, that nearest to the high road, converted into a poor kind of public-house, then to let, and having all the squalid appearance of a deserted place, which rendered it difficult to judge what it would look like when neatly kept up, the broken panes replaced in the windows, and the rough-cast (now cracked and discoloured) made white and whole. The other end forms a cottage, with the low ceilings and stone floors of a hundred years ago; the windows do not open freely and widely; and the passage up- stairs, leading to the bed-rooms, is narrow and tortuous; altogether, smells would linger about the house, and damp cling to it. But sanitary matters were little understood thirty years ago; and it was a great thing to get a roomy building close to the high road, and not too far from the habitation of Mr. Wilson, the originator of the educational scheme. There was much need of such an institution; numbers of ill-paid clergymen hailed the prospect with joy, and eagerly put down the names of their children as pupils when the establishment should be ready to receive them. Mr. Wilson was, no doubt, pleased by the impatience with which the realization of his idea was anticipated, and opened the school with less than a hundred pounds in hand, and, as far as I can make out, from seventy to eighty pupils.

Mr. Wilson felt, most probably, that the responsibility of the whole plan rested upon him. The payment made by the parents was barely enough for food and lodging; the subscriptions did not flow very freely into an untried scheme; and great economy was necessary in all the domestic arrangements. He determined to enforce this by frequent personal inspection; and his love of authority seems to have led to great deal of unnecessary and irritating meddling with little matters. Yet, although there was economy in providing for the household, there does not appear to have been any parsimony. The meat, flour, milk, &c., were contracted for, but were of very fair quality; and the dietary, which has been shown to me in manuscript, was neither bad nor unwholesome; nor, on the whole, was it wanting in variety. Oat-meal porridge for breakfast; a piece of oat-cake for those who required luncheon; baked and boiled beef, and mutton, potato-pie, and plain homely puddings of different kinds for dinner. At five o'clock, bread and milk for the younger ones; and one piece of bread (this was the only time at which the food was limited) for the elder pupils, who sat up till a later meal of the same description. Mr. Wilton himself ordered in the food, and was anxious that it should be of good quality. But the cook, who had much of his confidence, and against whom for a long time no one durst utter a complaint, was careless, dirty, and wasteful. To some children oatmeal porridge is distasteful, and consequently unwholesome, even when properly made; at Cowan's Bridge School it was too often sent up, not merely burnt, but with offensive fragments of other substances discoverable in it. The beef, that should have been carefully salted before it was dressed, had often become tainted from neglect; and girls, who were schoolfellows with the Brontes, during the reign of the cook of whom I am speaking, tell me that the house seemed to be pervaded, morning, noon, and night, by the odour of rancid fat that steamed out of the oven in which much of their food was prepared, There was the same carelessness in making the puddings; one of those ordered was rice boiled in water, and eaten with a sauce of treacle and sugar; but it was often uneatable, because the water had been taken out of the rain-tub, and was strongly impregnated with the dust lodging on the roof, whence it had trickled down into the old wooden cask, which also added its own flavour to that of the original rain water. The milk, too, was often "bingy," to use a country expression for a kind of taint that is far worse than sourness, and suggests the idea that it is caused by want of cleanliness about the milk pans, rather than by the heat of the weather. On Saturdays, a kind of pie, or mixture of potatoes and meat, was served up, which was made of all the fragments accumulated during the week. Scraps of meat from a dirty and disorderly larder, could never be very appetizing; and, I believe, that this dinner was more loathed than any in the early days of Cowan's Bridge School. One may fancy how repulsive such fare would be to children whose appetites were small, and who had been accustomed to food, far simpler perhaps, but prepared with a delicate cleanliness that made it both tempting and wholesome. Many a meal the little Brontes went without food, although craving with hunger. They were not strong when they came, having only just recovered from a complication of measles and hooping-cough; indeed, I suspect they had scarcely recovered; for there was some consultation on the part of the school authorities whether Maria and Elizabeth should be received or not, in July 1824, Mr. Bronte came again, in the September of that year, bringing with him Charlotte and Emily to be admitted as pupils.

It appears strange that Mr. Wilson should not have been informed by the teachers of the way in which the food was served up; but we must remember that the cook had been known for some time to the Wilson family, while the teachers were brought together for an entirely different work — that of education. They were expressly given to understand that such was their department; the buying in and management of the provisions rested with Mr. Wilson and the cook. The teachers would, of course, be unwilling to lay any com- plaints on the subject before him; and when he heard of them, Ms reply was to the effect that the children were to be trained up to regard higher things than dainty pampering of the appetite, and (apparently unconscious of the fact, that daily loathing and rejection of food is sure to undermine the health) he lectured them on the sin of caring over-much for carnal things.

There was another trial of health common to all the girls. The path from Cowan's Bridge to Tunstall Church, where Mr. Wilson preached, and where they all attended on the Sunday, is more than two miles in length, and goes sweeping along the rise and fall of the unsheltered country, in a way to make it a fresh and exhilarating walk in summer, but a bitter cold one in winter, especially to children whose thin blood flowed languidly in consequence of their half-starved condition. The church was not warmed, there being no means for this purpose. It stands in the midst of fields, and the damp mists must have gathered round the walls, and crept in at the windows. The girls took their cold dinner with them, and ate it between the services, in a chamber over the entrance, opening out of the former galleries. The arrangements for this day were peculiarly trying to delicate children, particularly to those who were spiritless, and longing for home, as poor Maria Bronte must have been. For her ill health was increasing; the old cough, the remains of the hooping-cough, lingered about her; she was far superior in mind to any of her play-fellows and companions, and was lonely amongst them from that very cause; and yet she had faults so annoying that she was in constant disgrace with her teachers, and an object of merciless dislike to one of them, who is depicted as "Miss Scatcherd" in "Jane Eyre," and whose real name I will be merciful enough not to disclose. I need hardly say, that Helen Burns is as exact a transcript of Maria Bronte as Charlotte's wonderful power of reproducing character could give. Her heart, to the latest day on which we met, still beat with unavailing indignation at the worrying and the cruelty to which her gentle, patient, dying sister had been subjected by this woman. Not a word of that part of "Jane Eyre" but is a literal repetition of scenes between the pupil and the teacher. Those who had been pupils at the same time knew who must have written the book, from the force with which Helen Burns' sufferings are described. They had, before that, recognized the description of the sweet dignity and benevolence of Miss Temple as only a just tribute to the merits of one whom all that knew her appear to hold in honour; but when Miss Scatcherd was held up to opprobrium they also recognized in the writer of "Jane Eyre" an unconsciously avenging sister of the sufferer.

One of these fellow-pupils of Charlotte and Maria Bronte's, among other statements even worse, gives me the following: — The dormitory in which Maria slept was a long- room, holding a row of narrow little beds on each side, occupied by the pupils; and at the end of this dormitory there was a small bed-chamber opening out of it, appropriated to the use of Miss Scatcherd. Maria's bed stood nearest to the door of this room. One morning, after she had become so- seriously unwell as to have had a blister applied to her side (the sore from which was not perfectly healed), when the getting-up bell was heard, poor Maria moaned out that she was so ill, so very ill, she wished she might stop in bed; and some of the girl? urged her to do so, and said they would explain it all to Miss Temple, the superintendent. But Miss Scatcherd was close at hand, and her anger would have to be faced before Miss Temple's kind thoughtfulness could interfere; so the sick child began to dress, shivering with cold, as, without leaving her bed, she slowly put on her black worsted stockings over her thin white legs (my informant spoke as if she saw it yet, and her whole face flushed out undying indignation). Just then Miss Scatcherd issued from her room, and, without asking for a word of explanation from the sick and frightened girl, she took her by the arm, on the side to which the blister had been applied, and by one vigorous movement whirled her out into the middle of the floor, abusing her all the time for dirty and untidy habits. There she left her. My informant says, Maria hardly spoke, except to beg some of the more indignant girls to be calm; but, in slow, trembling movements, with many a pause, she went down stairs at last, — and was punished for being too late.

Any one may fancy how such an event as this would rankle in Charlotte's mind. I only wonder that she did not remonstrate against her father's decision to send her and Emily back to Cowan's Bridge, after Maria's and Elizabeth's deaths. But frequently children are unconscious of the effect which some of their simple revelations would have in altering the opinions entertained by their friends of the persons placed around them. Besides, Charlotte's earnest vigorous mind saw, at an unusually early age, the immense importance of education, as furnishing her with tools which she had the strength and the will to wield, and she would be aware that the Cowan's Bridge education was, in many points, the best that her father could provide for her.

Before Maria Bronte's death, that low fever broke out, in the spring of 1825, which is spoken of in "Jane Eyre." Mr. Wilson was extremely alarmed at the first symptoms of this; his self-confidence was shaken; he did not understand what kind of illness it could be, that made the girls too dull and heavy to understand remonstrances, or be roused by texts and spiritual exhortation; but caused them to sink away into dull stupor, and half-unconscious listlessness. He went to a kind motherly woman, who had had some connection with the school — as laundress, I believe — and asked her to come and tell him what was the matter with them. She made herself ready, and drove with him in his gig. "When she entered the school-room, she saw from twelve to fifteen girls lying about; some resting their aching heads on the table, others on the ground; all heavy-eyed, flushed, indifferent, and weary, with pains in every limb. Some peculiar odour, she says, made her recognise that they were sickening for "the fever;" and she told Mr. Wilson so, and that she could not stay there for fear of conveying the infection to her own children; but he half commanded,  and half entreated her to remain and nurse them; and finally mounted his gig and drove away, while she was still urging that she must return to her own house, and to her domestic duties, for which she had provided no substitute. However, when she was left in this unceremonious manner, she determined to make the best of it; and a most efficient nurse she proved, although, as she says, it was a dreary time. Mr. Wilson supplied every thing ordered by the doctors of the  best quality, and in the most liberal manner; he even sent for additional advice, in the person of his own brother-in-law, a very clever medical man in Kirby, with whom he had not been on good terms for some time previously; and it was this doctor who tasted and condemned the daily food of the girls by the expressive action of spitting out a portion which he had taken in order to taste it.   About forty of the girls suffered from this fever, but none of them died at Cowan's Bridge, though one died at her own home, sinking under the state of health which followed it. None of the Bronte's had the fever.   But the same causes, which affected the health of the other pupils through typhus, told more slowly, but not less surely, upon their constitutions. The principal of these causes was the food.

The bad management of the cook was chiefly to be blamed for this; she was dismissed, and the woman who had been forced against her will to serve as head nurse, took the place of housekeeper; and henceforward the food was so well prepared that no one could ever reasonably complain of it. Of course it cannot be expected that a new institution, comprising domestic and educational arrangements for nearly a hundred persons, should work quite smoothly at the beginning, and all this occurred during the first two years of the establishment. But Mr. Wilson seems to have had the unlucky gift of irritating even those to whom he meant kindly, and for whom he was making perpetual sacrifices of time and money, by never showing any respect for their independence of opinion and action. He had, too, so little knowledge of human nature as to imagine that, by constantly reminding the girls of their dependent position, and the fact that they were receiving their education from the charity of others, he could make them lowly and humble. Some of the more sensitive felt this treatment bitterly, and instead of being as grateful as they should have been for the real benefits they were obtaining, their mortified pride rose up from its fall a hundred-fold more strong. Painful impressions sink deep into the hearts of delicate and sickly children. What the healthy suffer from but momentarily, and then forget, those who are ailing brood over involuntarily, and remember long — perhaps with no resentment, but simply as a piece of suffering that has been stamped into their very life. The pictures. ideas, and conceptions of character received into the mind of the child of eight years old, were destined to be reproduced in fiery words a quarter of a century afterwards. She saw only one side, and that the unfavourable side of Mr. Wilson; but many of those who knew him, assure me of the wonderful fidelity with which his disagreeable qualities, his spiritual pride, his love of power, his ignorance of human nature and consequent want of tenderness are represented; while, at the same time, they regret that the delineation of these should have obliterated, as it were, nearly all that was noble and conscientious.

The recollections left of the four Bronte sisters at this period of their lives, on the minds of those who associated with them, are not very distinct. Wild, strong hearts, and powerful minds, were hidden under an enforced propriety and regularity of demeanour and expression, just as their faces had been concealed by their father, under his stiff, unchanging mask. Maria was delicate, unusually clever and thoughtful for her age, gentle, and untidy. Of her frequent disgrace from this last fault — of her sufferings, so patiently borne — I have already spoken. The only glimpse we get of Elizabeth, through the few years of her short life, is contained in a letter which I have received from Miss "Temple." "The second, Elizabeth, is the only one of the family of whom I have a vivid recollection, from her meeting with a somewhat alarming accident, in consequence of which I had her for some days and nights in my bed-room, not only for the sake of greater quiet, but that I might watch over her myself. Her head was severely cut, but she bore all the consequent suffering with exemplary patience, and by it won much upon my esteem. Of the two younger ones (if two there were) I have very slight recollections, save that one, a darling child, under five years of age, was quite the pet nursling of the schooL" This last would be Emily. Charlotte was considered the most talkative of the sisters — a "bright, clever little child." Her great friend was a certain "Mellany Hane" (so Mr. Bronte spells the name), a West Indian, whose brother paid for her schooling, and who had no remarkable talent except for music, which her brother's circumstances forbade her to cultivate. She was "a hungry, good-natured, ordinary girl;" older than Charlotte, and ever ready to protect her from any petty tyranny or encroachments on the part of the elder girls. Charlotte always remembered her with affection and gratitude.

I have  quoted the word "bright" in the account of Charlotte. I suspect that this year of 1825 was the last time it could ever be applied to her. In this spring, Maria became so rapidly worse that Mr. Bronte was sent for. He had not previously been aware of her illness, and the condition in which he found her was a terrible shock to him. He took her home by the Leeds coach, the girls crowding out into the road to follow her with their eyes over the bridge, past the cottages, and then out of sight for ever. She died a very few days after her arrival at home. Perhaps the news of her death, falling suddenly into the life of which her patient existence had formed a part, only a little week or so before, made those who remained at Cowan's Bridge look with more anxiety on Elizabeth's symptoms, which also turned out to be consumptive. She was sent home in charge of a confidential servant of the establishment; and she, too, died in the early summer of that year. Charlotte was thus suddenly called into the responsibilities of eldest sister in a motherless family. She remembered how anxiously her dear sister Maria had striven, in her grave earnest way, to be a tender helper and a counsellor to them all; and the duties that now fell upon her seemed almost like a legacy from the gentle little sufferer so lately dead.

Both Charlotte and Emily returned to school after the Midsummer holidays in this fatal year. But before the next winter, it was thought desirable to advise their removal from school, as it was evident that the damp situation of the house at Cowan's Bridge did not suit their health.

CHAPTER V.

For the reason just stated, the little girls were sent home in the autumn of 1825, when Charlotte was little more than nine years old.

The Life of Charlotte Brontë, Vol. II (1857) Elizabeth Gaskell

p28 commenting on reception of "Jane Eyre", Dec 1847

There is little record remaining of the manner in which the first news of its wonderful success reached and affected the one heart of the three sisters. I once asked Charlotte — we were talking about the description of Lowood school, and she was saying that she was not sure whether she should have written it, if she had been aware how instantaneously it would have been identified with Cowan Bridge — whether the popularity to which the novel attained had taken her by surprise. She hesitated a little, and then said: "I believed that what had impressed me so forcibly when I wrote it, must make a strong impression on any one who read it. I was not surprised at those who read 'Jane Eyre' being deeply interested in it; but I hardly expected that a book by an unknown author could find readers."


pp60-1

"July 28th.

"Branwell is the same in conduct as ever. His constitution seems much shattered. Papa, and sometimes all of us, have sad nights with him. He sleeps most of the day and consequently will lie awake at night. But has not every house its trial ?"

While her most intimate friends were yet in ignorance of the fact of her authorship of "Jane Eyre," she received a letter from one of them, making inquiries about Casterton School. It is but right to give her answer, written on August 28th, 1848.

"Since you wish to hear from me while you are from home, I will write without further delay. It often happens that when we linger at first in answering a friend's letter, obstacles occur to retard us to an inexcusably late period. In my last, I forgot to answer a question which you asked me, and was sorry afterwards for the omission. I will begin, therefore, by replying to it, though I fear what information I can give will come a little late. You said Mrs. ————— had some thoughts of sending ————— to school, and wished to know whether the Clergy Daughters' School at Casterton was an eligible place. My personal knowledge of that institution is very much out of date, being derived from the experience of twenty years ago. The establishment was at that time in its infancy, and a sad ricketty infancy it was. Typhus fever decimated the school periodically; and consumption and scrofula, in every variety of form bad air and water, bad and insufficient diet can generate, preyed on the ill-fated pupils. It would not then have been a fit place for any of Mrs. ——————'s children; but I understand it is very much altered for the better since those days. The school is removed from Cowan Bridge (a situation as unhealthy as it was picturesque —low, damp, beautiful with wood and water) to Casterton. The accommodations, the diet, the discipline, the system of tuition—all are, I believe, entirely altered and greatly improved. I was told that such pupils as behaved well, and remained at the school till their education was finished, were provided with situations as governesses, if they wished to adopt the vocation, and much care was exercised in the selection; it was added, that they were also furnished with an excellent wardrobe on leaving Casterton. ... . The oldest family in Haworth failed lately, and have quitted the neighbourhood where their fathers resided before them for, it is said, thirteen generations. . . . Papa, I am most thankful to say, continues in very good health, considering his age; his sight, too, rather, I think, improves than deteriorates. My sisters likewise are pretty well."

Concerted campaign against Gaskell's characterisation of W. Carus Wilson and the Cowan's Bridge School.

The following letter appeared widely.

Morning Herald (London) - Friday 24 April 1857

"JANE EYRE." TO THE EDITOR OF THE MORNING HERALD. Sir,—Allow me to make a few remarks on the "Life of Charlotte Bronte," by Mrs. Gaskell, which will be one of the popular works of the day.

I chiefly wish to call attention to the unfounded statements made on the Clergy Daughters' School, where Miss Bronte commenced her school career, when it was at Cowan Bridge.

I have seen letters from teachers and pupils who were there with her, denying all that she stated regarding that invaluable institution; and the lady who was superintendent at the time sent to a review, which was published, a long letter condemning the whole account in "Jane Eyre."

Miss Bronte left the school at the age of nine, Mrs. Gaskell tells us, so what judgment could she form? And her father being a very austere and peculiar man, denying his children animal food, and they all being naturally very delicate, as we read also in Mrs. Gaskell's work, is it fair to trace all her sufferings in after life to the very short time she was at the establishment, as Mrs. Gaskell also informs us?

The attack on my father, the Rev. W. Carus Wilson, coming from the pen of Mrs. Gaskell, who is, I believe, the wife of a Socinian preacher, is intended, from the strain of the whole work, as a sneer at the Evangelical party in the Church.

My father has spent a long life solely for the good of others; and though, from his independent position in life, and the wonderful way in which God has prospered every work he has undertaken for the good of the Church and his fellow creatures, he might have much to boast of, yet I can truly say there lives not a man with a lower opinion of himself, or more opposite to the character Mrs. Gaskell has sketched of him.

Your obedient servant,  
W. W. CARUS WILSON.

CHARLOTTE BRONTE. TO THE EDITORS OF THE LEEDS MERCURY. GENTLEMEN,—

May I ask for a corner for the following, taken out of a Review, which is a complete answer to the Statements in the Life of Charlotte Bronte regarding my father's charitable institutions.— Yours,  
W. W. CARUS WILSON.

NEW PUBLICATION

The Life of Charlotte Bronte. "By Mrs. Gaskell, London: Smith, Elder, and Co.

Those who have enjoyed the literary luxury of such works as "Jane Eyre," "Shirley," and "Villette," will peruse with much interest the life of their gifted authoress. Mrs. Gaskell has given to the public a deeply-interesting memoir, and we can hardly realize the mournful fact that Charlotte Bronte now sleeps beneath those wild Yorkshire hills that nursed her genius. But such is the case, and the pen of praise or blame will fall but lightly now upon her tomb.

We remember that on the appearance of "Jane Eyre," it was severely censured by the Quarterly, the Times, and other leading reviews and papers, for its coarse expressions and immoral tendencies. There was a profanity prevading many of its pages, and we grieve to find the same irreverent turn given to passages from Scripture in some parts of Miss Bronte's letters, which appear in her Life by Mrs. Gaskell, and which will make this certainly most touching memoir a prohibited book with many, as was "Jane Eyre." Such expressions, for instance, as the following:— Miss Bronte, in writing to a friend, addresses her as only "a little lower than the angels." Again, in pointing to a picture of Thackeray, for whom she had unbounded worship, she exclaimed to a friend, "A lion shall come out of Judah." Too many other passages of a similar strain in this work could be quoted. It is the Rev. H. Melvill who observes that "it is to sharpen every arrow of the devil to sharpen our wit on the Bible;" and we cannot see how any one can imagine that the insertion of irreverent expressions can in any tale or memoir add force or interest.

The closing hour, pictured by Mrs. Gaskell, is very painful. Miss Bronte entered into eternity, not with the bright light and joy that cheered and comforted "Leila Ada," or an "Adelaide Newton," but with the simple exclamation (her last on earth) to her husband, "Oh, I am not going to die, am I?— He won't separate us, we have been so happy together!"

She could not have been without religious impressions; we may be sure that in such au establishment as the "Clergy Daughters' School" the seeds of good must have been sown in her; but we fear her great talents were a snare— they were not used in after-life for the glory and honour of her God. Can we wonder, then, at the bitter attack she made in "Jane Eyre" on the "Clergy Daughters' School," and on the Rev. W. Carus Wilson, its benevolent founder? And, if report be true that Mrs. Gaskell is a Socinian, does she seek to aim a blow at our Church by such unjust and quite unnecessary personal remarks on so influential a member of it?

No one can have laboured so publicly and usefully for the cause of evangelical truth as the Rev. W. Carus Wilson has done without meeting with opponents, and perhaps enemies— but, we are informed by those best capable of judging, that the character sketched of him by Mrs. Gaskell is as false as the assertions about the school at Cowan Bridge.

With much that many might boast of, and envy, the wonderful way in which God has prospered every work he has undertaken, whether it be as regards the charitable institutions he established about 30 years ago; or his periodicals that so many have owed their conversion to; or the churches entrusted to him (in the building of some of which he was instrumental); or whether as regards his independent fortune, which raises him far above the malicious insinuations of Miss Bronte, that the pupils in the charitable institutions under his control "were starved "—yet we are assured that no one has a lower opinion of himself than Mr. Wilson, or a deeper feeling of the little he has done, now, at the close of a long life, spent only for the good of his fellow-creatures.

Mrs. Gaskell, knowing nothing of him or the schools personally, must have grounded her remarks as to his "love of power", his "spiritual pride," his reminding the pupils of their "dependent condition" (a thing most opposite to his nature, for no one was more beloved by them), on the testimony of some enemy, perhaps a turned-off teacher or pupil.

Now, we are in a position to state that when "Jane Eyre" came out many old pupils and teachers, who were at Cowan Bridge when Miss Bronte was there, wrote to Mr. Wilson's family, denying and grieving over her statements as to "bad diet and treatment," &c; and the lady who was the superintendent of that institution in 1824 (whose husband now heads a college in America) wrote in 1855 a long and complete answer to all the assertions in "Jane Eyre." and her able letter appeared in a Review. We wish we could have inserted all this important letter, but we have only space for the following extract. She says: —

"The columns of the leading papers have been for some time past much occupied with obituary notices of the late Miss Bronte and many conveying the impression that her treatment at the Clergy Daughters' School when at Cowan Bridge, was of a character not only to affect her health, but to darken her prospects in afterlife. Now, as I have it in my power entirely to refute these charges. I should consider myself guilty in a measure concerning them, did I not make known to the world the truth of the case, and thereby exonerate an excellent and eminently useful clergyman from the imputations cast on him in 'Jane Eyre,' as well as to vindicate an institution which has been to the Poverty-stricken clergy a blessing of inestimable value."

She then goes on to say —

"In July, 1824, the Rev. Mr. Bronte arrived at Cowan Bridge with two of his daughters, Maria and Elizabeth; the children were so delicate that there were doubts whether they could be admitted into the school. They were received, and went on so well that their father brought in September two more, Charlotte and Emily. During both these visits Mr. Bronte stayed at the school, sat at the table with the pupils, and saw the whole routine of the establishment. They all inherited consumption from their mother and were taken home; none of them, as has been stated, had any attack of fever or died at the school. I can truly say that none of the pupils were denied a sufficient quantity of food; they were never limited; meat, vegetable, and puddings daily in abundance; any statement to the contrary is most false. Charlotte was a bright, clever, happy little girl, never in disgrace. In size remarkably diminutive, and if, as has been asserted, she never grew an inch after leaving the school, she must have been a literal dwarf. * * * Let us hope that in caricaturing an institution which has been such a blessing to the daughters of her own Church she had no injurious motives, but, misled by a vivid imagination, and a dim recollection of thirty years, when she was but a child, she published in an unguarded moment, unmindful of the consequences, mis-statements, the tendency of which has been to calumniate a most excellent institution, and to bring disgrace on religion. * * * When it is known that I have been absent 12 years from my native land, and 10 years previously had withdrawn, from conscientious motives from the Church of England, I think I need not fear being considered a partisan; my only object is to do justice, and to state to the public things as they have been and are."

The whole of this letter Mrs. Gaskell must have seen, as she quotes one sentence out of it word for word, but has carefully suppressed all in it that bears so favourably on the school. She allows "it is a subject she approaches with the greatest difficulty"; and, admitting an improvement in the school seems greatly puzzled how to do this, and yet defend her friend's assertions in "Jane Eyre."

With the above we would take the testimony of hundreds of pupils, who with their parents have gratefully acknowledged the advantages they received at these institutions, rather than the account of one, however talented, who when but a child of nine left the establishment, and has so ungenerously cast an odium upon him who first planned such a help to our poorer clergy, and who has yearly undertaken the risk of the support of near 800 pupils and teachers; for, including a preparatory school, there are about 150 daughters of clergymen boarded, clothed, and educated, at only £14 a-year each, including everything, and, in the "Servants' School," above 100 girls trained for service, each paying but £10 a-year. The schools are situated in Westmoreland, built on Mr. Carus Wilson's property, half-a-mile from Casterton Hall, his residence. They stand amid beautiful scenery, on high and healthy situations. They require above £1,000 a-year, in addition to the payment of the pupils, to cover all expenses.

We read further in the "Life" that Mr. Bronte was an austere and peculiar man, denying his children animal food, &c., and that they were all naturally very delicate. It is hardly fair then to trace, as is done, all Miss Bronte's after-sufferings to Cowan Bridge. The statement, too, is false, that "fever decimated the pupils yearly ;" there have been but two attacks since the schools were established, which only carried off 6 pupils.

Mrs. Gaskell says that Miss Bronte often regretted her remarks in "Jane Eyre" about the school, as she never thought it would have been so identified. Why then should Mrs. Gaskell have continued them in the "Life". Would it not have been fairer to have given a fuller and more favourable account of the schools; for in her visit to Cowan Bridge last year, so close to Casterton, she most probably would have visited them, and witnessed their flourishing condition under the able management of a committee, during Mr. Wilson's long absence from ill health? We have not space at present to touch on any parts of the second volume of this popular work, and have only dwelt on those in the first that we consider most open to criticism.

Were the work free from those objectionable points it might be capable of good; for who can picture the struggles of the suffering sisters, lonely and friendless, in the seclusion of Haworth Parsonage; their affliction with their brother (so public a notice of whom we think a great pity); their resignation and devotion to their father, and not extol that peculiar ardour which led them to overcome every obstacle, and to cast such a meteor on the crowded paths of literature? Much as we must admire Miss Bronte's genius we cannot altogether eulogise her character; it seems to have imbibed the coldness and isolation of Haworth. But when we consider her solitude and sufferings we are the more disposed to draw the curtain over much we could have wished otherwise, beyond what we have noticed, in one so gifted, and who by her pen has shed such lustre on the literary world.

Note.— The substance of the above Review, in the shape of a letter, has appeared in the Times, Morning Herald. Daily News, Record, and other papers.

Leeds Mercury - Saturday 23 May 1857

CHARLOTTE BRONTE. TO THE EDITORS OF THE LEEDS MERCURY. GENTLEMEN,-On Saturday last, you published, by request of Mr. W. W. Carus Wilson, an extract from a review, coutaining, he says, "a complete answer to the statements regarding his father's charitable institutions."

The statements referred to are, I presume, the following: that the unhealthy situation of Cowan Bridge, unwholesome food, and exposure to cold, &c., enfeebled the girls and pre-disposed them to disease; that fever broke out among them; that about forty of them suffered from it; that the surgeon, who was called in, condemned the girls' daily food by the expressive action of spitting out a portion of it which he had taken in order to taste it; that the school was removed to a new situation and a committee of management appointed.

Now let us examine the "Complete answer," and see how these charges are disposed of. And first, the reviewer assumes that these statements rest solely on the testimony "of one who, when but a child of nine, left the establishment." A reference, however, to "The Life of Charlotte it Bronte," will show that this is a *false* assumption. He praises the situation of the school, "on Mr. Carus Wilson's property, half a mile from Casterton-hall, high and healthy ;" but he has not the candour to state that this description applies to the present site, and *not to that referred to in "Jane Eyre."*

He eulogises Mr. Wilson's liberality, but omits to state that funds are raised from the public for the support of the establishment, which Mr. W. W. Carus Wilson modestly calls his "father's charitable institutions."

He makes *no mention whatever* of the condemnation of the food by the medical gentleman, of the fever which scourged the school, and the consequent change of site, and reformation of the establishment.

But, surely, the lady superintendent, "whose able letter appeared in a review," will supply the gentleman's omissions, and in her "long and complete answer to the assertions in Jane Eyre," make some reference to this eventful period in the existence of "the clergy daughters' school." She does no such thing, at least as quoted in the review.

She eulogises Mr. Wilson; asseverates her own impartiality; refers to her apostasy from her Church, and expatriation from her country; makes a somewhat erroneous statement respecting Mr. Bronte's family; hazards some conjectures about the intentions of the author of "Jane Eyre ;" and lays before us a bill of fare at Cowan Bridge- "meat, vegetables, and puddings daily in abundance." Very good, Madam! but what about the cooking that spoiled these provisions; boiled the puddings in unclean water; compounded the Saturday's nauseous mess from the fragments accumulated in a dirty larder during the week; and too often sent up the porridge, not merely burnt, but with offensive fragments of other substances discoverable in it?

The Reviewer says "the whole of this letter Mrs. Gaskell must have seen, as she quotes one sentence out of it word for word." Whether Mrs. Gaskell has seen this letter, I do not know; but if the Reviewer will refer to "The Life," vol. i., page 78, he will find that Mrs. Gaskell quotes from a letter which she had herself received from the same lady, who evidently in both instances used the same form of expression—identical, however, in only *three* words, "bright, clever. little"—in reference to the same child. May I not justly retort the charge of disingenuousness on the Reviewer; who must have known this, when he accused Mrs. Gaskell of making a garbled quotation?

"Jane Eyre" was published in 1847; Lowood was almost immediately identified with Cowan Bridge, yet "The Lady who was superintendent in 1824" was discreetly silent for more than seven years, until, in fact, the author was laid in her grave. So were Mr. W. W. Carus Wilson and the Reviewer, for aught I know. Their present proceedings are merely an illustration of a very old fable. To the day of her death "Currer Bell" maintained than the picture drawn in "Jane Eyre" was, on the whole, a true Picture of Cowan-bridge school, as she knew it by experience; that the institution was subsequently greatly improved she knew, and stated in the same work, in which she exposed its former mismanagement.

I am told that the Reviewer, referred to in this letter, has, with *exquisite taste* and *great charity*, alluded to the closing hours of my wife's life, describing them as painful. *Painful* indeed they were, but not in *his* sense of the term. On this subject I would say to him, "Who art thou that judgest another? Judge not that ye be not judged. First cast out the beam out of thine own eye; and then shalt thou see clearly to pull out the mote that is in thy brother's eye."

Trusting to your sense of justice to give this letter a place in your Saturday's impression,

I am, Gentlemen, your obedient servant,

A. B. NICHOLLS. Haworth Parsonage, May 20th, 1857.

Leeds Mercury - Thursday 28 May 1857

CHARLOTTE BRONTE. TO THE EDITORS OF THE LEEDS 3MERCURY. GENTLEMEN,— If you will allow me a reply to a letter from Mr. Nicholls, in yesterday's *Manchester Times* and to-day's *Leeds Mercury*, it shall be my last, and very brief. Mr. Nicholls is quite welcome to the "burnt pudding" fact, and to the testimony of the pupil who may, from a delicate constitution, have been as unfit as the Brontës were for any school. I cannot defend an isolated case of "wet feet," &c., in any school. But it is the charge of "bad and insufficient food" being a *general* thing that I am prepared to prove false by ten testimonies to every one Mr. Nicholls can show to the contrary.

That the school was removed at once in consequence of the fever and unhealthy site, as Mr. Nicholls states, is quite false. It was not removed till ten years after.

I could enter far more into detail had I space, but will conclude with the following extract out of a letter from my father to me.

"I can most truly say that every charge is false. Having suffered once myself at a school from bad food, I was specially sensitive on this point when I established the Cowan-bridge school. Often, when quite unexpected, have I sat down at meals with the pupils, and looked into the kitchen. As to my 'lecturing the children on the sin of caring for carnal things when the bad state of the food was represented to me,' I can positively declare that no complaint was *ever* made to me, neither did I ever see one cause for any complaint."

Let me tell Mr. Nicholls that his wife's sweeping and slanderous charges against my father and his institutions have been quite as painful to some, as the refutation of them has been to himself. Yours respectfully,  
W. W. CARUS WILSON. Weston-super-Mare, June 2.

Leeds Intelligencer - Saturday 30 May 1857

CHARLOTTE BRONTE. TO THE EDITOR OF THE INTELLIGENCER. Sir, —

If the Rev. Nicholls will refer to the refutation which in your paper of last Saturday he endeavours to answer, he will see that the reviewer particularly stated that he wished there had been space to have inserted *all* the letters of the lady who was over the Cowan Bridge School when Charlotte Bronte was there. In a former letter to you, the statements of the "half-starved" condition of the pupils were disposed of. If you will kindly give me room, I will quote for your readers that part of the letter which bears on the subject Mr. Nicholls says has been evaded, viz., the fever, and the spoiling of food. During the spring of 1825 a low fever, though not an alarming one (Mr. Nicholls says "it scourged the school") prevailed, and the managers naturally anxious to know if any local cause occasioned it asked the doctor's opinion of the food that happened to be on the table. I recollect he spoke rather scornfully of a baked rice pudding, but as the ingredients were rice, sugar, and milk, its effect could hardly have been so serious as have been affirmed. I thus furnish you with the simple fact from which these statements have been manufactured. I have not the least hesitation in saying that the comforts were as many, and the privations as few, at Cowan Bridge, as can well be found in so large an establishment. How far young and delicate children are able to contend with the necessary evils of a public school, is in my opinion a very grave question, and does not enter into the present discussion. Then again, "thoughtless servants will spoil food even in private families." In addition to the above, my father has denied the accounts in "Jane Eyre," and declared he was most particular about the food at Cowan Bridge.

I leave your readers to form their own judgment between the testimony of this lady and my father, and a child who left the institution when but nine years old.

If there are *any* besides, perhaps a dismissed pupil or teacher, who can bear out C. Bronte's assertions, there are many more Cowan Bridge pupils who have written to me, during the last month, saying "how happy they were there, how all loved my father, how entirely false the character Mrs. Gaskell has sketched of him, and how good the food was, better (some have said) than they have got at their own homes."

Mr. Nicholls complains of the expression, "my father's charitable institution." It was my father who first established them; had them built on his own property, collected single handed, for 30 years, all subscriptions for them, running the risk himself of their yearly support, and thereby doing for his brother clergy what no other man has done. No "committee of management was formed" till about six years ago, when ill-health obliged my father to live abroad. Mr. Nicholls also complains that in the refutation no mention is made of funds being raised yearly for the schools, and of their removal to Casterton. Both these facts are well known, and sufficiently attended to in the review. Mr. Nicholls is surprised that no defence was made on the publication of "Jane Eyre." But that was a novel, and persons and places were not publicly and certainly identified till the obituary notices of the press in 1855, and the Memoir of C. Bronte appeared. It was in 1855 that the letter of refutation was sent to review, by the lady who was over Cowan Bridge School when C. Bronte was there; who from conscientious motives left the Church of England, and who married the head of a college, in America, which Mr. Nicholls charitably calls "Apostacy and expatriation." It is only natural that Mr. Nicholls should seek to defend his wife's assertions; but considering that to add force to her fiction, she first cast odium on an invaluable institution, and a public benefactor to mankind, which, as Mrs. Gaskell says, she often regretted, I think Mr. Nicholls should be the first to share in that regret, and to repair the great injury that has been done.

Yours, W. W. CARUS WILSON.

Usk Observer - Saturday 30 May 1857

The publication of the life of CHARLOTTE BRONTE, and the charges contained in it against the Cowen-bridge School has led to a good deal of angry feeling. The Rev. H. Shepheard, M.A., late Fellow and Tutor of Oriel College, Oxford, Incumbent of Casterton, and Chaplain and Secretary of the Clergy Daughters' School, in a letter in Wednesday's *Times*, defends the school, which he says "has been carried on since 1833 at Casterton, and, to borrow the words of a Preston paper the vile attack made on the rev. gentleman (Mr. Carus Wilson) has reference to the Clergy Daughters' Schools; and, in consequence of what is said on the subject in the Bronte memoirs, some ignorant reviewers of the public press in London have arrived at the conclusion that at Cowen-bridge, or Casterton, "there exists," as observes the editor of the Lancaster Gazette, "a sort of Dotheboys' Hall. In this neighbourhood the interesting establishments alluded to are well known, and we can only smile at the verdancy of our London contemporaries," &c.' Now, sir, in the visitors' book of the Casterton school there appears the name of 'Mrs. Gaskill' as having visited the institution in March, 1856. She was shown over the whole house, saw the pupils, and expressed nothing but satisfaction. Would it not have been, then, an act of bare justice, as well an ingenuous and graceful acknowledgment, on her part, to have inserted in her memoir a frank avowal that whatever may have been the merits or demerits of the Cowen-bridge School of 1824, the Casterton School of 1856 presented before her own eyes a spectacle of health and comfort in the pupils, and a result of generous large-hearted benevolence in the founder, such as might well bring upon him, not calumny and vituperation, but blessings and gratitude? Such an avowal is indispensably required on Mrs. Gaskill's part, if she desires to relieve herself from the charge of conduct which I do not choose to characterise. Her own mind evidently has its misgivings as to the truth of the alleged facts even of the Cowen-bridge story.

Leeds Mercury - Tuesday 02 June 1857

CHARLOTTE BRONTE. TO THE EDITORS OF THE LEEDS MERCURY.

GENTLEMEN,— Will you kindly allow me to thank Mr. W. W. Carus Wilson for his last letter?

In his former statement all was perfection at Cowan Bridge; *now* we have the following points *admitted*:— That "during the spring of 1825 there prevailed a low fever, although not an alarming one" (what *would* alarm Mr. W. if the illness of about forty girls failed to produce that effect?); that "the doctor rather scornfully condemned" the girls' food; that "the servants thoughtlessly spoiled" it; that there were "privations;" that the schools were removed to a new situation—from. what cause Mr Wilson does not say.

But mark how easily Mr. Wilson disposes of any adverse testimony: "If there *are* any besides, perhaps a dismissed pupil or teacher."

Even at the risk of incurring such a summary dismissal, I cannot forbear giving him the following extract from a letter, which I have received from a former pupil at Cowan Bridge: merely premising that I fear it will tax even his ingenuity to rank the lady under either category:—

"On first reading 'Jane Eyre,' several years ago, I recognised immediately the picture there drawn, and was far from considering it in any way exaggerated: in fact, I thought at the time, and still think, the matter rather understated than otherwise. I suffered so severely from the treatment that, I was never in the school-room during the last three months I was there, until about a week before I left; and was considered to be far gone in a consumption. My mother (whose only child I was) was never informed of my illness, and I might certainly have died there without her being informed of it, had not a severe illness of her own caused her hastily to summon me home. She was so shocked at my appearance that she refused to allow me to return, though pressed to do so. It was some time before my constitution recovered the blow it then received. I attributed my illness to the unhealthy situation of the school, the long walks to church in bad weather (for in winter our feet were often wet during the whole of the service), and the scanty and ill-prepared food. The housekeeper was very dirty with the cooking—I have frequently seen grease swimming on the milk and water we had for breakfast, in consequence of its having been boiled in a greasy copper; and I perfectly remember having once been sent for a cup of tea for a teacher who was ill in bed, and no teaspoon being at hand, the housekeeper stirred it with her finger—she being engaged in cutting raw meat at the time. Our food was almost always badly cooked and besides that, we certainly had not enough of it, whatever may be said to the contrary. * * * In a word, the system at Cowan Bridge was a very harsh one, and I was very glad to hear that an improvement took place after the School was removed to Casterton, for it was much needed. I had no knowledge whatever of Mrs. Nicholls personally, and therefore my statement may fairly be considered an impartial one. You are quite welcome to make what use you think proper of this letter."

If Mr. Wilson's friends had confined themselves to a legitimate review of Mrs. Gaskell's work, I should never have written a line on this subject; but when they attacked the dead, and adopted the questionable course of disseminating their vile slander anonymously through the post-office (actually sending a copy to Mr. Brontë), I should, indeed, have been inexcusable if I had allowed their assertions to pass unchallenged .

Mr. W. W. Carus Wilson published a refutation, as he calls it; I have shown that it was nothing of the sort. To bandy further statements with him I have neither time nor inclination; besides, I am quite sure that both you and your readers would soon be as tired of us and our discussion as the poor girls were of their burnt porridge with "mixture as before."

Apologising for again trespassing on your valuable space,  
I am, Gentlemen, your obedient servant,  
A. B. NICHOLLS.  
Haworth Parsonage, May 29th, 1857.

Leeds Intelligencer - Saturday 06 June 1857

CHARLOTTE BRONTE. TO THE EDITOR OF THE INTELLIGENCER.

Sir,— I was aware that the reviewer had expressed the wish referred to by Mr. Wilson; and I now see that, while inserting all that was favourable to management at the school, he carefully omitted whatever was told against it.

Let me, however, thank Mr. W. W. Carus Wilson for his last letter. In his former communications to you all was perfection at Cowan Bridge, now have the following points *admitted*: —That during ...


ALSO:

P.S. Will Mr. W. W. Carus Wilson give the *maiden name* of the superintendent who "married the head of a college in America"? For, if she is, as I suspect, *most intimately* acquainted with the "Miss Scatcherd" of "Jane Eyre," there is a strong reason why she should wish to disparage the testimony of the avenging sister of "Helen Burns" (Maria Bronte), who was so cruelly treated by the *amiable* lady.


THE LETTER IS THEN DIRECTLY FOLLOWED BY THE ONE FROM W. W. CARUS WILSON THAT APPEARS IN Leeds Mercury - Thursday 28 May 1857.

THEN FOLLOWS:

A long letter, in defence of the Clergy Daughters' School and Mr. Carus Wilson, from the allegations made by C. Bronte, and repeated by Mrs. Gaskill, appeared in *The Times* on Wednesday. It was signed H. Shepheard, M. A., late Fellow and Tutor of Oriel College, Oxford, incumbent of Casterton, and Chaplain and Secretary of the Clergy Daughters' School, and dated Casterton, May 25. It concluded as follows:—

In plain English, Charlotte Bronte's own account of Cowanbridge is not to be trusted: and, indeed, how should it be so? She wrote, after the lapse of 20 years, of what came under her notice at eight or nine years of age, and, besides the misty dimness of recollections so distant, who does not know the microscopic effect upon the mind of a child, by which molehills are magnified into mountains, men into giants, and trifles into serious troubles?

And yet, Sir, upon such dreamy recollections and self-condemned fictions Charlotte Bronte's biographer has ventured to hold up to public execration an admirable institution, and to vilify a great and good man, whose whole life, now verging towards three score years and ten, has been one continuous refutation of such slanders, the single-minded and self-denying devotedness, remarkable even in these days of active benevolence, with which he has lived for one sole object—the good of his fellow-creatures!

The Clergy Daughters' School is a public institution, open to public inspection; and all who desire to know the truth are invited, as the best possible test, to visit the school itself; the horrors of starvation will be pleasantly dissipated by a burst of merriment from 100 round and rosy-cheeked girls, and their better feelings, I trust, raised in thankfulness to Him "from whom all good counsels and all just works do proceed," while they gaze upon the fruits of Mr. Carus Wilson's faithful labours, and bear the love and veneration felt for one whose name will be remembered with gratitude by children's children, long alter his calumniators are forgotten.

As regards the fever which broke out in the school, I have evidence that it existed in the village at the same time, and may, therefore, very probably have been communicated to the school by infection; at any rate, the fact destroys Mrs. Gaskell's assumption that it was caused by the bad food of the institution. And the same witness, an inmate of the school during the fever, and one who remembers the little Brontes there, can testify that, so far from the fever being "aggravated by the cruelty" of the managers, every possible care was taken of the invalids; wine and everything else recommended by the medical attendant, were liberally supplied, and not one child was attacked who did not recover. The only "cruelty" connected with the event is the cruelty of imputing unfeeling conduct to those who were doing their best to alleviate a Providential visitation, and who were spending and being spent in a great and benevolent and arduous undertaking for the good of others.

It will not do, sir, for bookmakers to seize upon the characters of public institutions or private persons as so much literary capital "To point a moral adorn a tale." The claim of character to be respected is a sacred right; and the disregard of it (to use your own forcible words) is "a species of criminality which is shamefully neglected in the statutes of the realm." Mr. Carus Wilson, indeed, can well afford smile of pity for his assailants, and will, I am sure, desire no other revenge upon them than to return them good for evil and blessing for railing. It would occupy too much of your space to answer all Mrs. Gaskell's opprobrious remarks in detail, though I have the means of disproving, point by point, more than one of her alleged facts; but I will conclude these observations with an extract from a letter lately received from a former pupil of Cowan-bridge, as a testimony to the general character both of Mr. Wilson and the school:—

On leaving school I was questioned on the subject by friends, one of whom has lately said that my testimony at that time was, what it is now, that the bread, milk, meat, vegetables, &c., were of the best quality, and that we always had as much as we wished for.' While at school I do not think I ever heard any complaints about the diet among the girls. I must say that nothing could exceed the care and kindness which watched over us; the wants of each individual child were attended to; the slightest ailment or indisposition was brought under the particular notice of the superintendent, and was sure to receive every attention. While I was at Cowan-bridge no sick child could have been treated as Maria Bronte is said to have been by a teacher, &c. They (the teachers) were, as a body, animated by a high sense of responsibility, joined to a feeling of affectionate interest in the girls, generally speaking.

"I cannot express the indignation with which I have read the character of Mr. Wilson, described by Mrs. Gaskell. It is very plain that she never knew him, or she never could have spoken of him in such terms. ... Oh, no; I never saw in Mr. Wilson 'spiritual pride,'' love of power,' or 'want of tenderness' in his treatment of us. He never wounded our feelings by any illusion to our dependent position; this is altogether a false representation of his conduct towards us. ... It would be a great comfort to me if I could anything to clear the school and its generous founder of the calumnies published against them by one who never knew either."

The writer of this letter allows me to publish her name if necessary. She is one whose name would add weight to her testimony, and whose worth would be attested by high and noble witnesses. I could add abundance more of extracts, did space permit; but I hope enough has been said to throw light upon the real nature of the case. The public will their opinion both of Mr. Wilson and his assailants.

Westmorland Gazette - Saturday 30 May 1857

"JANE EYRE" AND "CHARLOTTE BRONTE"

To the Editor of the Westmorland Gazette.

Sr,— Prominent notice has been taken recently by the press of the "Life of Charlotte Bronte," authoress of "Jane Eyre," and the charges brought against the Cowan Bridge School, and its founder the Rev. Wm. Carus Wilson, have been in some instances adopted and commented upon is if they were true.

I trust that a love of justice will engage you to give publicity to the following remarks on the other side.

I am willing to hope that neither Charlotte Bronte herself, nor her biographer, had any intention of injuring either the Clergy Daughters School or Mr. Carus Wilson. It is indeed, difficult to believe that these writers could be guilty of so wanton an attack upon public benevolence and private character. But the injury is not less real because it is undesigned. And it is only bare justice to this excellent institution and its benevolent founder that the false impressions created by these books should be counteracted by a contradiction as widely disseminated, if possible, as the calumnies themselves.

The charges made against Mr. Carus Wilson and the school either directly and by name, or by implication with the "Lowood" establishment in "Jane Eyre," are chiefly these — That the pupils were half-starved, the food provided for them being bad and insufficient — that they were treated with habitual neglect and want of feeling — that the low fever which broke out among them caused principally by the bad food, and aggravated by the cruelty of those at the head of the establishment — that the two elder sisters of Charlotte Bronte sunk under this treatment, and that Charlotte Bronte herself suffered her whole life long in health from it – that Mr. Carus Wilson's character was deformed by "spiritual pride," "want of tenderness," and long list of other unsightly excrescences.

Now, Sir, in answer to all this, I am prepared to produce good evidence and proof, that in the whole mass of the foregoing charges *there is not one word of truth*. I am compelled by the force of testimony now in my possession to believe that the promulgator of such falsehoods has received her information from those who were either ignorant of the real facts, or *disposed*, from wrong motives, to distort and misrepresent them. The testimony I have myself been able to collect, respecting events which happened more than thirty years ago, is furnished by those who were inmates of the establishment before, during, and after, the residence of the little Brontes within its walls.

The account given by Charlotte Bronte's biographer of the School and Mr. Carus Wilson is full of inaccuracies as to minor details of fact — not of much moment in themselves, but sufficient to show that her sources of information were not to be relied on. Whether the little Brontes were fit subjects for a school education is a different question altogether. The two younger children, Charlotte and Emily, "enjoyed uniformly good health" at Cowan Bridge. But Maria and Elizabeth, the former of whom is represented as the principal victim of the Cowan Bridge cruelties, in the character of "Helen Burns," were clearly not in a fit state of health to be sent to any school at all. They "were not strong enough when they came, having only just recovered from a complication of measles and hooping-cough; indeed I suspect they had scarcely recovered," &c. These are Mrs. Gaskell's own words; and she informs us moreover, that their mother died of internal cancer. These two children died of consumption inherent in a diseased constitution; and who can wonder at such a result, with such a constitution, after reading Mrs. Gaskell's own description of the *potato diet* of their own home — "the *cold damp arising from the fag floors and passages*" of Haworth Parsonage — the bleak moors, long winters, and bitter blasts of the rude climate, where, "often, on autumnal or winter nights, the four winds of heaven seemed to meet and rage together, tearing round the house as they were wild beasts striving find an entrance." Let any reasonable man say whether Mrs. Gaskell has not herself here described disease and hardship enough in the comfortless and cheerless home of their infancy to account for the early death of these two poor children, without imputing blame to the Cowan Bridge authorities for neglect and cruelty.

The testimony of an eye witness that Charlotte and Emily "*enjoyed uniformly good health*" the school, is a sufficient refutation of Mrs Gaskell's statement that "Charlotte suffered her whole life long, in heart and body, from the consequences of what happened there."

It may, Sir, answer the purpose of novel writers and book makers to write pathetic descriptions of scenes of suffering, and pungent satires on personal character but if truth is disregarded, and charity forgotten, let them remember that "as a mad man casteth fire-brands, arrows, and death, so is the man that deceiveth his neighbour and saith, I not in sport?"

As regards the diet at Cowen Bridge, it would be too much to expect that either in a public institution or even a private family, there should never be an instance of food being burnt or badly cooked. But here again I have the testimony of an eye-witness that "in this respect the institution in question compares very favorably with other and more expensive schools."

But, Sir, there is another aspect of the affair. It is not only the actors and interests of thirty years ago that are touched by Mrs. Gaskell's book.

The institution begun at Cowan Bridge has been carried on since 1833 at Casterton; and (to borrow the words of a Preston paper) "the vile attack made on the rev. gentleman (Mr. Carus Wilson) has reference to the Clergy Daughters' Schools, and in consequence of what is said on the subject in the Bronte memoirs, some ignorant reviewers of the public press in London have arrived at the conclusion that at Cowan Bridge, or Casterton, "there exists," as observes the Editor of the *Lancaster Gazette*, "a sort of Dotheboys' Hall. In this neighbourhood, the interesting establishments alluded to are well known, and we can only smile at the verdancy of our London contemporaries," &c. Now, Sir, in the Visitors' Book of the Casterton School there appears the name of "Mrs. Gaskell," as having visited the institution in March, 1856. She was shewn over the whole house, saw the pupils, and expressed nothing but satisfaction. Would it not have been, then, an act of bare justice, as well as an ingenuous and graceful acknowledgment, on her part, to have inserted in her memoir a frank avowal, that whatever may have been the merits or demerits of the Cowan Bridge School of 1824, the Casterton School of 1856 presented before her own eyes a spectacle of health and comfort in the pupils, and a result of generous large hearted benevolence in the founder, such as might well bring upon him not calumny and vituperation, but blessings and gratitude? Such an avowal is indispensably required on Mrs. Gaskell's part, if she desires to relieve herself from the charge of conduct which I not choose to characterize.

Her own mind evidently has its misgivings as to the truth of the alleged facts, even, of the Cowan Bridge story. She in effect admits that Charlotte Bronte's own recollection of the facts was indistinct; falsified and exaggerated by her own vivid imagination. Let any candid person read the following extract from the Bronte memoir, and say whether it does not virtually surrender Mrs. Gaskell's whole case. "I believe she herself (Charlotte) Bronte) would have been glad of an opportunity to *correct* the overstrong impression which was made upon the public by her vivid picture, though even she, suffering her whole life long, both in heart and body, from the consequences of what happened there, might have been apt, to the last, *to take her deep belief in facts for the facts themselves — her conception of truth for the absolute truth*," (p. 64).

In plain English, *Charlotte Bronte's own account of Cowan Bridge is not to be trusted!* And indeed how should it be so? She wrote, after the lapse of twenty years, of what came under her notice at eight or nine years of age, and besides the misty dimness of recollections so distant, who does not know the microscopic effect upon the mind of a child, by which mole-hills are magnified into mountains, men into giants, and trifles into serious troubles ?

And yet, Sir, upon such dreamy recollections and self-condemned fictions, Charlotte Bronte's biographer has ventured to hold up to public execration an admirable institution; and to vilify a great and good man, whose whole life, now verging towards three-score years and ten, has been one continuous refutation of such slanders, by the single-minded and self-denying devotedness, remarkable even in these days of active benevolence, with which he has lived for one sole object, the good of his fellow creatures!

The Clergy Daughters' School is a public institution, open to public inspection; and all who desire to know the truth are invited, as the best possible test, to visit the school itself; their horrors of starvation will be pleasantly dissipated by a burst of merriment from a hundred round and rosy cheeked girls, and their better feelings, I trust, raised in thankfulness to Him "from whom all good counsels and all just works do proceed," while they gaze upon the fruits of Mr. Carus Wilson's faithful labours, and hear of the love and veneration felt for one whose name will be remembered with gratitude by children's children, long after his calumniators are forgotten.

As regards the fever which broke out in the school, I have evidence that it existed in the village at the same time; it may therefore very probably have been communicated to the school by infection; at any rate, the fact destroys Mrs. Gaskell's assumption that it was caused by the bad food of the institution.

The only "cruelty" connected with the event is the cruelty of imputing unfeeling conduct those who were doing their best to alleviate a prudential visitation, and who were spending and being in a great and benevolent and arduous undertaking for the good of others.

It will not do, Sir, for bookmakers to Seize upon the characters of public institutions or private persons as so, much literary capital —  
"To point a moral, or adorn a tale."  

The claim of character be respected is a sacred right; and the disregard of it (to use the forcible words of the *Times* on another point) is "a species of criminality which is shamefully neglected in the statutes of the realm." Mr. Carus Wilson, indeed, can well afford a smile of pity for his assailants; and will, I am sure, desire no other revenge upon them than to return them good for evil and blessing for railing. It would occupy too much of your space to answer all Mrs. Gaskell's opprobrious remarks in detail; though I have the means of disproving, point by point, more than one of her alleged facts; but I will conclude these observations with an extract from a letter lately received from a former of Cowan Bridge, as a testimony to the general character both of Mr. Wilson and the school:

"JANE EYRE" AND THE CASTERTON SCHOOLS.

Many of our readers will be aware of the controversy which has been carried on in the metropolitan and other journals, with reference to the charges brought against The Clergy Daughters' School, founded by Mr. Carus Wilson, and formerly located at Cowen Bridge, but latterly at Casterton. These charges appeared in that striking novel "Jane Eyre," and although a fictitious name was adopted, it was soon pretty well known that the Casterton school was prefigured in the Lowood establishment, and in the experience of the heroine of the book. Miss Charlotte Bronte, the talented authoress, was believed to record her own reminiscences of residence in that institution. No notice, however, was taken by Mr. Carus Wilson of these imputations at the time, but there has lately appeared a memoir of the authoress, by Mrs. Gaskell, of Manchester, in which the charges were re-produced, and the establishment and founder localised. Mr. W. Wilson then came forward to refute the calumnies which had been cast upon the institution established by his father, and the Rev. Mr. Nicholl, who married Miss Bronte subsequent to the publication of "Jane Eyre," has replied in vindication of the authenticity his late wife's statements.

Another champion has now entered on the field, in the person of the Rev. H. Shepherd, M.A., incumbent of Casterton, and chaplain and secretary of the Clergy Daughters' School, who has addressed a letter to the *Times*, which had "adopted and commented upon the charges brought against the Cowen Bridge School and its founder, as if they were true."—From this letter we subjoin the following extracts:—

I am willing to hope that neither Charlotte Bronte herself nor her biographer had any intention of injuring either the Clergy Daughters' School or Mr. Carus Wilson. `[A substantial extract follows.]`

Lancaster Guardian - Saturday 06 June 1857

THE CASTERTON SCHOOL CONTROVERSY.

This paper warfare is still continued, though the subject is pretty nigh exhausted. The last two letters which have appeared are by Mr. Nicholls, in reply to Mr. W.W. Carus Wilson and Mr. Shepheard, incumbent of Casterton.

Mr. Nicholls, in a letter to the editor of the *Manchester Guardian*, says:—

"Will you kindly allow me to thank Mr. W. W. Carus Wilson for his last letter? We have now got the following admissions:— That 'in 183S there prevailed at Cowan Bridge low fever, not an alarming one' (I should like to know what would alarm Mr. Wilson, if the illness of about forty girls failed to produce that effect); that 'the doctor rather scornfully' condemned the food; that 'the servants thoughtlessly spoiled' it; and that 'the schools were removed to Casterton,' from what cause Mr. Wilson does not say.

"But mark how easily Mr. W. W. Carus Wilson disposes of witnesses:—'If there are any besides, perhaps a dismissed pupil or teacher.' Even at the risk of incurring such a summary dismissal, I cannot forbear giving him the following extract from a letter which I have received from a former pupil at Cowan Bridge:—

"'On first reading 'Jane Eyre,' several years ago, I recognised immediately the picture then drawn, and was far from considering it in any way exaggerated; in fact I thought at the time, and still think, the matter rather understated than otherwise. I suffered so severely from the treatment, that I was never in the schoolroom daring the last three months I was there, until about a week before I left, and was considered to be far gone in consumption. My mother (whose only child I was) was never informed of my illness, and I might certainly have died there without her being informed of it, had not a severe illness of her own caused her hastily to summon me home. She was so much shocked at my appearance, that she refused to allow me to return, though pressed to so. I was some time before my constitution recovered the blow it then received. I attribute my illness to the unhealthy situation of the school, the long walks to church in bad weather, (for in winter our feet were often wet daring the whole of the service,) and the scanty and ill prepared food. * * * The housekeeper was very dirty. I have frequently seen grease swimming on the milk and water we had for breakfast, in consequence of its having been boiled in a greasy copper; and I perfectly remember having once been sent for a cup of tea for teacher, who was ill in bed, and no teaspoon being to hand, the housekeeper stirred it with her finger, she being engaged in cutting raw meat at the time. I could give you scores of such instances as these, which fell under my own observation. Our food was almost always badly cooked, and besides that we certainly had not enough of it, whatever may be said to the contrary. * * * In a word the system at Cowan Bridge was a very harsh one, and I was very glad to hear that an improvement took place after the school was removed to Casterton, for it was much needed. I had no knowledge whatever of Mrs. Nicholls personally, and therefore my statement may fairly be considered an impartial one. You are quite welcome to make what use you think proper of this letter.'

"If Mr. Wilson's friends had confined themselves to legitimate review of Mrs. Gaskell's work, I should never have written a single line on this subject; but when they attacked the dead, and adopted the questionable course of disseminating their vile slander anonymously through the post-office (actually sending a copy to Mr. Bronte), I should indeed have been inexcusable if I had allowed their assertions to pass unchallenged.

"Mr. W. W. Carus Wilson publishes a refutation, as he calls it. I have shown that was nothing of the sort. To bandy farther statements with him I have neither time nor inclination; besides I am quite sore that both yon and your readers would soon be as tired of us and our discussion as the poor girls were of their burnt porridge, with "mixture as before."—Apologising for again trespassing on your valuable space, I am, sir, your obedient servant, A. B. Nicholls."

Mr. Shepheard is of course heard on the other side, in reply to a former letter by Mr. Nicholls. He says:—

"There appears to be altogether a mistake in Mr. Nicholls' mind to the reason of the Clergy Daughters' School being removed to Casterton. He speaks of "the fever that scourged the school, and the consequent change of site, and reformation of the establishment." This is total misconception, as will appear at once from a comparison dates. The fever broke out in 1825; the school was removed to Casterton in 1833 — eight years afterwards. The mere fact speaks for itself that the change of site had nothing do with the fever. This assumption is perfectly groundless as is the other, that it was for the purpose of reforming the establishment. There were obvious reasons, quite independent of the management of the school or the healthiness of the site, why it should be removed (as the Servants' School was likewise) to the spot where Mr. Carus Wilson was himself the resident minister. I have medical testimony that the situation of Cowan Bridge is not unhealthy, but well adapted for a public institution, lying on a high level, with good fall for drainage, and free from fogs and mists. It is also an incorrect statement that 40 girls were attacked by the fever. The number was 30, end they all recovered. The little Brontes escaped the infection entirely. The fever was of mild character; a circumstance which, I believe, every medical man would consider as a decided proof that the situation could not be unhealthy. For, in unhealthy situations, fevers which might otherwise be mild, are pretty sure to take on a malignant character.

"It is one of the worst features in the whole affair, that some exceptional instances of mismanagement in the subordinates at the first establishment of the school, which may really have happened, are made by tacit inference to mark its general character, and that through its whole course.

"In a recent letter to the public journals I have admitted that there may have been instances of burnt or badly cooked food; and I have since received confirmation, from new sources, of the correctness of that admission. A correspondent writes to me:— "I fear that there must have been some grounds of complaint against the conduct of the cook, when first the school opened. It could not be expected that a new institution should be perfect in all its parts; and it is vary shocking to one's feelings that circumstances which caused Mr. Wilson so much sorrow and anxiety should be attributed to his indifference and neglect with bitter reproach."

"Just so, sir; and Mrs. Gaskell herself, to do her justice, exonerates Mr. Wilson of the charge of indifference and neglect, and rightly lays the blame on the right person—the cook; and this cook was dismissed in a few months.

"The same remark applies to the statements of harsh treatment of the pupils by a teacher. I have not been able to meet with any confirmation of these accounts; and certainly they ought to be either retracted, or authenticated producing the name of the teacher, or at least the names of eye-witnesses. But even supposing, for argument's sake, the story of 'Helen Burns's' ill-treatment to be true, it is a gross injustice and inexcusable calumny to represent the whole Cowan Bridge institution generally characterised by a spirit of harsh and hateful tyranny, on account of the conduct of one teacher at one time. There is also an implied falsehood in representing Maria Bronte under the name of Helen Burns, as having died at the school at all—for she died at her own home, and it is a still further step in calumniating, to represent these things as in any way sanctioned or tolerated by Mr. Carus Wilson, as 'Jane Eyre' unquestionably does. Would Mrs. Gaskell, or did Charlotte Bronte, venture to assert, that Mr. Carus Wilson would permit a child to be treated as Helen Burns is represented to have been? or that he would have retained in the school any teacher who had been guilty of such injustice and cruelty? If not Mrs. Gaskell is bound, in common justice, to clear him of such odious imputations. * * * *

"While on the subject, let me point out another gross misrepresentation, Mrs. Carus Wilson and her two daughters are professedly described in "Jane Eyre" as presenting, in their fashionable dress and appearance, a revolting contrast to the plainness enforced by their husband and father's lectures in the schoolroom. It is a sufficient refutation of this disgraceful insinuation to state, that at the time C. Bronte was at Cowan Bridge, Mr. Carus Wilson's eldest daughters were scarcely out of the nursery—not girls of 16 or 17—and could not, therefore, have furnished the originals of the two Misses Brocklehurst in "Jane Eyre."

"From this one specimen of C. Bronte truthfulness, let the candid public judge of the value of her other caricatures of Cowan Bridge and its conductors.

* * * * *

"Mr.Nicholls is mistaken in supposing that the lady who wrote to Mrs. Gaskell is the same who is referred to by Mr. W. W. Carus Wilson. In short, the attacks made against the school, and Mr. Carus Wilson, both by C. Bronte and Mrs. Gaskell, are so full of misrepresentations and ignorant mistakes matters of fact, as to forfeit for the writers all reasonable claim to credit. Those who were either so ill informed, or ill disposed, deserve not even the indulgence accorded to involuntary error; for certainly they were in duty bound, before they undertook even the exposure of alleged facts by which any person's character feelings might be wounded, to use the most scrupulous care in ascertaining, and fidelity in narrating them.

"I repeat, that these sweeping charges of habitual neglect, mismanagement, and harshness at the Cowan Bridge School, are wholly unsupported by fact and unworthy of credit. And as to the personal invectives in the 'Life,' against Mr. Carus Wilson himself, there is not even a single fact so much as specified in support of them. They are a tissue of falsehoods against a man wholly unknown to the calumniator.

"Instead of falsely accusing a good man, the charity which 'covereth a multitude of sins' might have suggested that it would be more Christian to pass over in silence even real inconsistencies, had they occurred, a reflection not perhaps unsuitable for one who has used such extraordinary freedom in criticising the Christian character of others, as Mrs. Gaskell has done in the 'Life of Charlotte Bronte."—I am, sir, yours truly,

CHARLOTTE BRONTE.

TO THE EDITOR OF THE INTELLIGENCER.

Sir,—The lady who signs herself "A Lover of Truth" in the letter referring to the Cowen Bridge School has, I think, mistaken the purport of the refutation in your paper from the Rev. H. Shepheard and Mr. W. Carus Wilson. If Mrs. Gaskill had simply stated in her "Life" that for two or three weeks there was once a cook at Cowen Bridge who occasionally spoiled porridge, and that she was very soon dismissed, instead of giving the public the impression that the pupils were "half starved," "cruelly treated," and Mr. Carus Wilson "proud" and "unfeeling," "inconsistent," &c., there would have been no need for any defence. In common with other warmly attached pupils I can bear testimony to the *practical* kindness of Mr. Wilson's conduct, and to the kindness of the teachers as well as to the comfort and happiness all experienced there.—Yours truly,  
A Cowen Bridge Pupil in the early Years of the School.  
P.S.—I enclose my card, with full name and address.

[We hope that this letter will close all correspondence the subject.—Editor.]

CHARLOTTE BRONTE AND SILVERDALE (FROM A CORRESPONDENT.)

In one of the local guides to Silverdale we are informed that "Charlotte Bronte was educated at Casterton, not very far away, and when fever broke out she was sent to 'The Cove,' where an apartment is still known as 'The Bronte Room.' "This statement contains one glaring inaccuracy, for Charlotte Bronte was not educated at Casterton The Clergy Daughters' School now at Casterton, was in her day at Cowan Bridge, and she left before its locality was changed. Readers of "Jane Eyre" can never forget her pictures of the life at Cowan Bridge school, and her presentation its founder, the Rev. William Carus Wilson as Mr. Brocklehurst. One of Wilson's houses was that now known as Cove House. Silverdale, but it does not seem at all likely that Charlotte would be invited there as a guest, and none of her biographers allude to any temporary removal from Cowan Bridge. Yet the tradition is very persistent, and there is certainly a "Bronte Room" in The Cove, and it is in the older part of the house. Mr. Wilson built the former church at Silverdale in 1829, and the present vicarage in 1837. In 1893 there was resident in Silverdale a lady of 80, who had been a teacher at Casterton, and did not think the imaginary Brocklehurst was too severe a picture of the real Carus Wilson. This lady mentioned the stay of Charlotte Bronte at The Cove as a matter within her knowledge, although it had happened before her connection with the school. It is, of course, possible that when the fever broke out at Cowan Bridge some of the children who had not been attacked were taken to The Cove as a place of safety. Charlotte cannot have been removed there for convalescence, none of the Brontes had the fever. Such is Mrs. Gaskell's explicit statement.

Having been recently in Silverdale, I have tried to ascertain the foundation for the local tradition. The result is not entirely satisfactory, as direct evidence, yet it is not easy to disbelieve it entirely.

Certainly one would like think that at lovely Silverdale, with its wealth of woods, and its sea breezes, Charlotte Bronte may have found some compensation for the discomforts, physical and moral, of her dreary school days at Cowan Bridge.

Hampshire Telegraph - Friday 04 September 1959

Portsmouth Link With The Brontes

PORTSMOUTH has many literary associations. Charles Dickens was born here. Conan Doyle practised as a doctor here. H. G. Wells gained his draper's apprentice experience for "Kipps" from Southsea. So it seems almost inevitable that Portsmouth should have a link, however tenuous and unhappy, with Charlotte Bronte.

Having lived in Scarborough, with its funereal associations with Anne Sulfite, it was, for me. an exciting discovery to make when I learned I was stall living in a place which could claim some faint, indirect association with that literary family for which I have unbounded admiration.

The discovery was made when I was passed for review a monogram entitled "The Life and Works of William Carus Wilson, 1791 - 1859," by Jane Ewbank. True, the association of the Rev. William Carus Wilson with the young Charlotte Bronte was a most unfortunate one, for this reverend gentleman was the origin of Mr. Brocklehurst. Principal of that dreadful school in "Jane Eyre." Charlotte Bronte described him In unflattering terms: Mr. Brocklehurst is not a god, nor is he even a great and admired man; he is little liked here; ha never took steps to make himself liked."

The school of Jane Eyre was based on Cowan Bridge School, the Clergy Daughters' School on the turnpike road between Leeds and Kendal, attended by Charlotte and three of her sisters, Maria, Elizabeth, and Emily. Maria died front consumption, and Charlotte attributed this to the conditions at their school.

Later the school was moved from Cowan Bridge to a healthier site, Kirkby Lonsdale. As Casterton School, it still flourishes. Jane Ewbank, a pupil at the school, has written a monograph to mark the centenary of the death of the founder William Carus Wilson.

Roger Fulford has written foreword to the little book, and he says, truly: "We must applaud the courage of anyone attempting to give us a biographical sketch of Mr. Carus Wilson — the 19th Century philanthropist and founder of the Clergy Daughters' School... we can all recognize the poetic justice which enables a pupil at the school to challenge the verdict of the most illustrious of its old girls with this monograph.

"Not everyone may agree with everything which Jane Ewbank has written ... but I feel sure that everyone reading this short biography will share my admiration for the youthful talent so delightfully and conspicuously displayed."

PORTSMOUTH...
  
Where does Portsmouth come into all this?

Mr. Carus Wilson retired to live at Ventnor, and during this time he became well-known in Portsmouth, where he did good work for the soldiers who were, at that time, embarking for India. He provided the first Soldiers' Institute and became known in Portsmouth as "the soldiers' friend." So the man Charlotte Bronte loathed at Cowan Bridge later became well beloved in Portsmouth.

The fashion for debunking the figures of the past seems to have died, and Mrs. Ewbank's book is in the newer tradition of tolerant reassessment. She points out, justly, that, when considering the Rev. Carus Wilson, we must remember that we live in a different age, which upholds other ideas and beliefs. "We must not be tempted to Judge him by modern standards but by those of his day."

It is refreshing to find a young person those days who is able to take such a balanced view; but such a statement also shows that Charlotte Bronte, like many thinkers and writers of genius, was in advance of her time.

The puritans of the world, taken as a whole, have done as much harm as the reprobates. The Rev. Carus Wilson was not only a puritan, but one who was anxious to save the souls of his young charges from hell and damnation. His theology was the basis of his actions. A glance at the prospectus of his school shows the influence of his theological views and puritan outlook. The education offered was liberal, but not the doctrinal teaching. Sinisterly, in modern eyes, reads the pronouncement "No vacations allowed" and the teaching post described as "Scourge Mistress."

MORE AGREEABLE

Yet a more agreeable light falls upon Mr. Carus Wilson when we read of his work in Portsmouth. He wrote a tract with a strangely prophetic title, "Portsmouth in Flames," in which he vigorously attacked the sins of "drunkenness, debauchery and ungodliness" among soldiers.

One of the largest brewers in Portsmouth was "convinced of the sin which the sale of his beer caused and decided to abandon his prosperous business altogether," writes Miss Ewbank. The police reported that there was a "visible decrease in the amount of drunkenness and disorder." Many of us, by no means teetotal fanatics, could wish for a Carus Wilson today.

The great Lord Shaftesbury  praised his work in Portsmouth. Week after week Mr. Wilson came over from Ventnor to Portsmouth to preach to the soldiers despite bad weather and ill-health; he was in continual pain.

In St John's Church, Newport, Isle of Wight, is a fine, white  marble monument, sculptured by R. Westmacott. R.A., erected to the memory of the Rev. Carus Wilson, by "The Non-Commissioned Officers and  Privates of the British Army in token of their love and gratitude."

"THAT GOOD MAN"

But even more striking are the simple words of a native African soldier on his deathbed: "Oh! massa, if God takes me Home, me will see that good man, Massa Carus Wilson..."

Though this reverend gentleman's theology was harsh, and though he employed a bad cook at Charlotte Bronte's old school (the main cause of the trouble there, it seems), and though he employed a "Scourge Mistress," at the end there were those who remembered him with gratitude.

"The Life and Works of Carus Wilson" is published at Kendal by Titus Wilson and Son, Ltd. The price is not given. C.H.G.
