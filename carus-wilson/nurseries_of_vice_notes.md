# Nurseries of Vice

The context for this is a reference I happened across to a pamphlet entitled "Tempters and Tempted" which appears to have ranted against Newport as a hotbed of vice corrupting the soldiers barracked at Parkhurst. A later pamphlet also became the subject of a libel case against local dignitary, F. Pittis.

I still haven't managed to track down either pamphlet...

Many of the same names and drinking establishments appear regularly in the court reports (I have not included all reports, so the sample below is skewed) which suggests a possible cast of characters and locations for some sort of telling...

Context: Crimean War, October 1853 – March 1856; troops start going out Spring/Summer 1854

Hampshire Independent - Saturday 01 July 1848

IMPORTANT VESTRY MEETING.

A Vestry was held in St. Thomas's Church on Thursday last, in pursuance of a requisition signed by a very respectable number of parishioners to the Churchwardens, requesting them to call a meeting of the inhabitants, to consider the propriety of rebuilding St. Thomas's Church by voluntary subscriptions.

The Senior Warden, Mr. S. PRING, having stated the object of the meeting,

Robert B. SEWELL, Esq., rose and said that he had been requested to bring the subject of the meeting before the Vestry, to state the particular purpose for which the meeting had been called, and he did it with peculiar pleasure, seeing such a number of the requisitionists present with him at the meeting. He (Mr. S.) would not detain them by any lengthened observations; but in order that they might understand their position, he would bring to their minds the remembrance of a vestry which was held about a twelvemonth since. That vestry was called to consider the best means of placing the Church in efficient repair, and a Committee was appointed for the purpose of obtaining a proper survey of the Church, by virtue of the first resolution, which was to the effect that the state of the Church was such as to call for immediate restoration and improvement. The Committee proceeded to obtain surveys and procure plans for its restoration, to be submitted to a future vestry. In the mean time it was wished to ascertain what sums of money could be procured for the purpose of putting it in a proper state of restoration, within a certain period of years. Anxious to obtain an opinion, however, as to the real stability of the fabric—an able, complete, and disintereeted opinion, and not open to attacks or observations—application was made in the first place to Mr. Cubitt; he was not, however, able to give a perfectly satisfactory opinion, as he was not able to give his personal attention to the subject. The Committee then appealed to Mr. Hardwicke, a surveyor of exceeding eminence in London, and one of the first of the profession. He had, with his son, surveyed the Church, and had given a written opinion—the opinion which led to the calling of the present vestry. The report, which was of considerable length, stated that the building, which was erected in the thirteenth century, had undergone considerable alterations at the commencement of the eighteenth century; that they had examined the walls, and found them decayed and dilapidated to some considerable extent; the naves, piers, and arches in very bad condition; that the whole structure had suffered much from badly considered alterations; that the seats were badly arranged, the roofs sunk, and in bad condition; that the timbers, however, were not unsound excepting the beams; that the tower was solid and substantial, provided the decaying stones were replaced by sounder material, but that the parapet and pinnacles were dangerous and unsound, and where not already removed ought to be so at once; that the edifice altogether was not actually dangerous to the congregation, but that it was in that state of decay that they could not advise any sum to be laid out upon it, in an attempt to repair it, for in that case it would be difficult to know where to stop, but in the event of the church being rebuilt, it would not be necessary to pull down the tower, but only to restore it. The Committee, on receiving this report, felt themselves unauthorised in taking farther proceedings until they had caused a vestry to be summoned to consider their position. This vestry was held in August last year, and the gentlemen then present, feeling that the matter should not and ought not rest there, and with the opinion of Mr. Hardwicke also before them, feeling that it was not right for the church to remain in that position until the danger did arise, they considered it best to start some plan for the purpose of considering the best mode of proceeding with the ulterior object of rebuilding the church. Conferences on this subject had been had with the Archdeacon and with the Bishop of the Diocese, on the right course of proceeding, and it was with the sanction of these great and competent authorities that he now came before the vestry to ask them to sanction those views and enable the Committee to carry out the objects they originally proposed —namely: To raise a fund by degrees, and by gradual accumulations and donations and subscriptions, for the purpose of pulling down the present edifice entirely, and building a new church. In order to do that rightly to the parishioners and right for the house of God, this building should not be inefficiently erected, but rebuilt in such a way as should make it stand fur centuries, as the present edifice had done. They could say five years for subscriptions to accumulate, and not consent to the rebuilding unless a sufficient amount had been subscribed to enable them to go on with safety for that purpose. He now came before the Vestry for their sanction to these objects, that if a sufficient suns of money could be raised the parish would sanction their proceeding. If the vestry would that day sanction the rebuilding as soon as a sufficient sum could be raised, parties could then be placed in proper position for asking for the means of doing it, and the first object to be ascertained was the amount of costs, and then the amount to be collected sufficient to cover them. Mr. Hardwicke had stated that six thousand pounds would be sufficient; but they all knew the variations in estimates, and the after-calls that were frequently made upon them. Feeling that whatever was to be done should be substantially done, and what such a building demanded —feeling that a small sum uf money would be of no purpose whatever, and that any sum could be obtained if parties would exert themselves zealously to obtain it——he thought eight thousand pounds not too much to expend upon such a building, as he should feel sorry to see a single farthing expended, unless done substantially; and they had most of them seen of late years the very inefficient manner in which some churches had been erected. It was the duty of the churchwardens to see that no act of desecration was committed, until a satisfactory statement of the funds in hand to complete it had been furnished them, in order to discharge them from all responsibility in the matter; and he (Mr. S.) wished it to be distinctly understood that they ought not to consent to anything being done slightly or temporarily, or not even to be done at all, until they saw their way clearly through the matter. It was a most important question, and connected with the best interests of the town, and should be therefore considered most properly. If the vestry would now sanction the proposition to rebuild the church when sufficient funds be obtained for that purpose, they would at once give sufficient power to its well wishers to proceed at once to obtain that sum, and which he was sure would he obtained under their sanction. He felt assured that success would attend their efforts, if they set zealously and regularly and determinedly forward to obtain it, and it ought to be entered into under a deep sense of the nature of the work itself, and the purpose for which it was required, and for what purpose the money was to be appropriated. When once the subject was started, they would find many persons anxious to devote their pounds, nay, their hundreds of pounds, to the service of Almighty God; even that very day he would bring to their notice the consecration of the church of St. Augustine, in the county of Kent, where one individual contributed of his own means the sum of sixty thousand pounds towards its erection. Feeling it right that it should be done, and knowing that all could do something —feeling that if they gave to the extent of their means, not so much either as to the amount, but with a right spirit—he felt sure that their object would be obtained. There was a kind of feeling of depression over the town of Newport, which he feared had been created by their neglect of the house of God. Had they not allowed it to go on—if not into decay—without improvement, or caring for its welfare? and so long as they suffered things to go on in that careless manner, he feared that the blessing of God would never be shed over their doings or over their town. He trusted they would endeavour all in their power to raise sufficient sums to them to build a church sufficient for the town, and efficient in every respect for the service of the Almighty. Mr. Sewell concluded his very able and eloquent address by proposing that the Vestry should sanction the re-building of the church as soon as the necessary means should be provided.

Seconded by Mr. BENJAMIN Mew.

Mr. SAYER, as a Dissenter, wished to have a distinct understanding, that if the present church was pulled down the new one was to be built by the voluntary principle, and that parties were not afterwards to be called upon for a church-rate to pay for any particular portion of it.

Mr. BRYANT: The resolution says—" As soon as the necessary funds have been provided."

Mr. SAYER: A distinct understanding is all I want on the subject.

Mr. P. SCOTT: It is in the power of the parish to refuse its assent to the pulling down until the necessary funds are raised.

Mr. SEWELL: I hope Mr. Sayer does not advert to any church-rate in perspective which may attach itself to this church, because, if so, I cannot undertake to answer his question

Mr. SAYER: I only allude to the building.

Mr. SEWELL: I only ask the parish to assent to the pulling down and re-building, when they shall be completely satisfied that there are funds in hand sufficient for the purpose, and there shall be nothing done without the sanction of all the authorities, nor do we intend to call on the parish for a rate for that purpose.

Mr. SAYER expressed himself perfectly satisfied.

Mr. NICHOLSON enquired if the right of the parishioners to their different sittings would be reserved to them as at present.

Mr. SEWELL Certainly.

There being neither amendment nor opposition offered the proposition, the CHAIRMAN put tbs question to the meeting, and it was carried unanimously, not a single hand being held up against it in a crowded vestry.

Mr. B. Mew expressed himself highly gratified with the novel unanimity of the meeting, and proposed a vote of thanks to the Senior Warden. Mr. Pring, for his kindness.

Mr. PRING acknowledged the compliment, and wished "he might live to see the new church finished."

Borough Petty Sessions, Monday.— Present, C. W. Estcourt, Esq., Mayor, E. Way, and R. M. Wavell, Esqs.

Ann Tayler was charged with being drunk and disorderly at the Tontine Tap on Sunday night. She was turned out of the house, but returned, when she was given into custody. John Hollywood gave evidence that the defendant came his house and drank with the soldiers, using very bad language, which he was determined not to allow. The defendant said was owing to her having had a little drink; if the Court would forgive her, she would leave the Isle of Wight that day. The Mayor said it was not a very serious charge, and they would dismiss the case provided she would leave the Isle of Wight.

TOWN COUNCIL

A general meeting of the council was held  in the Council Chamber, at the Guildhall, on Tuesday last, for general business. The names of the members of the council being called over, the town clerk gave notice that the first business to be transacted was the

ELECTION OF A MAYOR.

Upon which Thomas Cooke, Esq., after passing very high compliment the late mayor for the conscientious fulfilment of his duties during the last year, and proposed Mr. Francis Pittis to fill that office for this borough for the ensuing year, and in doing so, bore testimony to his high character and ability, and although he was unwilling when first asked to be proposed fill the office, he had now consented; and he therefore felt great pleasure in proposing him.

Edward Way, Esq., said it is with great pleasure that he seconded the nomination of Mr. Francis Pittis, as the mayor of the Borough of Newport, as he is a native of the town and much respected, and one that he (Mr. Way) himself had been acquainted with for many years.

There being no opposition, Mr. Pittis was then sworn in, and the ex-mayor resigned his seat into his hands; which being properly occupied, the mayor, said, —the first step I consider for me to take in filling this chair, is to return you my sincere and heartful thanks for placing me here, and I very sensible of the honor conferred upon me in being placed in this position, and when I feel that it has been by the unanimous voice of this meeting, not one vote being accorded against me this day, it is most gratifying to me, and will help to carry through this important function which is the highest you could have placed upon me. I shall feel it my duty to dismiss everything like party or political feelings from my breast, and will endeavour so far as possible to do everything that may be conducive to the prosperity of the town of Newport. I hope therefore that you will give me that support which my office requires from you.

Hampshire Advertiser - Saturday 05 August 1854

NEWPORT, Saturday, August 5. St. Thomas's Church.— The foundation-stone of the new church is intended to be laid, on the 24th instant, by his Royal Highness Prince Albert. Invites have been sent to the Provincial Grand Master and the Masonic brethren, the authorities of the Island, the members, the Magistrates, Mayor and Corporation, the Bishop of Winchester, the Archdeacon of the Diocese, the Rural Dean, and the clergy of the Island, the officers of the Garrison, &c. and we imagine the sight will be the grandest that we shall have witnessed in the Island for years.

...

NEWPORT TOWN COUNCIL. [Tuesday, the Mayor, F. Pittis, esq. in the chair]

...

PRINCE ALBERT'S VISIT TO LAY THE FOUNDATION STONE.

The Chairman observed that as her Majesty's Royal Consort had most graciously condescended to visit their ancient town at the end of the month, for the purpose of laying the foundation stone of their new church, he thought it was proper that he should be received by the officials of the town in a becoming manner. He therefore begged to invite the Corporation to meet him on the auspicious occasion; and other arrangements were being made, with the view of giving the Prince a suitable reception. 

Mr. Pinnock. hoped that if any of the Council were absent on that day, it would not be construed into a want of loyalty for their Prince. Some of their body objected to processions, and wearing gowns; and he and others dissented from the doctrines of the Church of England. Therefore they could scarcely be expected to assist in laying the foundation atone of a church which denounces them some thirteen times a year.

The Mayor again observed he should be happy to see them all, and the subject dropped.

Hampshire Advertiser - Saturday 12 August 1854


NEWPORT, Saturday, August 12.

The Old Church is fast disappearing, and workmen are clearing the north-eastern side, for the purpose of arranging for the laying the foundation-stone— (see advertisement). We believe room will be allotted for nearly 2000 spectators, and everything is being done to render the anxiously looked-for day one of the most auspicious our town has ever witnessed. We can conscientiously say that there is but one feeling amongst all classes, that of unmixed desire to give the Prince a reception worthy of his high position and his exalted character. The banquet to be given by the committee will be on a scale of excellence and elegance; answers to the invitations have been nearly all received, and we have no doubt that this part of the matter will pass off with credit to all parties. We would recommend our friends to secure tickets as soon as possible, as there is even now a great demand for them. We have been given to understand that it is the gracious intention of her Majesty to erect a monument to the Princess Elizabeth, daughter of the unfortunate Charles I. Nothing can be more graceful than this act of our beloved Sovereign. There is a sympathy in it for the fate of one of royal blood, and another evidence of her Majesty's good wishes for our church and town. We gave some information respecting this unfortunate Princess a few weeks ago. The vault in which her remains lay was discovered in 1793, near the altar, when the church was undergoing some repairs; a stone with the initials "E. S." simply marking the spot. On the coffin appeared the following inscription :—

ELIZABETH 2ND DAUGHTER OF THE LATE KING CHARLES. DECE'D SEPT. 8. MDCL.
 
In order to more particularly mark the spot, the Church-wardens removed an old copper plate from the churchyard wall, which had been placed there in 1707, to the memory of a respected minister of their parish named Shergold, on the back of which they caused to be engraved the inscription to the illustrious Princess Elizabeth, which has already appeared in this paper, and was laid into a stone immediately in front of the altar. On removing this plate, within the last few days, the following quaint inscription to the clergyman was found at the back :—

HERE LYETH YE BODY OF MASTER GEORGE SHERGOLD LATE MINISTER OF NEWPORT WHO DURING SIXTEEN YEARS IN DISCHARGE OF HIS OFFICE STRICTLY OBSERVED YE TRUE DISCIPLINE OF YE CHURCH OF ENGLAND DISLIKING THAT DEAD BODIES SHOULD BE BURIED IN GODS HOUSE APPOINTED TO BE INTERRED IN THIS PLACE HE DYED UNIVERSALLY LAMENTED AND ESTEEMED JANUARY XXIII 1707.

From a MS. in the British Museum, entitled "Church Motes in the Isle of Wight," and bearing the date of March, 1719, we learn that this tablet was on the churchyard wall, and as it conveyed a rebuke on the practice which very generally prevailed at the close of the last century, of burying within the church, it was probably selected to supply the material for the inscription over the resting place of the Princess, when accidently opened in 1793.

ELSEWHERE IN SAME ISSUE (p5):

NEWPORT, ISLE OF WIGHT

NEWPORT, Saturday, August 26.

GRAND CEREMONY OF LAYING THE FOUNDATION STONE OF THE NEW CHURCH OF SAINT THOMAS'S, NEWPORT, ISLE OF WIGHT.

As we anticipated in our last, the inhabitants of Newport witnessed on Thursday the grandest and most important day that had ever been known in the ancient borough. The preceding evening was remarkably unfavourable; the wind blew quite a hurricane, and copious showers seemed to portend anything but a propitious Thursday. Nevertheless, the weather-glass "looked up," and hundreds awoke with thankful hearts on beholding a delightful sunny morning, which was rendered the more pleasant by the sprinkling over night.

The day was ushered in with a merry peal from the mellow bells of the old tower of St. Thomas, and the borough exhibited the appearance of a general holiday- the business of the town was almost entirely suspended, and flags and banners, with numerous devices, were to be seen pendant from the principal houses of the town. The approaches to the borough were variously decorated, and several beautiful arches, with appropriate devices, were erected in the principal thoroughfares. The "Albert Arch," decorated with the Prince's royal arms and other devices, was situated at the bottom of the High-street. The next arch was opposite the Town Hall, having the borough arms, and representing the Corporation of the borough of Newport. A third was in the Corn Market, and termed, "The Clerical Arch," with the Right Rev. The Lord Bishop of Winchester's arms; and a fourth, in the vicinity of the Bugle inn—a most splendid affair, called "the National Arch." There were other devices in the upper part of the town, the Beast and Corn Markets, Node-hill, &c. In every direction flags of every conceivable hue and colour met the eye, displayed from the most prominent situations, and scarcely a house of any size or importance but was profusely decorated with garlands of flowers bouquets, evergreens, and complimentary devices. In the main streets, garlands of flowers were suspended from side to side and the remains of the old church were also profusely decorated. Immense numbers of persons from all parts of the Island flocked in at an early hour, and, with bands of music and banners the whole scene presented a very grand and imposing effect.

At eleven o'clock, thousands of persons were assembled in the principal streets, and most of the shops immediately closed. Soon after, a guard of honour, consisting of about 200 troops of the Garrison, defiled in front of the Hall, and the Royal Marine Band struck up a pleasing strain.

The Members of the Town Council met at the residence of the Mayor, at half-past eleven o'clock, and accompanied him to the Town Hall.

The Bishop and about twenty of the Clergy assembled for the purpose of robing, at twelve o'clock, at the residence of the Rev. G H. Connor, and proceeded from thence in procession to the Town Hall.

The officers and brethren of the several Lodges assembled at the Masonic Hall at eleven o'clock, when a Grand Lodge of the province of the Isle of Wight was held, and a procession formed by twelve o'clock, which proceeded to the Guildhall, where the procession remained, to await the arrival of his Royal Highness Prince Albert.

Between twelve and one, the various bodies intended to form the procession were to be seen emerging from their different rendezvous, for the purpose of assembling in Quay-street.

At one o'clock, his Royal Highness Prince Albert arrived, and the Royal Marine band commenced playing the National Anthem. The illustrious Prince was received by the Worshipful the Mayor and the Lord Bishop of Winchester, who escorted him to the Hall. The procession soon after formed in the following order:—

Policemen.

The Rev. The Rural Dean. The Rev. G. H. Connor.  
Mayor's Chaplain.  
Assistant Curate of St. Thomas's, Newport.  
The Clergymen of the Island.  
Policemen.

The whole mass now moved forward towards the church, the Prince conversing with the Worshipful the Mayor and the Bishop. When the procession arrived at the tower of St. Thomas's Church, it halted, and divided right and left, for the Right Worshipful the Provincial Grand Master and the Provincial Grand Officers to pass up the centre, preceded by his banner and Sword Bearer, and followed by the remainder of the procession, until the whole had entered the enclosure around the stone.

Spacious galleries had been erected, and these were filled by the fashionables of the Island, with a good sprinkling of military and naval uniforms. The stone was suspended by a pulley from supports decorated with evergreens. It was very large, and beautifully chiselled for the occasion. We understand it was the gift of Mr. Joseph Poore, of Newport. It bore the following inscription, engraved on a brass plate: —"On Thursday, August 24th, A.D., 1854, this foundation stone was laid by his Royal Highness the Prince Albert, Francis Pittis, Mayor; George Henry Connor, M.A. Minister; Edward Way, Henry Loosemore, Church-wardens."

His Royal Highness, accompanied by the Mayor and Masonic officers, walked through the portal of the church tower, and the positions were taken up as follows :—

 Town Clerk, Equerries. The Bishop's Chaplain, James Eldridge, esq. Rev. E. M'All.  
The Mayor, F. Pittis, esq. His Royal Highness Prince Albert. The Lord Bishop of   Winchester.  
The Mayor's Chaplain, Rev. Mr. Wallis. THE STONE. The Rev. E. D. Scott, Vicar of Carisbrooke.  
Provincial Grand Master, T. W. Fleming, esq. The Rev. G. H. Connor.  
Deputy Provincial Grand Master. Architect, Mr Daukes. Minister of St. Thomas's Church.  
Senior Warden, Mr. E. Way. Junior Warden, Mr. Loosemore. Builders, Messrs. T. and J. Dashwood, of Ryde.  
Surrounded by the Corporation and the whole Clergy of the Island. The choir and band were allotted a portion of one of the galleries.

His Royal Highness viewed the brilliant assembly with evident interest while the stone was being raised. The Bishop of Winchester then said aloud, "The glorious Majesty of the Lord our God be upon us! Prosper Thou the work of our hands upon us! O, prosper Thou our handy work."

Psalm cxxxii., verses 3 to 16 inclusive, was then repeated alternately by the Bishop and Clergy and a large number of the spectators.

The architect of the building then presented to his Royal Highness the working plans of the church, and explained to him its proposed accommodation, after which a bottle, containing the coins of the realm and parchment roll, were deposited in a cavity beneath the stone. The foundation stone was then partly lowered, and a silver trowel presented to Prince Albert.

The trowel, provided by Mr. Dudley, silversmith, was of most chaste workmanship, and bore the following inscription :— "St Thomas's church, Newport, Isle of Wight. The foundation stone laid by his Royal Highness Prince Albert, August 24tb, 1854. Francis Pittis, Mayor." On the back were his Royal Highness's arms, surrounded by the Order of the Garter, very elaborately executed.

His Royal Highness then spread the cement on the lower stone, the upper stone was let down slowly, with solemn music, and his Royal Highness said, "We place this stone in faith and hope to the glory of God, through Jesus Christ our Lord."

The stone being adjusted, and his Royal Highness having given it three strokes with a mallet, the Provincial Grand Master approached the stone, and proved it to be properly laid by the plumbrule, presented by the J.G.W.; the level, presented by the S.G.W.; and the square, presented by the D.P.G.M.

The Architect then delivered the maul to the Provincial Grand Master, who gave three knocks, at the same time invoking the blessing of the Grand Architect of the Universe, and the brethren responded.— *So mote it be.*

The Provincial Grand Master delivered the plan and tools to the builder, for his use, after which he scattered corn and poured wine and oil upon the stone.

The Provincial Grand Chaplain then gave the appropriate prayer, the brethren again responding— *So mote it be*, when the Provincial Grand Master announced to his Royal Highness and the Mayor that the stone was laid.

The Bishop of Winchester then audibly repeated the following prayers:—

"O, Almighty God, who hast built Thy Church upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the head corner-stone, grant us so to be joined together in unity of spirit by their doctrine, that we may be made an holy temple, acceptable unto Thee, through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen."

"O most glorious Lord God, we acknowledge that we are not worthy to offer unto Thee anything belonging to us; yet we beseech Thee, of Thine infinite goodness, graciously to accept and bless our intention of rebuilding in this place a house, which may be for ever dedicated to Thy honour and service. May the people bring forth the head-stone thereof with shoutings, crying 'Grace, grace unto it!' May the glory of this latter house be greater than the glory of the former. May faithful men be raised up from generation to generation, who within its walls may proclaim the glad tidings of salvation and the riches of Divine grace. May Thine holy days be here remembered —Thy sacraments duly administered and reverently received— the youth instructed— the aged reminded of their duty, and exhorted to persevere unto the end— and all builded up as living temples of the Holy Ghost, that Thou mayest bless us, and we may honour Thee, through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen."

The Lord's Prayer followed, after which the following appropriate hymn was sung by a most effective choir, accompanied by selected instruments from the Royal Marine band, led by Mr. John Mew, the organist of St. Thomas's church :—

This stone to thee in faith we lay;  
To thee this temple. Lord, we build;  
Thy power and goodness here display,  
And be it with thy presence fill'd.

Here, when thy people seek thy face,  
And dying sinners pray to live. 
Hear thou in heaven, thy dwelling-place;  
And when thou nearest, Lord, forgive!

Thy glory never hence depart;  
Yet choose not, Lord, this house alone:  
Thy kingdom come to ev'ry heart;  
In ev'ry bosom fix thy throne!

The benediction having been given, The Bishop of Winchester then said— Your Royal Highness, I tender to you, on behalf of the Mayor and Town Council of this ancient borough, of this island, and of the assembled multitude of inhabitants whom your Royal Highness can see around you, their respectful and grateful acknowledgments for your great condescension in coming amongst us on this interesting occasion. It will be out of place for me to make any lengthened observations; but the inhabitants would, indeed, have gone away with sad hearts if they were not allowed an opportunity of thus expressing the feelings they entertain towards your Royal Highness. It is the greatest of comforts to us to be enabled to do so; I speak not only in the name of the clergy and people of this island, but in that of the people of Great Britain, who, as I have said, consider it a subject of great comfort in seeing in their beloved Sovereign and in their beloved Sovereign's Prince Consort those who not only evince so great a desire to dignify their position by doing everything that is valuable to the welfare of our country, but in themselves set a bright example of all that can ennoble the people. As one of the clergy of this country, I consider that your Royal Highness's attendance this day is better than a thousand sermons. It shows that a hearty interest and sympathy are felt by our gracious Sovereign, and by your Royal Highness, in an event so interesting to the people of this town and to the people of this Island. We see in it an additional proof of the interest our gracious Sovereign and your Royal Highness take in the welfare of this Island.

His Royal Highness, who was evidently much gratified, said— My lord, allow me to express to you the feeling of gratification I have this day experienced in being amongst you and assisting you in the performance of this holy work, and in doing so I wish also to bear testimony to the great interest the Queen takes in all matters of this kind in the nation at large, and in the welfare of this Island in particular. I thank you for this honour —(loud cheers).

The ceremony being completed, the procession was again formed, and returned to the Town Hall, and on reaching the north door, it stopped, and fell back in double line, to allow his Royal Highness to pass through the entire procession, to the Town Hall. His Royal Highness had a few minutes conversation with the Mayor, and re-entered his carriage amidst hearty congratulation.

The guests afterwards retired to the arcade of the Town Hall, until luncheon was announced. The Masonic brethren repaired to their lodge-room, where the business of the Grand Lodge was resumed, and at three o'clock they dined at the Star Hotel.

The 77th Regiment, under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel White, formed the guard of honour on the occasion, the other line of procession being kept by detachments from the 20th and 28th Regiments.

The bands of the Royal Marines and the 4th Regiment performed "most eloquent music" during the day, as well as several local bands of the neighbourhood.

The Town Hall was externally covered with evergreens and flowers, while internally the scene was of a magnificent character. At one end, appropriated to the principal guests, was a dais, over which was displayed the banner of Newport, and around the room were hung festoons of laurels and flowers, with devices in dahlias and other flowers. The tables were covered with every delicacy and the choicest wines, the banquet being provided by Messrs. Mew, of the Bugle inn. There were several beautiful paintings adorning the walls, with the designs for the new church, and the fine life-like full-length portrait of the late Sir Leonard Holmes. The tables were bedecked with several massive silver epergnes, cups, and dishes. The Mayor took the chair, supported on his right by the Bishop of Winchester and on the left by General Lord Downes, the Ven. Archdeacon Wigram, Colonel Rumley, Colonel Delacombe, T. W. Fleming, esq. The whole of the clergy of the Island, and amongst the general company were Lieutenant- Colonel Dwyer, Captain Symonds, Lieutenant and Adjutant Driver, Lieutenant Pearse, Lieutenant Taylor, Dr. Wilday, M.D. Commander Adams. Captain Daly, Captain Henries, Captain Scott, Lieutenant Wesley, Captain Gordon, R.M. Lieutenant Manners, Lieutenant Waterworth. Captain Crozier, R.N. Hon. A'Court Holmes, Colonel Harcourt, M.P., Admiral Symonds, Le Marchant Thomas, esq. Sir Henry Oglander, bart. A. J. Hambrough, esq. B. Kerr, esq. L. P. Lind, esq. &c. The principal members of the Corporation, including Messrs. Hearn, Estcourt, Pragnell, Jewell, H. Mew, E. Way, J. Way, &c. were present.

Grace having been said by the Rev. Allen Wallace,  
the Mayor called upon the assembly to charge their glasses, and proposed the health of her most gracious Majesty the Queen. The toast had always been received with every demonstration of loyalty, and he felt assured all present would do honour to it— (great cheering, the band performing the National Anthem).

The Mayor said he now rose to propose the health of the illustrious Prince, who had that day honoured them with his presence on the occasion of laying the foundation stone of a building dedicated to Almighty God. His Royal Highness had conferred a lasting obligation upon the inhabitants of Newport, and had set a noble example to the junior members of the Royal family. He trusted all would join with him in the prayer that the blessing of God might descend upon the great work of the day; and he hoped that the building, the foundation of which they had so auspiciously laid, might rise in all its beautiful proportions, and that thousands yet unborn might worship beneath its portals— (cheers).

The Mayor proposed the health of his Royal Highness the Prince of Wales and the other members of the Royal family. This day would be an illuminated page in the history of the Island, and of the country, and the rich and poor, peasant and peer might look to the Throne for example. The Royal family were the nation's hope; and his wish was that God might confer his blessing upon them, and that they might shine like gems around the diadem of our beloved Sovereign— (cheers).

The Mayor desired to propose the health of the Lord Bishop of Winchester and the clergy who had done them the honour to assemble on the occasion— (cheers). It would ill become him, in the presence of his lordship, to offer any laudatory remarks; but in these momentous times they, as laymen, must not forget the high privileges which they enjoyed. It was most consolatory to them to know that the clergy of the Island, when difficulties beset their path, applied with confidence to the Lord Bishop for advice and counsel— for the advice of one who bad always shown himself unwavering in the principles of our reformed religion— (cheers). He thanked the clergy for the assistance they had rendered and the honour they had done him on the occasion, and he was quite sure that those around him would respond to the toast with enthusiasm—(great cheering).

The Lord Bishop of Winchester, addressing the assembly as Mr. Mayor, his lordship, and gentlemen, said he rose without a moment's hesitation to offer on behalf of the clergy of the Island, and in his own name, their respectful acknowledgments for the honour which had just been paid to them. He might truly say that this day was one of unmixed gratification to him. He had looked forward, now through many years, to the day which should see the foundation-stone laid of that edifice, which he trusted would prove one of the best buildings of the town, in every sense of the term, and become a credit not only to that place but to the whole Island— (cheers). He looked to the church, which, under God's blessing they hoped to raise within the town, not merely as an architectural building, although in that view he should not be the last to acknowledge its merits; but he looked to it as a spot where those who came after them, as well as themselves while they remained here on earth, might repair for consolation and instruction in righteousness— (hear, hear, and cheers). He considered that the auspices under which the church had been commenced that day should lead them to expect a happy termination of the work—(hear, hear). The introduction which the Mayor had given relative to the Royal family, had reminded him of the many obligations they owed to the Royal personage who had so condescendingly honoured them with his presence— (cheers). His Royal Highness Prince Albert had manifested a deep interest in all works for the advancement of art and science and in addition to the efforts made for the advancement of literature, science, and art in this country— to which such a response had been made— Royal Highness united in that which must be most dear to them, a deep feeling for the moral and religious welfare of the people of this country—(cheers). He saw in the presence of his Royal Highness that day that he took an interest in the spiritual welfare of our countrymen, and he recognised in a proof that their Royal neighbour, the Sovereign of this country, as well as her Royal Consort, were willing to be ranked, not only as the Sovereign of the country and the Royal Consort of the Sovereign but as neighbours to them— (great cheering). These were truly auspicious circumstances, and he might well call upon the Mayor in common with his fellow townsmen to rejoice and give God thanks for that which would long be remembered as a day of unmingled happiness amongst the townsmen of the Island— (cheers). He begged to return, on behalf of himself and on behalf of the clergy of the Island, their respectful thanks for the honour done them— (cheers).

The Mayor next proposed the Army and Navy. The sister services were fighting for our hearths and homes in a foreign land, and not only for our hearths and homes but for the hearths of those who were not sufficiently strong to act against the powerful aggressor— (cheers); and it would be seen that they would act with that daring and bravery which had ever distinguished the British soldier and sailor— (cheers). It was not only for the liberty of a foreign nation they were fighting, but for a nation at home, in order that we may live in that peace and prosperity which we had so long enjoyed. He would couple with the toast the names of his distinguished visitors, General Lord Downes for the Army and Captain Crazier for the Navy—(cheers).

Lord Downes, in the name of the Army in which he had the honour of serving, desired to return their thanks. The Army had almost been in a dormant state for some long time, but we might probably now hear of their success under the excellent management of Lord Raglan, and he trusted that the prayers of those who assembled within the church that day would be for the success of our gallant army—(cheers).

Captain Crozier, R.N. said, as the senior officer of the Navy present, he returned thanks for the manner the Mayor had proposed the toast and for the flattering reception it had met at their hands. He felt confident that wherever the servicea of the Navy, as well as of the sister service, might be called for, they would zealously and gallantly do their duty— (Cheers). He once more returned, on behalf of the service, his sincere and heartfelt thanks— (cheers).

The Lord Bishop of Winchester felt that he had already too long delayed in proposing a token of respect to the Mayor and Corporation of the town which they so well deserved. In assembling his friends around that table, the Mayor had conferred upon all of them a deep obligation, as he looked upon these opportunities of meeting each other with peculiar interest; it afforded him the opportunity of meeting those whom he could not at all times be amongst— not only the sister services of the country but those who were more closely allied with him, and who now all united together and took the opportunity of assembling round the social board in the interchange of kindly feeling and intercourse with each other— (cheers). He spoke the feelings of the clergy of the Island, and might he not hope those of the laity of the Island as well, and he would call upon all to join with him in drinking the health of the Mayor of the borough and of the Corporation of which he filled so worthily the chief office— (cheers).

The Mayor said it was certainly, and must be, a memorable day they had passed through, in the records of the borough. The Prince Albert had honoured them with his presence, as well as their lordships, the Lord Bishop of Winchester and Lord Downes; but they had witnessed a circumstance of far greater consequence —they had laid the foundation of an edifice to be erected for the service of the Almighty— (hear, hear), a building which would not only be useful to them, but for generations yet to come— (cheers). They had watched that dear and time-worn building— they had looked at it with feelings of the deepest veneration —in it their forefathers had offered up their praises and their prayers— and he and others could have wished it might be renovated and preserved; but on mature consideration they felt that the building had become in too dilapidated a condition, that age had worked its way, and after a lapse of time they had applied to the task of re-building the church. They never could forget the zealous efforts of one who could not be present with them but whose heart's feelings were still with them, the Rev. Joseph Maude —(cheers). To his exertions they owed very much, and they regretted deeply his absence, but his place in their labours had bean zealously filled by the reverend gentleman who succeeded him. The Rev. G. H. Connor—(cheers); and through their united efforts they had found that, after removing their old building, they had raised sufficient to carry up the body of the church, and trusted that when that time arrived the Providence which had enabled them to raise between £7000 and £8000, would still smile upon them, that they might see the building carried out as it was shown upon their design, that they might see the tower as well as the body of the church erected— (cheers). The Lord Bishop of Winchester had kindly contributed, many gentlemen around the table had done the same, they had embarked in the work entrusted to them, and God grant they might have the strength and assistance to carry it out— (cheers). He saw many Aldermen and Councillors around who could speak for themselves; but for himself and on behalf of the Corporation, he returned most grateful thanks— (cheers).

Mr. Alderman Estcourt, after a pause, said as he had been waiting for the senior members of the Corporation to return thanks, he had hesitated to rise. He never, until that day, thoroughly appreciated the honour of belonging to the Corporation, by whose combined action had been gathered such an honourable assembly on that occasion. He returned thanks on behalf of himself and the other members of the Corporation— (cheers).

The Mayor said the next toast was one respecting which he felt some diffidence in approaching. It was the health of the Provincial Grand Master, who had left the room to join in the duties of his lodge, and the Masonic brethren—(cheers). Although these gentlemen kept many things in the dark, some would shine forth; they could see that the brethren visited the fatherless and the widow, relieved the distressed, and came forth in any work which had for its ends the benefit of mankind, and they might therefore conclude that their principles and motives sprung from the purest source— (cheers). He was honoured by their presence and thanked them for their attendance. He gave them the toast of the Masonic brethren, coupling it with the name of Brother Waterworth-(cbeers).

Mr. Waterworth acknowledged the toast, and said that although there were many good men in the town who were not Masons, there could not exist a Mason who was not a good man (hear, hear, and cheers). He concluded by returning thanks for the Masonic craft.

Mr. W. B. Mew also acknowledged the compliment.

The Mayor said with the next toast he had really arrived at the foundation. They looked around and thought of the men who had originated the work, and, with the exception of those who had been called to their fathers, had steadily persevered in it up to the present time, those gentlemen being the Church Building Committee— (cheers). In the first place there was a strong feeling that the church should be renovated, but this being found impossible, they then set themselves to the work of erecting a new building, and they pledged themselves, collecting subscriptions from year to year, to commence the building within a period of five years. They had to fight a great battle to get together their funds, and had carried out their intention at the expiration of the fifth year of their labours— (cheers). There was one gentleman whose exertions had been most strenuous, who had given them sound advice, and had been constant in his attendance on the committee: the Rural Dean was known throughout the length and breadth of the Island—(cheers), his kindness and condescension were proverbial, and they had much thank him for that the church was commenced that day He called upon them to drink the health of the Rev. E. M'All and the Church Building Committee —(cheers).

The Rev. E. M'All * could not express the gratitude he felt at the high consummation at which they had arrived that day, a consummation which would give to the town of Newport, and to the whole of the Isle of Wight,  a church worth of its metropolis— (cheers).

The Mayor said the next health was that of the Rev. E. D. Scott, the Vicar of Carisbrooke, whose desire at all times was do that which would prove of advantage to them, and add to their general contentment here and happiness hereafter. The gentleman would make a most important announcement but before doing so they would have the gratification of drinking his health — (great cheering ).

The Rev. E. D. Scott returned thanks for the compliment, and added it would ill become him on a day like that to delay them but he would simply say that he would consent, with all his heart, to a separation of Newport from the Vicarage of Carisbrooke— (enthusiastic cheering).
 
The Rev. Bursar of Queen's College, Oxford, said an application had been made to them that they should forward the separation of Newport from the united parishes of Carisbrooke and Northwood, and appropriate a portion of the great tithes toward its endowment, and that proposition they had unhesitatingly accepted— (loud cheers), and, acting upon the advice of the Lord Bishop of the diocese, they had resolved that means should be taken towards erecting Newport to a separate parish— (cheers).
 
The Mayor rose to propose the health of the Rev. Mr Connor, minister of St. Thomas's, who came amongst them when bereft of a pastor whom they all knew and esteemed, had to put his shoulder to the wheel, and had to work hard in the good cause in which they were embarked— (cheers).

The Rev. Mr. Connor, in returning thanks, said his own poor efforts would fall very far short of success, were they not aided by his reverend brethren, especially the Rev. Arthur Pennington whom he must thank for his kindness and support in all matters connected with the parish— (cheers).
 
The Mayor then proposed the health of the Rev. Arthur Pennington.
 
The Rev. Mr. Pennington said his desire and endeavour was to labour with Mr. Connor in promoting the spiritual interests of the town, and so long as he was spared his endeavour should be to promote its spiritual and its everlasting welfare— (cheers).
 
The Mayor proposed the health of Colonel Delacombe, of the Royal Marines, with thanks for the use of the band.

Colonel Delacombe suitably responded to the toast.

Lord Downes gave the health of the Ladies who had worked for the bazaar.
 
Mr. E. Way proposed the health of the Rev. Bursar of Queen's College, Oxford.
 
The Rev. Bursar, in acknowledging the compliment, said although the proposition made by Newport was received favourably by the College, it could not have been carried out for an indefinite time but for the Vicar, the Rev. Mr. Scott, who had very kindly and liberally brought the matter on to its present position, and thus enabled the College to carry out the wish of the inhabitants of Newport, with whom they very kindly sympathised —(loud cheers).
 
The Mayor proposed the Vice-Presidents, Messrs. Eldridge (Town Clerk), W. Way, and Jewell.
 
The Town Clerk acknowledged the toast.

Mr. J. Wyatt, of Oxford, responded to the toast of the Ladies.

The Mayor expressed his gratitude to the military authorities at Parkhurst for their co-operation at all times with the civic power, and gave the health of Colonel Rumley and the officers of Parkhurst Barracks— (cheers).

Colonel Rumley responded, after which the health of Captain Scott and the Isle of Wight Artillery Militia was given and responded to.

The Royal Marines band, which played an appropriate selection of music in the intervals between the toasts then performed the National Anthem, and the company separated.

It is worthy of remark that during the whole of the day's ceremonies the large mass of people that crammed the town behaved with the utmost decorum, and no accident of any kind happened.

The Annual Licensing Day was on Wednesday, when thirteen new applications for spirit licenses were made, and eleven of them were granted *instanter*— the others were only adjourned for the purpose of producing the usual certificates of character.

[SIMILAR REPORT TO ELSEWHERE]

...

[NOTABLE GUESTS] [a]nd about 180 of the principal personages of the island filled the surrounding tables. We hear that this banquet off with éclat; but owing to the spirit of exclusiveness which the Committee was actuated in inviting only a portion of the press, we are sorry we cannot afford our patrons that full report which we usually do of such aristocratic gatherings; but have no doubt they, with us, will feel with us that such a petty and ridiculous distribution of their favours in no way redounds to their credit. It will have this effect that the most aristocratic portion of the Island visitors will be saved the trouble of wading through the after-dinner stereotype speeches used on such occasions.

Owing to the late hour the Freemason's banquet came off the report is postponed till next week.

We cannot close our report without making mention of the scurvy treatment got at the hands of the managers of this pageant. With a partiality, as rare as it is contemptible, they invited *portion* of the Press only, albeit they were glad to accept of the gratuitous puffing of *all*. Let this not be understood as the language of complaint; but rather as showing another instance of the unscrupulous manner in which some will "grind their axe" upon others. We have, however, discharged our duty to the subscribers and patrons of the *Observer* in the best manner we possibly could under such unusual and grossly partial circumstances.

Hampshire Advertiser - Saturday 11 February 1854

County Petty Sessions.— Magistrates present: The Hon. A'Court Holmes, and Sir H. P. Gordon, bart.

On Saturday, James Nobbs and Edward Woodford were charged with breaking into the house of Mr. John Hewitt of West Cowes, grocer, and stealing £25. Alfred Hewitt described the premises, which were secured in the usual manner on the previous Saturday night. The next morning a writing-desk, containing £65, a missionary-box, and two spirit decanters, were found to have been taken from the parlour. Mrs. Hewitt gave similar evidence. Sarah, wife of Joseph Woodford, deposed that Nobbs was at her house on the night in question; he said he was waiting for Ned Woodford. She heard Woodford's voice outside, and said. "There is Woodford." He then left, and at half-past two he returned, and said. "Arn't you gone to bed yet?" Mary Phillips deposed that Nobbs came on Sunday to the Tontine, Newport, and asked to have some dinner, for which she charged 1s. He gave her a sovereign in payment and said he was going to sea, round Alexandria; that he had drawn a month's pay, and came to have a spree before he went. A Policeman came to inquire about him, and she pointed him out. Elizabeth Georgiana Watson, a woman of the town, deposed she lived in the Tontine-yard. Nobbs came to her lodgings on Sunday evening. She saw that he had a sovereign and half-sovereign; he gave her 3s. He took out some dark-looking paper from his pocket squeezed together. She endeavoured to snatch it from him, when he said, "Don't; they are £5 notes." Witness said, "There will be a chance to get the things out of pawn, in the morning, won't there?" He gave her one of the notes, such a one as that produced (National and Provincial Bank). Witness asked for some money to get some drink; he gave her 3d. She went to the Tontine, where she saw a Policeman, and heard he was inquiring for notes. She went back, and put the note in the fire. She afterwards obtained the other three notea from the prisoner, and the man of the house put them also into the fire. Police-serjeant White deposed that he went to Mr. Hewitt's house on the previous Sunday, when he found the shutter had been removed from the court. He could not find where the entry had been effected until Monday. He went to the Tontine, at Newport, and apprehended Nobbs. Woodford was brought to the station on Monday. He made a confession which was produced, signed by him, to the effect that he and Nobbs got into Mr. Hewitt's store about ten o'clock on the previous Sunday morning, by opening a clap, and from thence proceeded to the parlour, where they found the missionary-box, and two decanters of spirits. They carried the things to the store, took out £95 from the desk, partook of the spirits, and left the remainder in a tub in the loft. (The articles were now produced and identified). Nobbs said to witness, when Woodford's confession was read over, that it was all true, except that the desk and missionary box were left in an old tea-chest, and not a tub. Police constable Purchase gave evidence in corroboration. Herbert Barnes, in the service of the prosecutor, gave evidence that he locked up the store, and that one of the prisoners had brought sawdust there on some occasions. No defence was attempted, and both prisoners were committed to the Assizes, on the charge of burglary.

Isle of Wight Observer - Saturday 06 October 1855

During the last week a deputation, consisting of the clergymen of St. Thomas' Church, the ministers of the different dissenting congregations and others, presented the following memorial to the magistrates at the Townhall respecting the social condition of the borough, in the hope that means may be taken to prevent a continuation the present exhibition of indecency and open prostitution which now disgrace its thoroughfares :—

"To the worshipful the Mayor and the Magistrates of the borough of Newport, Isle of Wight.

"The memorial of the undersigned inhabitants of the said borough.

"Your memorialists beg respectfully to state that for some time they have, with many respectable inhabitants, had their attention turned to the moral aspect the borough of Newport.

"A few of the more serious part of the community are laboring, by appliances of a simple, but they trust efficient character, to rectify existing evils; but they fear that, without the cooperation which the municipal authorities can afford, their effort, however well intended, and however admirably conducted, will meet with counteractions too powerful, humanly speaking, for them to surmount.

"Without wishing to cast any reflection upon the municipal authorities, your memorialists request permission to suggest, whether the leading thoroughfares of the borough might not be kept more free from interruption, occasioned by individuals collecting in groups, and frequently conducting themselves in a manner most offensive to virtue — whether the By-Law No. 25 ['Every common prostitute, or night walker, who shall loiter or in any thoroughfare or public place for the purpose of prostitution or solicitation, shall for such offence forfeit and pay the sum of ten shillings'] could not be put in force, so that by its rigorous execution obstructions to a course of immorality might be lawfully created — whether a stricter supervision could not be exercised over lodginghouses, lest they become the resort of characters for whose use they were not intended, and over public houses and beershops, multiplied, your memorialists fear, far beyond the wants of the borough, and where attractions are held out to make them the rendezvous of persons whose antecedents create a suspicion that they will prove nurseries of vice.

"In imploring the magistrates to exercise their authority for the prevention of crime as far as they can, your memorialists wish to be distinctly understood that they are not seeking any class legislation; their object being the purification of the borough from the social evils which unhappily abound within it, and it is their wish to see every offender, whatever be his grade in life, made amenable for his conduct. Any partial application of the law they would deprecate, for intelligent observers of passing events must see that ail efforts to cleanse the fountains of social life are invariably unpopular and fail, unless even-handed justice be administered all transgressors.

"In conclusion, your memorialists would observe that they address you, not as the organ of any political party, or of any religious denomination, but as inhabitants of the borough, deeply concerned for its highest welfare. Upon your aid they rely as invaluable auxiliary to the various benevolent agencies which are now operating for its social and moral improvement. Their aims, they are free to confess, partake of high and sacred character. On an arm more powerful than that which is human, and on means more effective than any legislation can afford, they depend for their ultimate attainment; but as the work is great, and hindrances from various causes multiply, they desire every kind legitimate of cooperation, and that which an intelligent and a vigilent magistracy can afford they appreciate too highly not to seek, and which, from the known character of the gentlemen who sit upon the beach, they feel persuaded they shall not seek in vain.

"And your memorialists respectfully subscribe their names hereto."

Dr. Wavell, on the part of the magistrates, replied that the bench would do everything in their power to remedy the evils complained of.

Newport, Saturday, October 6.

The Retrograding State of Morals in Newport.

We omitted last week the following memorial, lately presented by the Rev. G H. Connor and other gentlemen to the Magistrates of the borough on this momentous and anxious subject. We have been so earnestly solicited to print the document that we give it insertion against our own inclinations, being unwilling to believe that there exists in the Isle of Wight a place so lost to Christianity, and so devoted to crime, beyond the crying evils of any other place in the kingdom. We are unwilling to believe it. If true, it does not say much in regard to precept and example. The Question arises— how is it that such a social ulceration has been left to fester amidst the general moral healthiness of the island!— to such an extent, too, as thus to meet the severe condemnation of the immediate residents, who *taboo* the town, and will prevent strangers approaching its scenes of vice. Our correspondent says—" We trust all those of the town who have thought seriously of the matter will exert them-selves in every way to *stem the torrent of juvenile profligacy and prostitution*, the streams of which literally choke up our principal thoroughfares of an evening:" This is a horrible picture, and is more out-spoken than the memorial.

[The memorial is then printed in full.]

The worshipful the mayor Dr. Wavell, and others of the authorities present, thanked the memorialists for their judicious suggestive hints, and were pleased in feeling that they had the willing co-operation of the respectable inhabitants of the borough.

The Mayor rose, and said, that he should not be doing justice to his own feelings or to the town if he did not bring before the Council the grows insult which had been cast on them by the address, the Tempter and Tempted, written, it was said, by a gentleman lately come to reside there, the Rev. Carus Wilson, and it was with no ordinary feelings of indignation that he found the beastly tract had been taken to his house, and was in the hands of his family and female domestics; could any honest man, could any father of a family avoid feeling grieved that such gross accounts of vice should be brought to defile the minds of young persons? He was more astonished and indignant to find that copies had been delivered to the children at the Sunday schools, and the National schools. He hoped the British schools had escaped the pollution. He considered these females who distributed such a work and placed them in the hands of children a disgrace to their sex. He regretted that these meddling troublesome fellows who were interfering where they had no connection with the town, and he should have thought that Mr. Smith might have found other ditties for which he was paid by the Treasury, rather than interfering with the town of Newport. He felt it his duty to deny most clearly, and to protest most strongly against the falsehoods and calumnies which had been circulated respecting the Borough of Newport. He asserted firmly, and would prove his assertion that there were few more moral towns than Newport and no garrison town where there was so little debauchment. He could prove by official returns which he had obtained, that the health of the soldiers their general morality, while at Parkhurst, were much above the average. He could not have allowed the Council to have separated without throwing off the foul imputation, and pressing from his heart the indignation he felt at the insult that had been put on them, and the town.—Mr. W. B. Mew concurred in the sentiments and feelings expressed by the Mayor, and denounced the exaggerated statements about the town, which had been put forth.—Mr. Robert Pinnock congratulated the Council on the course taken by the Mayor, to revel the calumnies which had been indulged in thousands of the books, had been circulated, and unless contradicted, might cling to the town. He asked the Mayor whether he would take it up as the organ of the Council, & repudiate the calumnious attack on the town. Its origin could be traced to a new movement that had been organized in the memorial addressed to the Magistrates, and to a newspaper paragraph. He considered that the sooner such proceedings were discouraged the better.—Mr. Pring said the memorial had been handed to the Watch Committee, of which he was one, and after the strictest investigation, they came to an unanimous vote, that there was no cause to interfere with the general arrangements. He had lately been in most of the towns in the kingdom where the military were near, and he said with confidence, that Newport for order, quietness and morality, surpassed all the others. Some persons were over nice, and he thought the Town Clerk might as will stay at home, as to go about interfering with others.—Mr. Eldridge (Town Clerk), said he was one of those who agreed with the memorial; he thought it was quite right, and no censure ought to be cast on those who were parties to it. The attention of the Magistrates was called to facts which were patent to all Gentlemen, and if those present had seen the report of the Town Missionary, which Dr. Wavell and himself had presented to them weekly, they would know the amount of vice which prevailed.—The Mayor said they had no right to sit in judgment upon others, they had no authority to judge and collect accusations against their neighbours. If this was the occupation of a Town Missionary, the sooner he was removed the better.—Mr. Eldridge said he knew that he had lifted up many who had been cast down, and he could tell of those in higher places, whose conduct would not bear investigation.—Mr. Pinnock said that the missionary was engaged to raise up the frail, but the course pursued by him and his employers, had turned out a curse to the town.—Mr. Wilkins and Mr. Morgan expressed similar feelings with the other members of the Council.—Mr. W. B. Mew wished to know by what authority these men had set up this court of inquisition; he felt indignant at their presumption. There was a newspaper once circulated in the town, called Paul Pry, which was very objectionable, and caused unpleasantness in many families but this was much worse, as the scandal was handed from one to the other, without the knowledge of the person whose reputation was attacked. If this Paul Pry defended by Mr. Eldridge, went into these abodes of sin and temptation, he ought to be exceedingly good; as pitch could not be handled without defilement. The exposure that day should induce the Town Clerk to cut such acquaintance, and he could not help feeling disgusted that men should be found, who could listen to the reports, full of scandals and libels on their neighbours.—The Mayor said he was afraid there was a great deal too much of spying and prying going on. After a long conversation, it was determined that it should be left to the Mayor either to write in his own name to the Rev. Carus Wilson or in that of the Council contradicting his statements, as embodied in the address "Tempters and Tempted." Since the meeting of the Town Council and the exposure of the system of espionage which has been carried on in Newport, principally by the means of the town missionary, Mr. Tucker, several subscribers have determined to have their names struck as they never contemplated that they were paying their money to gratify the curiosity of individuals, or to rake up scandal against their neighbours.

Hampshire Telegraph - Saturday 09 February 1856

MEETING OF THE NEWPORT TOWN COUNCIL.

The Quarterly Meeting of the Town Council was held on Tuesday, the Mayor, John Henry Hearn, Esq., in the chair.

...

It was proposed by Mr. Pinnock that the foot pavement leading towards Parkhurst Barracks should be extended as far as the boundaries of the Borough, and that measures be taken to obtain a footpath to the Barracks and Prison.

Mr. B. W. Mew hoped to see a foot-path lighted from the town to the Prison.

A committee were then appointed to report on the subject.

...

The Mayor— I should not do justice to my own feelings or my duty to the town, if I were not to bring, before this Council the insult which had been offered by the publication of the "Tempters and Tempted." It was with no ordinary feelings of indignation that I found the beastly tract had been thrust into my house, and copies were in the hands of my family and female servants. I was still more astonished to find that they had been delivered to the children of the Sunday and National Schools; the British Schools I hope escaped the pollution; and for such books to be placed in the hands of children by females I consider it a disgrace to their sex. There were meddling, troublesome fellows who interfered where they had no right, having no connection with the town. I should think that Mr. Smith could find plenty of duties at Parkhurst Prison, for which he is paid by the Treasury, instead of mixing himself up in these transactions. There was no doubt it was the work of a Mr. Wilson, a gentleman who had taken up a temporary residence in the Island, but a good deal of it must have been supplied by others. I again deny the accusation, and protest against the slander. With so many soldiers in the neighbourhood, perfection could not be expected; but with perfect confidence I assert that in no garrison town in the kingdom was there so little debauchery; and from information he had obtained from an official quarter, the health and morals of the troops at Parkhurst were above the average of other places. I cannot help expressing to this Council the strong feelings I entertain at the foul indignity that has been put on us as a town.

Mr. Pinnock congratulated the Council on the bold manner in which the Mayor had met the foul accusation, which had been circulated; and which, uncontradicted, might prove an injury to the town. Thousands of copies had been issued, and he had heard that more were to be sent abroad. He traced the scandal to the new movement that had been organised in Newport, to the committee and memorial afterwards published in the newspapers, and considered it the duty of all to discourage such proceedings.

Mr. Pring, as one of the Watch Committee, said, the memorial had been handed to them, and its contents discussed, and they came to an unanimous vote that there it was no just ground for interference. He had travelled much, seen many places where soldiers were near, and fearlessly affirmed that a quieter or better conducted town was not to be found in the kingdom. Some persons were over nice and expected perfection, and he thought it would be quite as well if their Town Clerk were to stay at home as go about interfering with others.

Mr Eldridge (Town Clerk), rose and said, he was one of those who agreed with the memorial; the memorialists did not intend it as a censure, but called the attention of the magistrates to a fact patent to all. He had nothing to do with the "Tempters and Tempted," but if gentlemen had seen the lists brought to him and Dr. Wavell weekly, they would be astonished at the amount of crime and the persons committing it; he could name some of the higher classes.— (Great sensation.)

The Mayor said they had no right to sit in judgement on their neighbours; such conduct was indecent, and he held those who stirred in such things as exceeding their duty. Persons slandered had not the ordinary means of defence, and if that was the office of the missionary it was using it for evil.

Mr. Eldridge said the missionary had raised up many bowed down with sin.

Mr. Pinnock thought if the missionary was engaged to raise up the frail it was not intended that he should be a spy; it would be found that he was a curse to the town.

Mr. Wilkins and Mr. Morgan expressed opinions in unison with the other members of the Council.

Mr. W. B. Mew would like to know by what authority Dr. Wavell and Mr. Eldridge set themselves up as inquisitors on others; such conduct raised the indignation of every one worthy the name of man. This missionary was worse than the Paul Pry Newspaper; there you could find out what was said, but this was a private inquisitor. How he could go amongst such vice as he described without contamination he could not think, for it was difficult to handle pitch without being defiled. He was surprised at the Town Clerk; he would advise him to break off such acquaintance as early as possible.

After a desultory conversation it was agreed that the Mayor be empowered to write to the Rev. Carus Wilson, either in his own name or that of the Council, repudiating the description he had given of the Town of Newport in his tract, "The Tempters and Tempted."

NEWPORT, Saturday, February 9.

Town Council Meeting

The quarterly meeting of the Newport Town Council took place on Tuesday.

...

The Reported Immoral State of the Inhabitants of Newport

The Worshipful the Mayor rose and said, there was one painful matter affecting the interests of the town which he considered it his duty, as their chief Magistrate, to bring before the Council. His feelings had been lately shocked on finding that a disgusting pamphlet, entitled, "Tempters and Tempted," had been industriously circulated about the town, and by one means and the other had found its way into almost every house; and he was sure he was sharing the feelings of every, rightminded head of a household, when he said that such vile slander against their town as was therein contained ought to be emphatically and publicly protested against— (hear, hear). He could not express the indignation he felt on learning its contents, and finding that everyone in his house, excepting his wife, had read its contaminating pages; and greatly astonished was he to find that those tracts had been placed in the hands of the children of their Church Sunday and other schools by females— he would not say by ladies. He would ask if expressions such as these— "Your town is on fire with the flames of licentiousness and lust" — were fit for the minds of tender children to dwell upon? And were they not a gross insult, and a libel on the inhabitants of the town? And by whom was this shameful tract written? Not by one of the pastors or ministers of the town, but by a non-resident, who had nothing whatever to do with the town, assisted by another meddling, troublesome busybody, who, he should think, would be far better employed in his business at the Prison at Parkhurst. The parties to the tract were Carus Wilson and Henry Smith; that was an undisguised fact, and the stigma with which the town had been branded would doubtless be most pernicious to the interests of it; and he did say they (the Corporation) ought to do all in their power to destroy its baneful influence. The assertions in it respecting the general depravity and debauchery of our town were infamously false. There was not a garrison town in England that was so free from the charge as Newport— (hear, hear), and he had it from undoubted authority that there had always been less average disease in the Garrison at Parkhurst than at any other, arising from such vicious habits as are imputed to our town. He would, therefore, once again say, that these infamous and unfounded assertions respecting their borough ought to be thus publicly denounced— (hear, hear).

Mr. Pinnock said he was proud their Chief Magistrate had shown the moral courage thus to speak out against a matter which ciations than the Mayor had, and desire him to take such further was calculated to be a most serious injury to the town, if not thus publicly disclaimed. And they ought to go further in their denun- steps as be might deem expedient to stop the thing— (hear). For such a false and shocking report of the state of morals of the inhabitants of Newport was unjust to the Magistracy of the Borough, and he regretted to be obliged to further state that some of the members of their Council had been, in a measure, parties to it. They first had their attention drawn to the immoral state of the town by their Town Clerk, some of the ministers of religion, and other parties living in the town, waiting on the Magistrates, at the Town Hall, as a deputation, requesting them to lend their influence, in their public capacity, to suppress vice and immorality in the town; then there were paragraphs in the newspapers on the subject; and at last there were found religious fanatics ready to make a handle of those pharisaical "good intentions," and scandal was the consequence, which if not met in some such way as this, the town was likely to suffer most seriously. He had some knowledge of other military towns, and it was with thankfulness he felt that Newport was a paradise in comparison with any of them.

Mr. W. B. Mew fully coincided in the censures which had been passed on the authors and circulators of this most injudicious and injurious tract.

Mr. Pring considered at the time that the said deputation took upon themselves to wait upon the Council and lecture them upon the immoral state of the town, that they were going somewhat out of their way, and could not help thinking that their worthy Town Clerk, who headed that deputation, would have been better employed in his office. However, they thought perhaps there were some matters which might be rectified, and instructed their police to be watchful and keep the streets clear, and people moving; and their inspector had shown that generally speaking there was no necessity for interference except on Sundays, and then it was a delicate matter, as people stood about talking with each other after coming out of the various places of worship. Well, the police, in the execution of their duty, civilly requested a group, who were thus standing together in the High-street, to "move on," and they turned out to be a tradesman's family, who had since been to them complaining of the impertinence of the police in this respect. He had opportunities of being acquainted with the state of other military towns, and he could say with Mr. Pinnock, that Newport was not to be compared with any of them. Take Portsmouth, Winchester, Chatham, or even the fashionable town of Southampton, and immorality exhibited itself in a much greater degree in those towns than in Newport— (hear).

The Town Clerk (Mr. Eldridge) replied, that as far as the memorial which had been spoken of went, he believed he and the other parties connected with that movement had acted with perfect consistency, and had done nothing in it but what was proper. Their attention had been drawn to the retrograding state of the public morals of Newport, and they were anxious to use every exertion legally to stem the growing depravity of the town— which was patent to all. With respect to the tract in question, he had read it, and thought it a very injudicious publication, and feeling this, when their town missionary spoke to him respecting some which he had for circulation, he told him it would be unwise to do so, and that he had best not have anything to do with it. But, nevertheless, he thought the less said about the matter the better. He and Dr. Wavell had the weekly inspection of the Town Missionary's report book, and they unhappily knew that many moving in the higher ranks of life were guilty of fostering the immorality of the town by their own immoral conduct —(great excitement, and cries of "Order" from both sides of the Chamber).

The Chairman must call Mr. Eldridge to order. Such Observations were in very bad taste and most improper, and they could not be heard sitting there in judgment on their fellow-townsmen; and he was surprised and vexed to learn that such a spy system had been adopted of diving into matters of privacy, for the purpose of getting up a Quixotic crusade against an evil which, by parties thus acting with such indiscreet religious zeal, would be the very means of increasing the evils they would wish to suppress. The utmost they could do was to put down dancing- houses and brothels, prevent broils and lewd and improper conduct in the streets, and keep public-houses as orderly as possible. Beyond this they could not go— (hear).

Mr. Pring to Mr. Eldridge— And by what means and authority do you and Dr. Wavell get the regular inspection of this Town Missionary's Report-book?

Mr. Pinnock— And if this is his mission, the sooner he is out of the town the better. Such a man is a curse to the town!

Mr. Eldridge— Not a curse. A blessing, I hope. His book is strictly private. No one but Dr. Wavell and myself, who sign it weekly, see the book.

Mr. Morris Morgan— It has been said that the Town Missionary had been told not to circulate the tract; but he had reasons for believing that he did distributed them, and he had been informed that he had also given certain information to Carus Wilson on the subject— (exclamations of "Oh!")

Mr. Mew was astounded at what had been elicited during this discussion, and expressed himself in the most severe terms of disapprobation at the idea of some of the authorities of the town being so mixed up with such a disreputable matter— and they, too, professing themselves to be Christians! Such conduct was scandalous and abominable, and was only second in infamy to the Paul Pry newspaper espionage that was some years ago the medium of so much scandal and abuse, and had such a baneful effect on society. He thought if Mr. Eldridge felt rightly on the matter, he would at once cut the acquaintance of this Town Missionary, at least.

After some further stormy observations— many of the Council joining in the discussion—it was agreed that the Mayor should take what steps he might consider necessary as a still further disclaimer to the false and injurious reports which had been so industriously circulated concerning the reputation of their borough; and the Council broke up with anything but delighted feelings.

BOROUGH PETTY SESSIONS, Monday Feb. 25

Before J. H. Hearn Esq. (Mayor), Thomas Cooke and Edward Way, Esqrs.

James Lewis, alias Nobby Ducks, who had been taken into custody on Saturday evening, for selling the letter of the Rev. W. Carus Wilson, in answer to one sent him by the Mayor of Newport, respecting the tract "the Tempters and Tempted," appeared in court. The defendant had been liberated on his own bail, and retained Mr. George Prince Joyce as his legal adviser. It was told on his appearing in the box that there was a charge against then put several questions to the Bench, but was answered that his client was discharged. He applied for an order for the restitution of the pamphlets, and was referred to the inspector of Police.

COUNTY POLICE

Libel Case.— An extraordinary meeting of the County Magistrates was held on Monday, at the Guildhall, to hear the charge made by Mr. Francis Pittis, of Newport, against the Rev. W. Carus Wilson, for having written a false and scandalous libel on his character. The court-room and gallery were crowded with persons of interest of the Town, and other parts of the Island. The Bench consisted of the Hon. a'Court Holmes (chairman), Sir John Simeon, Bart., Capt. Kerr, Capt. Brigstocke, Thomas Cooke. and J. A. Hambrough, Esqrs.

Mr. Eldridge appeared for the prosecutor, and Mr. Ford for the defendant. The latter handed in a Medical Certificate that the health of the defendant would not allow of his appearing that day. The case proceeded without his presence. Mr. Eldridge observed that it had been said a good name was a man's best inheritance, it certainly was above all earthly treasure. He was bound to say, his client had the respect of all who knew him, and he must say that the high and honourable position which Mr. Pittis holds, as Alderman of the Borough, makes him careful of not allowing even shadows to be cast on his reputation. In a certain tract, imputations are thrown on his character, and although he feels free front all aspersions, he could not allow them to pass, whether intended or not, without a public denial of their application. He believed they were not intended, but that the defendant, with great zeal, had exceeded his duty; for when a man steps out of his way, on the delicate ground of private character, he must treat the subject in a delicate manner, and not rush hastily to commit wrong; because he might think there was some good in the distance. No one who reads the tract and pamphlet, can doubt that they reflect seriously on the character of the town, and on individuals; it is not simply a degree of bitterness, but there are the most unwarranted innondoes. He did not stand as an apologist for vice; but it was a most unfortunate circumstance, that when a memorial had been presented to the magistrates which they admitted would check crime and immorality, that these works should have been brought out. He admitted there was much evil, and when he had the honour of filling the office of first magistrate, he, like those in office now, could only deal with cases brought before him. There were cases of gross immoral houses always complained of, by parties, who would never come forward to prove the cases within their own observation. Plain allusions had been made in the pamphlet to the Town Clerk,—he would say, that his observations in the council were misunderstood and misreported. He was sensible of the evils in the Town, and with others had endeavoured to diminish the amount. A certain journal came before him, but only shewing the operations of the society. It did not refer to any member in the council, or to any one in authority; it was merely a record of the poor persons who had been visited. An apology of an ample character having been given completely satisfactory, Mr. Pittis felt he had done his duty to himself, and wished to show he had no vindictive motives.

A letter was then brought forward and read.

Mr. Ford said he represented Mr. Wilson, and he regretted that of the observations made by Mr. Eldridge, would compel him to say more than he had intended, which was simply to offer the fullest apology and explanation to Mr. Pittis. Mr. Eldridge had shown that Mr. Wilson was fully justified in the course he had taken, by the admissions made by himself: on the part of Mr. Wilson he was instructed to say, that that gentleman had the fullest confidence in the integrity and strict morality of Mr. Pittis, and that the quotation from the letter of a friend at Bristol, although one or two circumstances appeared to correspond, had no reference to him, and he begged again to say that there was no imputation intended to be conveyed, and read the letter purporting to be one from Bristol.— Mr. Ford said that if there should be a republication, the passage affecting Mr. Pittis should be taken out.— Mr. Hearn attempted to express his dissent from the course adopted, but was stopped by Mr. Ford, who said that he and the bench had only to do with Mr. Pittis, it was quite irregular.—The chairman after a consultation, said, that as the case had been compromised, they were of opinion that Mr. Hearn should not be heard. Others were affected besides Mr. Pittis.— Mr. Hearn said that others were implicated in the charges, and the apology was made to them, he would not be precluded from taking proceedings in another place.— Mr. Eldridge observed that Mr. Pittis felt that after this ample apology, he should not be acting as a man or a Christian to press the case.— The chairman said that the course pursued was very creditable to both parties. Mr. Pittis very properly came forward to vindicate his character from the vile suspicion. With regard to the pamphlet, every one must see that it was intended for Mr. Pittis, but no one would believe it of him. He hoped Mr. Wilson's friends would advise him better than to re-issue the tracts. He could not perhaps control his zeal, but he hoped he would not use it in such an uncalled for way. He was sorry that Mr. Pittis should have had occasion to appear that day. Mr. Wilson said the quotation did not apply to Mr. Pittis, and they were bound to believe him.

`[Editorial]`

The immorality existing in our large towns is a matter of serious import. It is a question that requires patient investigation. It is an evil that demands a speedy but powerful remedy. The fastidiousness of a falsely-delicate Age may indeed ignore the existence of the evil, or, while admitting its existence, may seek to keep it out of sight ;—but, unhappily, it has grown—it is growing—to such dimensions that so tender a mode of dealing with it is as absurd as it is criminal. We have no patience with that tender modesty which is offended by the exposure of a great vice. We mistrust the delicacy that is so very readily shocked—the morality that shrinks from dealing with a fearful guilt. What should we say of the physician who denied the existence of a festering wound because he dared not attempt to heal it? What then, is the position of those who seek to shroud in vice the darkness of a willing ignorance, because they are unable to grapple with it?

Our attention has been directed to a remarkable controversy between the representatives of a large town on the one hand, and a servant of the Church of England on the other. We have refrained from entering into a discussion of its causes or results, until the whole question was fairly before us. We have now, however, given our most serious attention to the matter: and though we are conscious that the deliberate expression of our opinion will expose us to considerable obloquy, we are not disposed to shrink from what we conceive to be our duty as public Journalists. We have humbly attempted, in the discharge of our Editorial labours, to call the attention of our Readers to various social evils that seemed to us worthy of patient consideration; we cannot, therefore, refuse to record our opinion in a matter that is of vital importance to the welfare of Society.

The Rev. W. Carus WILSON, M.A.,—a gentleman whose position renders impossible the imputation of an interested motive—struck with the profligacy patent to all who have eyes to see and ears to hear in the streets of Newport,—as in the streets of every populous town— addressed a brief and earnest remonstrance on the subject to its inhabitants. In this remonstrance, entitled "Tempters and Tempted," he probed with a firm hand, the deadly wound. He stated there some facts of a harrowing nature, whose counterparts, alas! are not unknown to those who have had their attention directed to this subject. In eloquent, in burning words, he drew a picture of the sad condition both of the Tempter and the Tempted. He alluded to the causes of this wholesale immorality. He made an affectionate appeal to those "in high places," to endeavour to check the growth of this terrible evil. Shortly after the circulation of this impressive Address, the Mayor of Newport brought it under the consideration of his Town Council. Well, what then? Of course, our Readers will say, the Mayor and his fellow-townsmen appreciated the generous charity of Mr. Wilson, and they determined to adopt, if possible, some remedial measures. —For observe, Mr. WILSON did not at first say the town of Newport was worse than any other town, or, at least, any town in the neighbourhood of large Barracks. The evil is notoriously not confined to Newport; but Newport alone fell within the sphere of Mr. WILSON'S ministrations.—But the Mayor, in a most vehement denunciation of "meddlers;" a majority of the Town Council in speeches marked by an utter want of reverence for Mr. WILSON'S sacred office, denounced his Tract as "beastly!" Now, we have carefully perused it, and are not afraid to say—it contains nothing that could shock the most refined delicacy! However, these gentlemen distinguished themselves by a warm rivalry in the employment of the most violent phrases. As for immorality—who ever heard of it in Newport? Who ever saw a drunkard? Who ever had his eyes polluted by disgusting sights, or his ears profaned by oaths and obscene expressions? Vice? how should it enter into those sacred precincts which a Mayor and a Town Council watch over?

Now is it wise—this attempt to cover up a deformity, to slur over an evil? Is it not better to grapple with a difficulty than simply to shut one's eyes and deny its existence? Why, the existence of those vices to which Mr. Wilson alluded is notorious. They are gradually undermining our national character. They menace the national prosperity. They flaunt in the open thoroughfares. They force themselves upon the observation of our sisters, our children, our wives. What are we to do then? To meet in solemn conclave and resolutely ignore them? To heap abuse and obloquy on the head of any zealous-minded, true-hearted man who bares the evil to our unwilling eyes? No: it is the duty, the privilege—would it were the boast!—of those who sit "in the high places," who administer the affairs of a large town, to devise some remedial measures. We do not say that these horrid iniquities can be utterly rooted out. We know that the Golden Age is yet far distant. But undoubtedly much may be done. By removing Temptation. we may check the increase of Crime. We wish however to guard ourselves from any imputation against individuals. The character of gentleman like Messrs. Hearn and Pittis is, as it should be above suspicion.

Inhabitants of Newport! are you all as easily shocked as the members of your Town Council? Do you in truth, or do the majority of you, approve of their attempt "to burke" the Ministers of Religion? Do you not rather believe that Mr. Wilson deserves your warm gratitude, your earnest sympathy, for the effort he has made to "make a sunshine in a shady place?" Parents who have daughters, brothers who have sisters, owe their heartiest thanks to Mr. Wilson.

We trust, above all, that the Clergy of Newport— nay, the Clergy of the whole Island— will make common cause with Mr. Wilson, and support him in his brave opposition to Falsehood, Immorality and Slander. We know that they feel deeply the importance of the question. We know that they sorrow over the magnitude of the evil with which he has dared to grapple. We believe that they will therefore gladly come forward and support him with their countenance, their encouragement and their exertions.

For our own part, we hold that "that to the pure all things are pure." We hold that the mind is never contaminated by the exposure of a great vice, or the portrayal of its terrible consequences. If, indeed our streets were free from pollution—if it were possible to bring up our sisters or our daughters so that they should be ignorant of the existence of the drunkard or the children of shame—if their ears could be shut, their eyes closed against the sights and sounds of vice—it might he unwise to force upon their notice evils of which they were happily ignorant. But the drunkard reels through the open street. The shameless woman pours out her curses in the public places. So let us warn those who see the effects, the dread results of Vice against the subtle approaches and insidious allurements of Temptation. Let us look upon these evils as deformities which stand out in all their horror in the very noonday sun. Let us grapple with them by providing for the ignorant wholesome knowledge, for the weary innocent recreation, for the young safe shelter from the foes of Truth and God. Let us build up Schools in the stead of Beershops. Let us each in his individual sphere diffuse the blessing of a good example. Let us teach the Lower Classes the value of purity of mind, thought, of speech. Let us train up the Boys of our Towns and Villages to reverence decency, and shun the profane word, the obscene jest. Let us aid one another in charity and good works, and welcome the truthful words of those who—like the Rev. W. Carus Wilson—are not afraid to bare to the light the wounds of the Social body, in defiance even of Mayors and Town Councillors!

BOROUGH COURT. Monday.— Magistrates present: The Mayor, and Thomas Cooke, esq. 

"Tempters and Tempted."— James Lewis, a second hand dealer, appeared to answer a summons, for publicly hawking and selling the pamphlet addressed to the Mayor of Newport by the Rev. William Carus Wilson, notwithstanding the public caution which had been placarded by James Eldridge, esq., to the effect that it was libellous; but no one appearing to prosecute, the Mayor informed him that he was discharged. He, however, looked imploringly on the Bench, with the apparent feeling of a martyr, respecting certain sequestered property in the possession of the Inspector of Police, in the shape of a bundle of tracts of which he had been relieved when taken to the Station-house on Saturday; and George Prince Joyce, esq., who appeared as his legal adviser, respectfully informed the bench, that unless they were immediately restored to his client, he would bring an action against the Magistrates. The Mayor said the defendant might apply to the Inspector, who could use own discretion in the matter.

At the Borough Petty Sessions, on Monday, before the Mayor, Thomas Cooke, and Edward Way, Esqrs.

James Lewis, who had been taken into custody on Saturday evening, but liberated on his own recognizance, for whom Mr. G. P. Joyce appeared, was told there was no charge against him. It appeared that in consequence of a caution signed by Mr. Eldridge, Town Clerk, that the pamphlet containing a letter of the Rev. Carus Wilson, in answer to the Mayer of Newport, was a libel, the defendant was taken into custody for selling the book. Mr. Joyce Wished to know by what authority his client had been taken into custody, and also whether the books would be returned. The Mayor said there was no charge made against James Lewis, and he must apply to the Inspector of Police respecting the books.
 
"TEMPTERS AND TEMPTED."

At the County Police Court, on Wednesday, before the  Hon. A'Court Holmes, Chairman, Sir John Simeon, Bt., Capt. Kerr, Thomas Cooke, Esq. Capt. Brigstocke, R.N., and J. A. Hamburgh, Esq., the Rev. Wm. Carus Wilson was charged with writing a false, scandalous, and malicious libel on Mr. Francis Pittis. The Court was crowded in every part, and the proceedings excited the most intense interest. The libel arose out of the publication of a tract, "The Tempters and Tempted; or a solemn Address and Warning to the Inhabitants of the Town And Neighbourhood;" in which the state of morals is put as the very worst that language can describe; and fierce denunciations are hurled on its devoted population. At a meeting of the Town Council a strong denial of the justice of the charges was made and the conduct of the conduct of the author, Mr. Carus Wilson, his informants, and the distributors of the tracts, was severely condemned. The Mayor was requested to write to Mr. Wilson a statement of the views and feelings of the Council on the subject, which he complied with; and then Mr. Wilson wrote and published answer to the letter, as a tract, in which the former charges were repeated, and many new ones made. The charge against Mr. Pittis was of that gross character that he felt it to be his duty to take criminal proceedings against Mr. Wilson, and the Magistrates now  assembled to hear the case. Mr. Eldridge was engaged for the prosecution, and Mr. Ford, of Portsea, for the defence.

Mr. Ford handed in a medical certificate that the state of the health of the defendant would not allows him to appear in Court; and, after some delay, the case went on in his absence.

Mr. Eldridge stated that a man's good name was his best inheritance; it certainly was his highest earthily treasure; and he must say that from the high and honourable position held by Mr. Pittis in private life, and as an Alderman of the Borough, he could not allow the aspersion cast on his character by the letter of the defendant to pass without public notice and contradiction. He did not believe that the defendant intended wrong; but with great zeal, he did not unite that care which ought to guide the course of one who takes part in public affairs— for when a man steps out of his way on the delicate ground of private character, he should touch it gently, and not rush hastily and do injustice because he fancies there is some good to be done in the distance. No one can read the pamphlet but must observe it reflects most severely on the character of these attacked: it is not simply a reply to the letter of the Mayor, but it displays a degree of bitterness and unwarranted inuendo against others, highly to be condemned. He did not stand there as an apologist for vice or immorality, but it was an unfortunate circumstance, that just at the time that a memorial had been presented to the Magistrates, and measures were in progress to remedy some evils, that the rev. gentleman should have made such attacks; he and others should know that magistrates could only deal with cases brought before them. While Mr. Pttis had the honour of sitting as first magistrate of the borough, those very persons who complained of the gross immorality of houses in their immediate neighbourhood, could not be induced to come forward to give evidence necessary to ensure a conviction. Allusions had been made to himself (the Town Clerk), and his observations had been misunderstood and misrepresented respecting a certain journal that came before him. Now that journal did no refer to any member of the Council, or persons its authority, but merely to the cases visited by the Town Mission, persons of the lowest class. He felt pleased that he should not take up the further time of the Court by this pressing the case, as an ample apology had been sent from Mr. Wilson, which would be read; and he considered Mr. Pittis had done his duty in vindicating his character.

Mr. Ford said, he had the honour to represent the Rev. Carus Wilson, and but for the observation of the gentleman who had brought the case before the Court, he should give an explanation, and express regret that the passage was supposed to refer to Mr. Pittis. He must now say, that his client was perfectly justified in the course he had taken; and Mr. Eldridge's remarks confirm the correctness of the state of the town. On the part of Mr. Wilson he begged to state, that he had the highest opinion of the great respectability, integrity, and strict morality of Mr. Pittis; he begged again to say, that no imputation was intended to be conveyed. He then read the following letter :—
    
Boniface house, Feb. 23, 1856.

[To: "F. Pittis, Esq."]

"Dear Sir,— Your letter to Mr. Gustar has been read to me in bed, from which serious illness prevents me rising.

I cannot delay a moment in relieving the wounded feelings which must necessarily have been created if you supposed that I intended to make the slightest reference, directly or indirectly in any part either of the tract or letter, to yourself or any other magistrate of the town of Newport.

"The passage you refer to was entirely taken from a letter sent me from Bristol, from a party wholly unacquainted with Newport, as a comment upon my endeavours to show where the root of the evil too often lies, and was wholly of a general character and irrespective of any particular locality. I particularly regret that any one should have supposed the passage to refer to yourself, as I had always heard and thought of you with the greatest respect.  
"I am, Sir, your's faithfully,  
Wm. CARUS WILSON.

Mr. Hearn said, as Mayor he was not satisfied; the other libels on the Town and individuals remained uncontradicted.

Mr. Ford protested that the observations of Mr. Hearn were irregular; he had only to do with Mr. Pittis.

Mr. Hearn.— There are other charges, and this will not preclude me from taking proceedings in another court.

Mr. Eldridge said of Mr. Pittis that "he feels after the ample apology he should not be acting as a man or a christian to proceed further in the case."

The Chairman observed, that the course pursued was very creditable to both parties. Mr. Pittis vindicates his character from the vile suspicion which might have rested on it, although there was no response in the public, for although all must know that the passage applied to Mr. Pittis, no one would believe there was any foundation for the aspersion. No person could help his zeal, but he trusted Mr. Wilson would direct it better; he hoped he would not re-issue tracts to wound the feelings of others in such an uncalled for manner; and he was sorry Mr. Pittis should have had occasions to appear there that day. Mr. Wilson said that the passage was not intended to apply to Mr. Pittis, and perhaps they were bound to believe it.

Hampshire Advertiser - Saturday 01 March 1856

CHARGE AGAINST THE REV. WM. CARUS WILSON FOR DEFAMATION OF CHARACTER.

The town has been in a state of ferment for the last few days, in consequence of a second pamphlet published by this gentleman, in reply to a letter from the Mayor, J. H. Hearn, esq. on behalf of the town, condemnatory of his proceedings in reference to his first tract. There being certain portions in this last pamphlet which were considered libellous, and particularly in one apparently glaring instance, whereby the character of a principal tradesman of our town was believed to be maligned, placards were issued cautioning persons against their circulation; and on Saturday James Lewis, alias "Nobby Dux," was taken to the Station-house, and bound over in his own recognisances for his appearance to answer the charge of publicly selling this obnoxious tract in the Beast Market on that day. On Monday he appeared before the Borough Magistrates, but was dismissed, as the charge of libel concerning Francis Pittis, esq. by the rev. defendant was just about being proceeded with.

The Town Hall was crowded to excess for some considerable time previously to the case coming on.

The Hon. A'Court Holmes occupied the chair, and on the Bench we observed Sir John Simeon, bart. Captains Brigstocke and Kerr, A. Hamborough, esq. and other gentlemen. The charge against the rev. gentleman was, "That he unlawfully and maliciously did publish a certain false and defamatory libel of and concerning Francis Pittis."

James Eldridge, esq. (brother-in-law of the plaintiff) attended for the prosecution; and Henry Ford. Esq. (of the firm of Messrs. Ford, solicitor, of Portsea) appeared for the defendant.

The Rev. Carus Wilson was not present, and Mr. Ford put into Court a certificate of illness, stating he was confined to his room from indisposition.

J Eldridge, esq. opened the case by observing it had been well said that a man's good name was his wealth, and anything uttered derogatory to his fair fame was calculated to be injurious to him in many respects. Thus Mr. Francis Pittis, for whom he that day appeared, felt himself bound to vindicate his character against the aspersions which he considered had been made by the Rev. Wm. Carus Wilson respecting him, in a pamphlet he had lately addressed to the Mayor of Newport, and which had been the cause of the present legal proceedings. Mr. Pittis held a high and honourable position as an Alderman of their borough, and his standing in society was such that he was certain his fellow-townsmen would never attach to him the slightest imputation of the nature contained in that tract. Therefore, he could not but prosecute the present proceedings, which he felt was due to himself and to the town, however painful it was to his feelings to do so. He would not say that the rev. gentleman did, by the publication of that pamphlet, wittingly and maliciously asperse and defame the character of Mr. Pittis. although it was evident a certain paragraph in it did refer to him, and must have had that effect had not the present proceedings been instituted. He (Mr. Eldridge) believed that the defendant was a good man, and no doubt meant well; but he had acted most indiscreetly. According to his own showing he was on delicate ground; and when a person stepped out of his way, even with the philanthropic object he professed to have in view, he should be careful how he rudely trod upon the fair fame of one whom he acknowledged not even to have known by name. A great deal had been said in the town about another tract- "Tempters and Tempted," out of which the present pamphlet had originated. Of the merits or demerits of this first tract he would say nothing, as the libel which Mr. Pittis complained of was contained in the latter; and no one reading certain lines in the 13th page of the last pamphlet, and acquainted with his client, and events which had happened in their town within the last three years, could have the slightest hesitation in saying that they referred to him and reflected upon his character. He (Mr. Eldridge) felt himself bound further to say, that besides the false and defamatory libel he bad referred to affecting the character of Mr. Pittis, the pamphlet was, in his opinion, not dictated by a Christian spirit; it was penned with a degree of bitterness and exaggeration, and contained unfounded imputations, inuendoes, and sweeping censures, injuriously affecting the character of the Magistrates of the borough, and the inhabitants of the town generally, and not at all creditable to the position of the defendant as a gentleman and a clergyman. Whilst he spoke thus stringently of his conduct, he would wish to be understood that he did not stand there as the apologist for vices which were, unfortunately, too common in their town, although he believed not more so than in other localities; neither did he uphold the evil doings of such men who were well described by the reverend gentlemen as "the mean and dastardly betrayers of female innocence." It was unfortunate for the case of Mr. Wilson, that his pamphlet did not appear until after the Magistrates had earnestly directed their attention to the moral state of the borough, in which they had been strengthened by an influential memorial which had been presented to them, and he (Mr. Eldridge) felt happy in stating that the authorities had not been slack in determinedly and impartially using their endeavours to put down vice and immorality in the town. It was due to them that he should thus publicly state this fact, and he considered it was right the rev. gentleman should know it. He (Mr. Eldridge) had filled the office of Chief Magistrate of their borough, and, consequently, knew from experience they could deal with open immorality only. He instanced a case which came under his own knowledge while presiding over them as Mayor. He knew there was a certain house of ill-fame, where the worst of vices were carried on; he went to the neighbours, who were cognisant of the fact and the only parties who could testify to it; but none could be induced to give the necessary testimony, in consequence of which his efforts to remove the evil were frustrated. He mentioned this circumstance to show the rev. gentleman and his informants how difficult it was to deal with such cases. Reference had been made to him in the pamphlet, as to what he, as their Town Clerk, had said at a late Town Council meeting, in a discussion on the defendant's first tract. He must be permitted to say that his observations on that occasion had been misrepresented in the town, and somewhat mis-reported, and from these circumstances certain parties in the Town Council had been pointed to as if his remarks had referred to them. He wished thus publicly to state, that while there were many things in the Town Missionary's journal, showing the immoralities which unhappily existed among those he was in the habit of visiting, there was no record impugning the characters of those not under actual visitation. What he then was about to state was, that "unhappily some painful circumstances had occurred amongst persons of a higher class"— At this point of his observations the Mayor stopped him, and nothing further was said by him. He (Mr. Eldridge) would most distinctly state that he did not refer to any one in the Town Council, or to any other person in authority, but to one or two cases which were well-known to the town. In conclusion, he would state that Mr. Pittis was wholly and entirely innocent of the charge alleged against him in the pamphlet. He would not, however, proceed further at present, as he understood that Mr. Ford, on the part of the defendant, was ready to offer an explanation and apology; and he should, therefore, pause to hear if it were of such a full and ample character as he could advise Mr. Pittis to accept.

Mr. H. Ford rose to reply. He regretted Mr. Pittis had been so hastily led to the conclusion that the pamphlet, in reply to the Mayor's letter to his client respecting a former tract, contained libellous and defamatory remarks respecting him. What the rev. gentleman had done in these pamphlets was to write against the vice and immorality which existed generally in Newport: and Mr. Eldridge, in opening the case, had admitted that fact, by stating that a deputation bad appealed to the magistrates as to the existing bad state of the borough in this respect. With regard to the imputation which was said to apply to Mr. Pittis, his own character and standing in the town should have eased his conscience or any anxiety he is said to have felt in the matter; and he (Mr. Ford) could not but think that he had unhappily been induced to take these proceedings against his client, through the persuasions of others, that the objectionable sentence upon which this inquiry had been raised referred to him. He was pleased, however, to be able to prove most conclusively that when Mr. Wilson penned these words, the notion never for one moment entered his mind that they would in any way apply to him, having never heard aught of that gentleman beyond his bearing a character for the strictest integrity and the greatest morality. His client had certainly discovered, since the publication of that pamphlet, that there were one or two circumstances bearing on a former official position of Mr. Pittis in their town, which did seem to give a colouring to the assertion complained of as applying to him; but he would most emphatically assure them, that from an investigation he had made, he was enabled to state that the Rev. Mr. Wilson never received the least intimation from any individual detrimental to that gentleman'a character; and to show the Bench that his client was desirous of removing this false impression as soon as he knew of its existence, he (defendant) wrote the following letter to Mr. Pittis, which he would read to the Court :—

"Boniface-house, 23rd February, 1856.  
"Dear Sir,— Your letter to Mr. Gastar has been read to me in bed, from which serious illness prevents my rising.

"I cannot delay a moment in relieving the wounded feelings which must necessarily have been created if you supposed that I intended to make the slightest reference, directly or indirectly, in any part, either of the tract or letter, to yourself, or any other magistrate of the town of Newport.

"The passage you refer to was entirely taken from a letter sent to me from Bristol, from a party wholly unacquainted with Newport, as a comment upon my endeavours to show where the root of the evil too often lies, and was wholly of a general character, and irrespective of any particular locality.

"I particularly regret that any one should have supposed the passage to refer to yourself, as I had always heard and thought of you with the greatest respect.

"I am, sir, your's faithfully,

"F. Pittis. Esq." "Wm. Carus Wilson.

In order further to satisfy Mr. Pittis, he (Mr. Ford) had shown him the original letter which his client had received from Bristol. He trusted that this public avowal on behalf of his client would be sufficient to meet the circumstances of the case; and he would give his pledge that whatever farther use might be made of the pamphlet in question it should be suppressed in its present form, and he would remove the three or four lines from it which had been considered offensive. Mr. Pittis at the same time would be at liberty to make whatever use he pleased of the correspondence he had in his possession on the subject, and he trusted that the explanation which had been given, and the apology he had made on the part of his client, would be sufficient to satisfy Mr. Pittis and the town generally.

J. S. Hearne, eqs. here rose and said, that as the Mayor of Newport he could not in duty to the town, could not allow the present opportunity to pass without—

Here he was stopped by Mr. Ford, who insisted that such a procedure on the part of Mr. Hearn was most improper, and no one knew better than he did that it was out of all order.

The Mayor, however, persisted, amidst the suppressed applause of the court. The bench had power to decide, and he therefore appealed to the honourable chairman.

After a minute's consultation, the Bench observed, as they believed the apology which had been made on the part of the defendant would most probably be accepted, they did not consider that as the town of Newport generally had been referred to in the case, Mr. Hearn, as its chief magistrate, should be debarred from making some observation with reference thereto.

Mr. Ford responded, that he trusted Mr. Hearn would be guarded in his remarks, and not make any charge affecting his client.

Mr. Hearn observed, all he rose to say was— that the apology offered Mr. Pittis, on the part of the defendant, should by no means preclude him from preferring a charge against him in another place on behalf of the borough, should he be so advised (a burst of applause here ran through the court).

Mr. Eldridge then rose, and said be was instructed by Mr. Pittis to state that he had accepted the apology of Mr. Ford on the part of the rev. defendant, and he felt he would not be acting the part of a Christian if he had refused to do so. With respect to the steps he had taken, he did not see how be could have acted otherwise. Let them look at the circumstances of the case. In 1854, Mr. Pittis, as their chief magistrate, attended the laying of the foundation stone of their new church, on which occasion they were honoured with the presence of the consort of her Gracious Majesty, the Prince Albert. He (Mr. P.) afterwards presided at a dinner at the Town Hall—there toasted the health of the Bishop of Winchester—and spoke of the church of his forefathers. Now let them compare these circumstances with the following extract from defendant's pamphlet :-" Of the magistrate who presides at a dinner toasting a Bishop after the consecration of a church, and spouting about the church of our forefathers." [Mr. Eldridge did not finish the sentence, which contains the libel-" while known to be a frequenter of the brothel."] And then let any person say whether or not they would not have taken these remarks as reflecting upon Mr. Pittis as their then Mayor, and referring to no other person. He did trust that in future Mr. Wilson would be really cautious in publishing and putting into circulation stories affecting the characters of individuals, obtained from the loose assertions of others— and of which he admitted he had no personal knowledge whatever. Such conduct he could not but say was most derogatory to the Christian Character

At the conclusion of Mr. Eldridge'a observations, the crowded court signified their approbation by several outbursts of applause. The Hon Chairman observed, that the course which Mr. Pittis had pursued on the matter was in every respect a very proper one, and his acceptation of the explanation and apology which had been given in behalf of the defendant was most honourable to him. The steps he had taken were only such as were necessary to vindicate his character from the imputations which certainly did previously appear to the Bench to have been levelled at him; although he would not for one moment believe the censure implied in the pamphlet as referring to him found a single response in the public mind. It would be superfluous on the part of the Bench to state that the well known moral character of Mr. Pittis —his standing in society, and the high estimation in which he was held by all who knew him, raised him above any foul aspersions which might be uttered regarding him; and as they had heard what defendant by his counsel had said respecting the offensive paragraph in the pamphlet, and that he most distinctly asserted he did not in any way allude to him, he (the Chairman) considered it was unnecessary to make any further remarks about it. But he could not refrain from saying, that he considered such tracts as those the rev. gentleman had thought proper to publish and put in circulation, affecting the town of Newport, were quite uncalled for and most injudicious, and not at all reputable on the part of the defendant; and he did trust he would altogether withdraw them, and be better advised in future.

After expressions of approbation on the part of the assembly, the Court broke up.

Mr. Thomas Butler, printer, of Ryde, and Mr. Henry Medley, of Ventnor (the printer of the last pamphlet), were also indicted, but they were not called upon.

OPENING OF A SOLDIERS' INSTITUTE AT PORTSMOUTH.

On Wednesday evening a meeting was held on the opening of the Soldiers' Institution, which has been established in King-street, Portsmouth, to afford the soldiers quartered this garrison a library, reading-room, and other conveniences, in which they can employ their time in reading, or other rational amusements during their leisure hours.

The Institution has been established mainly through the instrumentality the Rev. W. Carus Wilson, who first brought the subject forward, and who has been nobly seconded by the officers in the garrison.

Above 100 soldiers, principally of the Artillery, were present at the meeting, nearly fifty whom gave in their names members of the Institution, at the close of the meeting.

Captain Tate occupied the chair, and was supported the Rev. Mr. Childs, Rev. W.C. Wilson, Capt. Campbell, Capt. Savage, G. Rylands, Esq., C. Bintead, Esq. Revs. J. Knapp, J. Power, Capt. Hawke, and others, would have been there, had not circumstances prevented them.

The Chairman, in opening the proceedings, said that for the formation of the Institution they were greatly indebted to the philanthropic spirit of the Rev. W. C. Wilson, through whose exertions it had been brought forward. In the Institution the soldier would find every comfort—newspapers, library, coffee rooms, and every means of rational instruction and amusement, which he hoped would keep many from the haunts which abounded in the town, and lead them to understand that a vicious course of life was incompatible with true happiness. (Cheers.)

Rev. Mr. Childs said he would endeavour to place before the meeting the object they had in view in forming the institute. He formerly lived in a garrison town ( Devonport) for some time, and well knew what inducements were held out to young men in such towns to lead them into wrong paths, and the necessity there existed for the formation of some counteracting influence. The rev. gentlemen then pointed out to the meeting the hideousness of vice, by relating an incident which occurred during his residence Devonport. It was at the death-bed of a woman, who some years previously had been instrumental in causing a marine—her companion in vice—to be transported for a felony, which she, herself, had committed. He described the fearful effects produced by conscience in her last moments, and continued: Their object in forming the institution was to provide them with a "Clubhouse," as it might called, where, when they left their barracks, they might have a lounge, read the papers, and perhaps meet a friend—where they might smoke their pipe, spin a yarn, and fight their battles over again. (Cheers.) If they did not like smoking, there was another room where they could have a quiet cup of coffee, and a comfortable chat with a companion. The room they were now in was the general room, where they would have placed upon a table all the news of the day, by which they might watch their companions in arms fighting for their country in other lands. (Cheers.) They would also have library and class rooms, where he hoped they would get mutual instruction amongst themselves. They did not want see them crammed with lectures, but see them gathering honey for themselves. That was a great fault in Mechanics' Institutes; they gave information, without teaching men to exert themselves; it was if they crammed the stomach without causing them to earn their bread by the sweat of the brow. If they did the latter, they were better in physical health, and if they strove to learn themselves they would be better in mental health. (Hear, hear.) They wanted to see them form classes amongst themselves, in which those who were well instructed might help the others. It was also desired that they should have the management of the institution in their own hands; that a committee of management should be formed out of the members. As there was a United Service Club, so they wished to form a kind of club for the troops in garrison, and upon its auspicious opening he begged to congratulate them. (Applause.)

Rev W. Carus Wilson, who in rising was received with much applause, said that whatever they did in the way of contributing to the comfort and happiness of the soldier, was only the payment of a moiety of the debt of gratitude which they owed the brave defenders of our country, and which had been much increased during these critical time. He had long seen the necessity of the formation of such institutions and he must say that, although he had taken part in various undertakings, none had given him greater pleasure and satisfaction than the little efforts which he had been able to put forth on behalf of the soldier. He had been much abroad of late years, and had caused many thousand Bibles to circulated in Italy, especially amongst Sardinian soldiers. He should not enlarge upon this subject, as he had promissed to attend a meeting of the Soldiers' Friend Society the following Wednesday evening, when he hoped to give much interesting information respecting his labours in that field; he would therefore simply state that the work had been eminently successful; both officers and soldiers had taken an interest in it and that at the camp at Boulogne, as well as in Italy, many thousands of Bibles, besides innumerable tracts, had been circulated amongst the soldiery. After speaking of the assistance he had received in the latter piece from the Rev. Mr Brown, the reverend gentleman said that it was a great delight to his mind to meet them that evening, but it was not necessary for him dwell on the advantages of the institution, as that had been so ably done by Mr. Childs, but he would remark that there were many collateral as well as direct advantages attendant upon it. He was glad to see the assimilation of ranks which it produced—that whilst the officer had his club-house, the soldier should have the same, for there was something exceedingly interesting in the fact that men of all ranks and classes were likely to be provided for. He hoped, however, they were as but the commencement of the work, for it was his longing desire to see the "The Soldier's Institute" made as perfect as possible, not only because this was the largest garrison town in the kingdom, but as an encouragement to other places to follow their example. (Cheers.) Some friends at Dover had already made application to him to assist in forming one for the barracks at that town, and he was sure he should find willing helpers there. (Hear, hear.) It would be gratifying to them to know that the proceedings were receiving countenance, not only from the officers of the army universally, but from higher quarters.— Lord Panmure having expressed himself favourable to them. (Applause.) The rev. gentleman then read a letter which had been addressed to Lord Panmure by a military chaplain; it spoke of the temptations to which the soldier was subjected, and remarked that although they could not expect to remove these altogether, it was their duty to do what they could to counteract their influence, and recommended the adoption of a plan similar to that carried out in the formation of the Portsmouth Soldiers' Institute; he said that the ordinary library in the barrack was not sufficiently attractive; something on the principle of a *café* being the *desideratum*. This, continued the speaker, had met with the full approval of Lord Panmure, and whilst considering that they had commenced under very favourable auspices, he hoped to see the day when no garrison town in England would be destitute of such an institution. There was one point he would wish to refer to with to with respect to the collateral advantages of the institution. He thought it best to have it distinct from the barracks, as it would be a greater change for the soldiers, and it would enable them to fraternise with soldiers of other regiments; it would bring them out from the contracted limit of their own little circle, so that they might compare notes with one another. He thought this an important feature in the institution. (Cheers.) He perfectly agreed in the sentiments of the chaplain in the letter he had read—"No acts of Parliament, no efforts of their own, would keep men from evil, or lead them to good;" but although that was certain, they should do what they could. Men's minds were always seeking after happiness and enjoyment, and they should give such a spirit every encouragement in a rational way. In the institution they were now such would be found, and they could enjoy their pipe and tobacco at their ease. With regard to smoking, that had been a debated point, but it was ultimately decided that such should be allowed to all who wished to pursue it. In the library they would find books of all kinds, but although they were not all religious books, he would not disguise from them that the great object they had in view was to make them true soldiers of the Cross, for there could be no true happiness without holiness. Many other things would be given them, and they might rest assured that if they found the premises too straight for them, they should be widened—(cheers)—for they would not rest content without endeavouring to promote their happiness, and he would conclude with expressing the earnest hope that God's blessing would rest upon them and their undertaking.

Captain Savage being compelled to take his departure, the Chairman said, that previous to his doing so, he was sure they would all join in giving to him their hearty thanks for the part he had taken in the undertaking. (Loud applause.) Had it not been for the hearty 00-operation of Capt. Savage and other officers, all the efforts of Rev. Mr. Wilson would bare been unavailing. The proposition was carried with acclamation. Captain Campbell would only say a few words, as so much had been said the objects of the institution previous speakers. Thirty years ago, when in India, be could net help noticing the demoralising character of the army, and he therefore congratulated them that they lived in different times. He hoped they would appreciate the benefits of the institution, and that the present building would be found too small for them, when they would find bettor accommodation for them in another place. (Cheers.) would always happy to contribute his mite, and would conclude by wishing prosperity to the undertaking. (Loud applause.) Rev. W. C. Wilson said there was one little fact which he would like to mention. A friend of his, the late Colonel Hewlett, who fell at the attack the Bedan, stated to him some time ago, that whereas out of his regiment of men, there were formerly 30 morning who were brought before him in consequence of having got, into scrape," since they bad formed institution with library, &c., for the use of the regiment, they had dwindled down six eight. (Applause.) He hoped none in that room would got into such awkward predicaments. Rev. W. C. Wilson, again rising, said he would remark that if any of the members wished to have any alteration or improvement made, their suggestions would receive the utmost attention. Rev. Mr. Childs said that it was desired that a practical committee should bo formed out of their own body, would recommend them to consult together to recommend one from each company or corps, in whom they had confidence, on that committee. Rev. W. C. Wilson read a most beautiful and affecting letter which he had received from soldier at Malta; every word in it breathe a spirit of religious principle, which it was truly delightful to listen to. Rev. W. Livingstone, after remarking on the practice now observed by the greater portion of the clergy of this country, of offering up prayers for the safety of our soldiers during the war, which he stated originated with the Rev. Mr. Wilson, said that the institution had been established to draw the soldiers from the sources of temptation to which was subjected to enable him meet in place where might enjoy himself without danger his morals, with friends belonging to other regiments, so promote that spirit of brotherhood which it was so cheering to behold. remembered not long ago, reading a work in which the writer said the glory of England's greatness had departed, that in the event another she would have no men who could maintain her honour, but he thought that when 8,000 Englishmen kept 25,000 Russians bay for several hours, there was the same enthusiasm * the same unswerving indomitable bravery in them that there ever was (cheers); indeed, he believed more bravery had been shown in the Crimea than at any time in the Peninsula. (Loud applause.) But whilst they bad shown such bravery in an earthly fight, there was a spiritual conflict with the powers darkness, which with God's grace, they should carry on strongly and heroically, and he hoped that the establishment of this institution would enable them carry on that fight with success, and prayed that as they bad met together that evening, they would meet together before the throne grace. G. Esq., as one of the Committee, said that other classes of the community had institutions and associations in which they met together for mutual improvement; and so when Mr. Wilson proposed the establishment of soldier's institute, they thought it but right that the soldier should possess the same advantages. (Cheers.) hoped they would distinctly understand that their wish was that the institution should be under the control the members themselves; and they hoped that if there was any paper placed upon the table which a majority of them did not approve of any other which they would like have, they would inform them it, and their wishes would be complied with. The time which the institution should bo opened would also be left for them decide upon. Every suggestion they might make, which would add their comfort or convenience, would be attended to, as Committee wished to make a model institution from which other towns might take a copy. (Hear, hear.) As had been remarked by former speakers, they would find the table in the room in which they were sitting covered with magazines; the library filled with useful and entertaining books; class rooms, and lecture rooms; they might also, if they preferred it, have some one read to them. Every thing that was possible be accomplished would be done to afford them instruction; and he hoped that not only every one present would join, but that each would induce a comrade go with him. (Applause.) Rev. C. Wilcox, alter stating that the rules of the institution admitted all soldiers the garrison its benefits on payment of a 1d. per week, said that coffee also would furnished the lowest possible price. He had determined be the first taste the coffee made in the institution, and he must any that never tasted any better in England. (Applause.) The committee had also decided on opening the institution on the Sunday, not for reading the newspapers, or anything secular character, but for admittance to the religious works in library, &c. (Applause.) To make the work quite complete, the institution would be furnished with materials for amusement (but not for gambling) in the shape of draught and chess boards and men, backgammon, and a bagatelle board (cheers); these would be supplied with the understanding that, directly or indirectly, no gambling would be allowed. one set of any of these was not found be sufficient, was sure the Committee would gladly furnish more. (Applause.)

A vote of thanks was then given the Secretary, Mr. Batchelor, and the Chairman; and G. Rylands, Esq., having stated that a gentleman (Mr. D. Barker), agent of Soldiers' Friend Society, had come down from Winchester and attended the meeting to obtain some information preparatory to forming a similar institution in that town.

The meeting separated, about fifty, we before stated, giving in their names as members.

Leeds Mercury - Thursday 28 February 1856

SOLDIERS' INSTITUTES.—

On the 23rd January last, the Soldiers' Institute at Portsmouth was opened. It was described in the prospectus, a copy of which has been forwarded to us by a gentleman who takes much interest in the soldiers' welfare, the Rev. W. Carus Wilson:—

"The Soldiers' Institute comprises a reading-room, supplied with daily and weekly newspapers, and most of the  leading and useful periodicals and current literature of the day. Joined to this, a library for the exclusive use of the members, embracing works in every department in literature, as well as others that may prove useful in their profession. Class-rooms for mutual improvement, and occasional lectures, add another feature to the general object. United with the above are two coffee-rooms, which it is hoped will contribute to the comfort of the members, and tend to lessen the frequenting of public-houses. The subscription is fixed at one penny per week, for which a cheque is given, the possession of which entitles the holder to all the advantages of the institute, for so long a period as it is dated for."

It will thus be seen that the Soldiers' Institute is analagous to the Mechanics' Institute, and is calculated to effect much good by furnishing useful employment and the means of innocent recreation during leisure hours. We heartily wish success to the Portsmouth Institute, and should be glad to see a similar plan adopted in other towns. The country would thus in some measure repay that debt which she owes to our brave soldiers.

Newport / Parkhurst barracks couldn't have been that bad?

https://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ukgwa/+/http://yourarchives.nationalarchives.gov.uk/index.php?title=The_Contagious_Diseases_Acts

The Contagious Diseases Acts were introduced in the 1860s for the compulsory examination of women believed to be common prostitutes for their hospitalisation (known as lock hospitals or lock wards) should they be diagnosed suffering from a contagious disease within the meaning of the Acts. The Acts were in reaction to fears that service men were vulnerable to infection from associating with prostitutes and that the Acts would apply to garrison towns and naval ports frequented by prostitutes. The Act of 1864 (27 and 28 Victoria C85) identified the following towns falling within the remit of the Act: Chatham, Colchester, Cork, Curragh, Portsmouth, Plymouth, Shorncliffe, Woolwich. The Act of 1866 (29 and 30 Victoria C96) added Canterbury, Devonport, Dover, Gravesend, Maidstone, Southampton and Winchester. The Act of 1873 did not stipulate particular towns or areas.

## Parkhurst Barracks

As a garrison town, soldiers from a wide variety of regiments were stationed at Parkhurst Barracks, often *en route* to the Crimea via troop ships sailing out of Portsmouth. The muster appears to have reached about 1,300 officers and men at any one time, many of them young men in their teens or early twenties.

PARKHURST BARRACKS. The 23rd Regiment Royal Welsh Fusileers left these barracks on the 25th ult. for Portsmouth, from whence they will embark for the East on or about the 12th, as a portion of the second division to be sent out.

The 58th Depot, which had not been long at Parkhurst, left on Tuesday last for New Zealand.

The 65th Depot also left the barracks on Tuesday last for Weymouth.

The loss to the island generally, especially to Newport, will be greatly felt.

On Monday a Depot of the 63rd Rifle Brigade, of about 150 men, and Tuesday Depot of the 93rd Regiment, of about 100 men, partly filled the place of the above Regiment and Depots.

Owing to the severity of the weather, our poor would have fared badly had it not been for the liberality of the wealthy. As it is, coals, bread, and other comforts have been distributed among the necessitous, and an intimation given that whilst the cold continued the wants of the needy would not be forgotten nor disregarded.

During the week we have had fresh arrivals of recruits for Parkhurst Barracks, and several hundred soldiers of different regiments have left for Portsmouth *en route* for the Crimea, all of whom wore a cheerful countenance and did not appear at all depressed at leaving England; but on the contrary, they cheered lustily, and vowed they would give a good account oft the Russians if they should have the good luck to meet them.

Hampshire Independent - Saturday 11 June 1842

At the Petty Sessions, on Saturday last, before the County Magistrates, at the Guildhall.

— The Colonel of the St. Helens Regiment, together with Capt. Woolcombe, the Governor of the Juvenile Prison, appeared in court to complain of the great number of disorderly females which infested the road leading to the Barracks, and were constantly lying-in-wait around the Barnet-gate, drawing away the attention of the men from their military duty, and occasioning very great inconvenience to the and moreover had been the means of sending many of the soldiers to the Hospital. The Court promised to consider what steps they could take to abate the evil; but it is well known that many of these wretched women —children, we had almost said—had followed the regiment from Winchester and Gosport, and the consequent evils were to be attributed to them. There is, however, a much greater evil existing within the Barrack-palings, and which calls aloud for a remedy. We have no doubt of the justice of the complaint laid by the Colonel of the indecent conduct exhibited without the gate; but is it not a sin against all morals and decency to eject these miserable unfortunates at all times of the night, when caught within the precincts of the soldiers' quarters, to drive them from the gates to find the best of their way to the town without an article of clothing to cover them. Many of these poor creatures have been met by workmen in the mornings crawling along under the hedges and bye-roads in a state of nudity. Surely a remedy may be found without resorting to this indecent and immoral system to put a stop to the intrusion of improper character into the Garrison.

BOROUGH COURT

James Tansom, landlord of the Fountain Tap `[the following week, he was described as the landlord of the Tontine Tap]`, was charged with keeping a disorderly house of the worst description, and thereby creating great nuisance to the neighbours. Tansom declared himself "as innocent as a chick," and that the disturbances which took place at his house was caused by parties who got drunk at other houses, and came to his to kick up a row. The Bench gave their opinion upon the point by levying a fine of 40s. and costs. The defendant, who is both near-sighted and deaf, declared he could not see why they had fined him (laughter).— We understood the charge to have arisen from the misconduct of a private in the St. Helens regiment, who was found there at a very late hour by the picquet, in company with a prostitute. The soldier attempted to escape by bolting through the garret window, cutting divers pranks along the tops of the houses, and amusing himself with pelting the picquet with bricks from the tops of the chimneys. An unfortunate caper, however, caused a slip in his step, and he was precipitated with great violence into the court yard below, receiving very great injury from alighting on the sharp edges of a water tub which chanced to oppose his progress towards his mother earth. He was immediately carried to the hospital.

Hampshire Independent - Saturday 18 June 1842

BOROUGH COURT—  On Monday, before Mr. A. Clarke.— James Tansom, of the Tontine Tap, who was fined 40s. and costs on the previous Monday, for keeping a disorderly house, now stepped into the defendant's box, and pointed out the hardship, injustice, and cruelty, of fining him, he being perfectly innocent according to his own showing. He said be thought it was a very hard case, for he had a sick wife, and scarcely any of the drunkenness was produced in his house; but people got drunk in other houses. and came to his house, and "knocked up a row." Tansom said he had nothing but the public-house to look to for the support of three of them, himself, his wife, and the doctor (immense laughter); and, besides, he had never been brought before magistrates before from infancy to old age (laughter). As soon as he turned his back to draw a drop of beer, they began their rookery again, and he wished the Bench to take "these here things" into consideration.—The Bench said that it was most extraordinary that these rows, by people who get drunk elsewhere, should only occur in his house; that women and soldiers should be found in his rooms day and night, on Sundays and workdays, and yet he know nothing at all of it. These things must be by his own comment, and the penalty they had inflicted was exceedingly moderate, for if he had had his due he would have been indicted at the sessions. They could not alter their previous decision.—Tansom: "Then you must take me to prison, that's all I have to say."

Borough Sessions

The case of the suspended licences next came on. Mr. James Green, of the Row Barge, who was charged with harbouring loose women in the house, having removed them, was permitted to resume his business.

William Farrow, of the Hope tavern, Pyle street, who stood charged with the same offense, was further suspended, the police having deposed to a continuation of disorderly behaviour.

Daniel Webb, of the Tontine tap, was also suspended, in consequence of the depraved morals and indecency still carried on in the house —Mr. Wavell observed that he would not consent that this house (which is the property of the Mayor) should ever have another licence. as it had been a nuisance to the neighbourhood for years.—The Mayor's son, who was present, acknowledged that the house had been very ill conducted, but as the landlord had been fined heavily for his offences, he thought that it had had the desired effect.—The Bench observed that they were in one sense the guardians of the morals of the town, and they considered that houses would be much better conducted if landlords were made aware that the licence would be taken away altogether if such practices were carried on. The magistrates themselves had seen the rows which were taking place every Sunday in that house. Mr. Mew's argument that the landlord had been fined before, was of little avail, as his subsequent conduct proved.—License refused.

John Magee, landlord the Peckhome inn, soother resort for the abandoned and profligate of both sexes, also had his licence refused.

R. Jenkins, landlord of the White Hart inn, said he had taken a room or two opposite for the girls to sleep in, and the police said an alteration for the better had lately taken place in his house.—License suspended.

[We were glad to see the Bench act with a proper spirit on this occasion, and we trust they will be properly supported by the inhabitants in their endeavors to silence these dens of infamy and immorality. We have seen much indecency and immorality amongst the labouring class who are known by the term "navies," but we defy any person to compare their behaviour with the outrageous conduct of the military and the swarms of promotes who are allowed to congregate in these receptacles of vice, and to such an extent has it lately been practised, that no decent person having the wish to his family a good example, dare take them past these detestable places on their way to or from church or chapel on a Sunday.]

BOROUGH COURT

On Monday last, before  P. Scott, A. Clarke, and R. M. Wavell, Esqrs.

Henry Masom was charged by Charles Green, landlord of the Tontine Tap, with stealing 2 bottles containing spirits.

Prosecutor stated that, on Sunday night, the police came to his house shortly after 12 o'clock, and cleared the house. After they had left, he missed two bottles from the bar, containing rum and gin. Prisoner had been in the house all the evening, and was frequently in the bar. The bottle now produced with the rum in it was his property; he knew it by the crooked neck, and a mark on the cork, and had used it daily. The prisoner left the house when the police came in.

Bridget Tegg lives in New-street; saw prisoner at the Tontine last night; left altogether at shut-up time; when they got to the corner, prisoner pulled a bottle out of his pocket, and gave her, telling her to drink, and that it was gin. Witness refused; he then drank himself, and handed the bottle to Ann Gladdis, who refused to drink. A young man named Jacob Chessel, who was with witness, told her that Masom had stolen 2 bottles from the Tontine. Witness carried the bottle home with her, and prisoner threatened to kick the door in, if she would not deliver it up. Witness sent for the police, and prisoner ran away; she gave up the bottle to the police; it was the same now produced; it contained a small quartern of rum.

Ann Gladdis corroborated the above evidence.

P.C. Downer was called upon at half-past 12 o'clock to suppress a disturbance in New Street, at a Mr. Toogood's, where the witness lodged, when he found the prisoner hid behind a tree. Tegg gave him a bottle with some rum in it, which she said prisoner gave her; he said he bought it at Cowes.

The prisoner was then remanded until Thursday.

Hampshire Independent - Saturday 08 January 1848

BOROUGH COURT. On Monday last, before the Mayor, Abraham Clarke, Esq., and Percy Scott, Esq.

...

Charles Green, landlord of the Tontine tap, was charged with keeping a disorderly house.

Richard Cogger, lace maker, said he lived in Cosham-street. Defendant kept the Tontine tap close by. On Sunday evening, about six o'clock, there was a great noise with the soldiers around the house, both front and back. The conduct of the house at all times was most disgraceful. The house itself was a disgrace to any civilised country. There was nothing going on there but continual drunkenness. Soldiers and common prostitutes were harboured there, and there was continual rows and disorders. The most awful language and imprecations were in constant use, which it was very shocking to hear. The inhabitants around could not open their doors without their ears being insulted; even the house in itself as a house was unfit fur public purposes, there being no back door or convenience to it, and the soldiers and the girls came either into the street and exposed themselves or went into the yard, which was common to many other houses. He believed the girls lodged in the house, they were there every day, and drunk every day. He had complained to the magistrates, and to the brewer (Mr. Mew), and as it still kept going on, he thought it time something should be done.

Defendant: You say I harbour common prostitutes in my house, can you prove I lodge any there?

Complainant: I only know they *are* there, I don't know if you lodge them. I don't go into your house to ascertain that.

Harriet Cogger fully confirmed the testimony of her husband.

Inspector Grapes said he knew the house in question. There were constant complaints of the house. Six or seven prostitutes were generally there at a time. Had never found any in the bed rooms. There was dancing and fiddling going on there every night, the same as in four or five others of the same class. Defendant's wife was wholly unfit for the house. Defendant had been to him at least twenty times himself to come over to keep her quiet when she was drunk. Such a house must be a nuisance to the neighbourhood or any house of that description. They paid proper attention to hours.

Defendant said there were two drinking rooms in the house and three bed rooms, no back yard or back door. The soldiers kicked up the row and went outside. He had done his best to keep them quiet. Had been a soldier himself. Was now receiving a pension.

Mr. Clarke.: If you strive to keep your house quiet and cannot, it shows you are unfit to keep it at all.

Mayor: We have proof of very great mismanagement here, and one allegation of suffering drunkenness is sufficiently proved also. There is clear proof that you have offended against two of the principal points of your license. The first, your allowing disorderly conduct, and the second, your permitting bad characters to assemble and meet together therein. Now it is our duty to put down houses as yours as far as we can, and if any house in the town is proved to be a disgrace and a nuisance, and a moral pest to the inhabitants, yours is that house. We do not wish to press upon you too hard, but we hope you will take warning and mit offend again. So long as we occupy this place, and our attention is directed to disorderly houses, we shall feel it to be our duty to put them down, and we owe our thanks to those who will come forward to expose them. At present we shall only fine you £1 and 5s. costs, and we hope you will pay attention to your license.

ISLE OF WIGHT COUNTY PETTY SESSIONS.

On Saturday last, at the Guildhall, before the Rev. W. White and other Magistrates.

Isaac Dore was charged by the Governor of the House of Industry with suffering his wife to become chargeable to the Guardians of the Poor. Defendant said that after being obliged to part with his wife through her dissolute and abandoned course of life, he allowed her five shillings a week, until her language every time she met him became so abusive that he discontinued the allowance, when she threw herself into the House of Industry.

Inspector Grapes was called to prove that he bad known the wife of the defendant a long time as a woman of very loose habits; and he had no doubt that she was a common prostitute.

The Chairman was about to discharge the defendant, saying that no husband could be compelled to support a wife under such circumstances, when it was whispered to his worship that such a course of conduct had been pursued by this abandoned woman for years before the defendant married her, and that he did so with his eyes open to her manifold failings.

Mr. White: Oh, that alters the case altogether. You must pay the cost of maintaining your wife in the house, and the costs of Court, and not let her become chargeable in future.

Hampshire Telegraph - Saturday 02 June 1849

At the Borough Petty Sessions, before the Mayor and Mr. Abraham Clarke, Esq.,—Eliza Lacount, Fanny Castles, Mary Tayler, Ann Gladdis, Emma Kimber, and Caroline Kimber, who had been locked up fron the Saturday evening, and others from Sunday, were complained against by Mr. George Grapes, inspector of police, as conmon prostitutes, and having been found in the streets late at night. The mayor said the magistrates were determined to put down such open and gross vice and immorality. It was enough to call down the judgment of the Almighty, if not attempted to be checked. The court would not deal severely in the present instance, but it was intended as a warning to others and to themselves, if brought again before the court. As the defendants had been locked up a considerable time they would be discharged, with the exception of Emma Kimber, who was intoxicated and fined 5s., and 2s. 6d. costs, or one week's imprisonment.

Abraham Racket, charged by the inspector of police with being drunk the night before, between eleven and the twelve o'clock ;—he was so almost every night.—  Fined 5s. with a notice from the mayor that unless the fine was paid he would be placed in the stocks.

Borough Court.— On Monday, before the Major and other magistrates.

A DISORDERLY CHARACTER.

Mary Ann Downer, a very young woman, was charged by Police Constable Cooke with making a great noise, in company with several young men, near the White Hart Inn, Pyie-street.

The Policeman stated that he ordered her off, but afterwards found her there, with men, at two o'clock; desired her again to go home; they were all making a great noise; she would not go, and he took her to the station-house; had often seen her out late at night. but never knew her noisy before, and when sober she is always quiet. Whilst the girls were out he could never get the men away.

Mr. Grapes, Inspector of Police, in answer to the court, said the prisoner was a common prostitute.

The Mayor observed that he had given instructions to the police to endeavour to check the nuisance and wickedness of such proceedings, and he hoped the sentence he was about to pronounce would be a lesson to her and others. Such courses end in the destruction of both body and soul, and he hoped the punishment would lead her to reflect on the dreadful life she was pursuing.

Fined 10s and Ss costs, which not being paid, she was committed to the House of Correction for fourteen days.

BIRDS OF PARADISE

Jane Blow was charged by the Inspector of Police with keeping a disorderly house, for the purposes of prostitution, in Paradise Row.

Mr. Grapes deposed that he had found 10 or 12 people in the house drinking beer, which they had previously laid in a stock of, at 2 o'clock in the morning, and it was impossible to keep the town quiet under such circumstances. The defendant encouraged her two daughters to open prostitution in the same house, and lived on the profits.

Defendant was liberated on her own recognisance* to appear at the Sessions.

Hampshire Advertiser - Saturday 30 August 1851

Borough of Newport Annual Licensing-day.— The Mayor and Abraham Clarke, esq. sat on Monday for granting licenses to public-houses. Most of the renewals passed without observation, but on Robert Dyer applying for a license for the Old King's Arms, the Mayor made some strong observations on the general conduct and character or the house, stating that unless it was better conducted, the license would be refused next year. He said that observations had been made at the last meeting of the Town Council against the house, and the magistrates felt that they had a duty to perform to the public to prevent the annoyance to the neighbourhood, occasioned by bad and dissolute characters resorting to the house.

The applicant observed, that Mr. John Dyer had better put the saddle on himself, rather than accuse him, as his houses were the worst, being let to prostitutes.

Mr. John Dyer said he had given the parties notice to quit, and that he would see the notice enforced.

The Mayor said it was not a mere question whether prostitution was carried on in the house, for if bad characters were allowed to resort to them, and entice soldiers and others to accompany them, it was not observing the terms of the license.

Mr. Clarke observed that the words or the license were, that he should not allow idle and disorderly persons to assemble and meet together in his house. The magistrates had a duty to perform to the public, and they must enforce the law.

Mr. William Mew made some observations on the remarks made in the Town Council, and thought that the remarks made on the police, and on the Old King's Arms, neither truthful or just.

The Mayor, in granting the licenses of the Valient Soldier, and Tontine Tap, gave a similar caution to the applicants.

BOROUGH PETTY SESSIONS On Monday, before the Mayor, and Abraham Clarke, Esq.

This being the animal licensing day the court was crowded with persons interested.

On the application of Mr. Robert Dyer, of the old King's Arms, the mayor addressed him on the complaint which had been made respecting the bad conduct of his house. At a meeting of the Council, remarks were made which the magistrates were bound to notice, and should the same course be pursued the license would be refused another year. Applicant said Mr. John Dyer had better put the saddle on himself than him, for his houses were let to bad characters and allowed nothing of the sort in his house. Mr. Dyer said he had given the parties notice to quit. Mr. W. Mew, as proprietor of the old King's Arms, denied the statements made in the Council, and said the police had been most improperly charged with partiality in their conduct, Mr. Jenkins, of the White Hart, and Hollywood, of the Tontine Tap had similar admonitions.

Newport Petty Sessions

Saturday—Before Sir H. P. Gordon, Bart, (chairman), A. J. Hambrough, Esq., and T. Cooke, Esq. 

Rebecca Smith, a common prostitute, was charged by William Stevens with stealing his coat.

It appeared that the complainant went into field to fight with another man and the defendant held his coat for him and he had never seen it since, but there being no proof against the prisoner that she stole the coat she was discharged in this case, but was then charged with stealing a book, "Light Hearts and Happy Days," from the shop of Mr. Frank Etheridge.

Mr. Etheridge deposed to having seen the book produced in his shop about a week since, and swore to its being his property by the private mark he had written in it and by his own stamp, which was in the book.

William Bolton, an acting corporal the Rifle Brigade, said that last Monday evening he met the prisoner in the barrack-yard Parkhurst, and that she went into his room with him and another man, and from thence into the canteen, where she showed him the book now produced and asked him if he would like to read it, and when they left the canteen she gave it to him, and he said he would return it to her the next evening, but the next morning he gave it to the pay Serjeant, who, in his presence, gave it to the police constable now present.

P.C. Purchase, being sworn, said—I apprehended the prisoner last Monday night about quarter to 10 o'clock, on Hunny-hill, on the charge of stealing a coat, handkerchief, and some money, belonging to William Stevens. I asked her where the red-cover book was that she had been reading that day, and she said she returned it to its owner. I asked her who that was and she said, you have got that to find out, but she afterwards told me that it belonged to a soldier. The next morning I went to the barracks and obtained the book of a serjeant in the presence of the last witness. I saw the prisoner the same day, and asked her where she got it from but she did not say. I took her to Mr. Etheridge's shop this morning, as she had told me she had bought a pennyworth of paper and an envelope there, to see if they (Mr. Etheridge, his wife, and daughter, who served the shop) knew her, and when there I said to her, where was the book, on the glass case or with those books (some that were together on the counter) you can tell me or leave it alone, it will neither make it better worse. She said, I took it off the glass case.

The prisoner had nothing to say in defence, and she was committed to the Sessions.

It appeared that she had also been committed on the Wednesday previous for stealing a memorandum book from Mr. John Mew's shop.


[TH: a certain Rebecca Smith also appears several times in County Sessions at Winchester charged with theft from various persons on the Island. The following tragic tale appeared next.]

An inquest was held at the Medina-inn, on the 17th inst., before F. Blake, Esq., coroner, on the body of a new-born female child.

Joseph Read, being sworn, said— I live in Quaystreet, Newport. Yesterday afternoon, about 3 o'clock, I was coming from the Grove into Newport. My attention was directed to something in the stream near Sea-street. I got it out, and found it was the body of a child—the body which has now been viewed by the jury. It was tied up in part of the lining of a gown, and part of a brick was also enclosed. It was tied in two knots, and pinned at the edges. The lining and brick are now produced. The brick was not near the head of the child. It was a female child. I observed a bruise on the fore head. It was near Mr. Hallett's coal wharf. I delivered the body to Mr. Cross, the landlord of the Medina inn, Newport. The brick was clear of the body, hung in the string the bundle.

Thomas Denness was next examined, and said— Yesterday afternoon, about one o'clock, I saw bundle tied up and pinned. It resembled the wrapper now produced. It was near the hatch of St. Cross' mill. That was about 300 yards from the place described by the last witness. I tried to reach it, and touched it with my foot. On my touching it, it fell over the hatch. It fell heavy. It was then high water. It must have fallen seven or eight feet—probably two feet of water when it fell.

Mr. Robert Horlock, surgeon, then said— I first saw the body of deceased about four o'clock yesterday afternoon. I examined the forehead and found it had a dark appearance, and there appeared to be extravasted blood beneath the scalp. The face was also a great deal discoloured. The left arm was lying across the upper part the chest, and the flesh of the arm quite flattened. An impression upon the chest where the arm had been lying across the body. The right arm in a flexed position. The umbilical cord had been divided close to the navel, apparently with an instrument, either scissors or a knife; but no ligature had been applied. A medical man or a midwife would have applied a ligature. The legs and thighs were also flexed and flattened. I think the body must have been tied up in the bundle while warm. There was eccleymosis of the blood-vessels on the arms and thighs, which prove that circulation had taken place after delivery. It was a full-grown female child. I should say that it had been dead more than a week—between a week and a fortnight. Decomposition had commenced on the surface. On turning the body over, I observed a good deal of crepitation under the left shoulder. I afterwards made an internal examination of the body. On opening the chest, I found the lungs and heart perfectly healthy. The vessels on the right of the heart, and the pulmonary vessels were much congested. The lungs appeared red and healthy; and on making an incision into the lungs, blood flowed. It crepitated to the touch. I have not the slightest doubt that the child was born alive. I put a portion of the lungs into water, and they floated. The stomach was perfectly empty. The child had never taken food. The bladder was also empty, which showed that the child must have passed water after its birth. I then removed the scalp; and underneath the scalp, on the right and upper side of the forehead, over the frontal bone, there was considerable quantity of extravasated blood. No extravasation under the other portion of the scalp. There is a membrane which covers the bone, (called the pericranium) and there was extravasated blood between that membrane and the bone. The place of the extravasation corresponded with the black appearance in the forehead; and I should think it was occasioned by a blow from a blunt instrument, as it did not cause any wound. On opening the head, I found the membrane of the brain a good deal congested, more particularly underneath the frontal bone, corresponding with the extravasation externally. That might have arisen from the same injury. The injuries which I found in the head, were sufficient to have caused death; and I consider they must have been inflicted while the child was alive. It was a very fine child, and I could find nothing to account for its death from natural causes. If the mother had been delivered while standing, and the child had fallen on a stone floor, it is possible, though not probable, that it may have sustained injuries such as I have described. The injury might have been occasioned either from heavy fall a hard floor, or from a blow from a blunt or flat instrument.

Verdict,— "The deceased was found dead, and that death was occasioned by injuries received on the head, but no sufficient evidence to shew whether the injuries were inflicted wilfully or accidentally."

NEWPORT PETTY SESSIONS. Saturday.—Before Rev. R. W. White (chairman), Sir John Simeon, Bart., Sir H. P. Gordon, Bart., the Hon. W. aCourt Holmes, and Capt. Kerr.

William Bagwell was charged with stealing a sovereign from the trowers pocket of Joseph Buckett.

It appeared that the complainant and the prisoner were "navvies" working together at West Cowes, lodged together, and occupied the same sleeping apartment. When the complainant went to bed on Thursday night last he left his purse in his trowsers pocket. It contained a sovereign, three half-crowns, two or three shillings, and four sixpences. In the course of Friday morning he had occasion to go to his purse, when he missed the sovereign. He went to bed before the prisoner, and did not hear the prisoner go. No one else slept in the same room.

Ellen Vine (a common prostitute) deposed to having been with the prisoner the next day at an eating house at Cowes, where he changed a sovereign.

Committed to the Sessions.

BOROUGH SESSIONS. Monday.—Before R. M. Wavell, Esq., E. Way, Esq., and Percy Scott, Esq.

George Downer was charged with using indecent language in the street. He did not appear. (Mr. Way being a witness in the case did not occupy his seat on the bench during its hearing.) P.C. Hobbs proved to having served the summons on Downer, and Mr. Way said—A few minutes before 9 o'clock on Saturday night, as I was going from my house into the High-street, I heard a great noise, and on getting near where it was I saw Downer pushing woman about and using very indecent language. I told him such language was not allowed to be used in the street, and if he did not home quietly I should find another place for him. He asked me who I was? I told him a magistrate of the borough, and that it was my duty not to allow such conduct. He then came towards me with the stick I now produce (about 36 inches long and 10 inches round) and threatened to strike me, and made use of similar language to me that he had been doing to the woman. I thought he would have struck me, but he did not. I fancied he had been drinking. I went away down the High-street to fetch a constable, and met Mr. Roach, who had heard what passed, coming with one.

P.S. Grapes said the defendant had been once before for assaulting the police.

A warrant was issued for his apprehension.

...

Honora Dunn was charged by Hannah Pursell with an assault.

The complainant said—I live in the Tontine yard. Am the wife of James Purcell, a labouring man. This woman's master, my husband, and myself, were coming down street last Monday evening, and she run again us in the street, and begun bating her husband for being in such bad characters as my husband and I was sir; and she kept on at him all up the yard until she came to her place, and I asked her if we was'nt good company enough for her husband; and she said, no. I asked her, why; because, she said, I was a whore. I told her to mind her words, sir, for I'd make her prove whether I was one; and she said, she would, I was a nasty drunken whore, sir. Mr. Hobbs here, was present sir and so was another gal, and heard the first and last of it.

Mr. Blake: Did she strike you?

Complainant: No, sir, she didn't strike me, but she called me a whore.

Mr. Blake: But you summoned her for an assault?

Complainant: Well, sir, she insulted me by calling me a whore.

Mr. Blake: But that is not an assault.

P.C. Hobbs said, no blows were struck, but there was a good deal of talking between them.

The magistrates recommended them to use better language towards each other, and live more peaceably as neighbours, and dismissed the case.

Abraham Rackett was charged by P.C. Lockhart with making a great noise in Quay Street, on Friday night, and disturbing the inhabitants. The prisoner said he was sorry for it, he had some drink in him. Fined 5s. and 5s. costs, and in default of payment was committed for 10 days.

NEWPORT PETTY SESSIONS.

Saturday.—Before Rev. R. W. White, chairman; Sir H. P. Gordon, Bart., Sir John Simeon, Bart., Hon. W. aCourt Holmes, and A. J. Hambrough.

George Lang and Charles King, the two privates of the 93rd regiment, who were remanded from Thursday last for breaking into the Riding School at Parkhurst barracks, and stealing therefrom several articles from the baggage which was stored away there, were again brought forward.

Richard Gough, color sergeant of the 77th depot, stationed at Parkhurst, was first examined, and said— I do not know either of the prisoners. Part of the articles now produced were my charge. On Tuesday morning last, having heard of a robbery being committed in the riding school at the barracks, I immediately went to see if any of the packages that were left in charge by Colonel Graham Egerton, of the 77th regiment, on his leaving England with the regiment for Constantinople, were disturbed. I found that a bed vellese had been opened and a buffalo's skin, a pair of blankets, bolster, two feather pillows, pilot jacket, and a polka cloak had been taken out of it. About the 17th ult. I had the vellese taken to my quarters to be aired. I saw it unpacked, and afterwards packed the things in myself. It was taken back to the riding school on the 23rd. It was fastened by buckles, and not locked. It was never opened at my quarters after I packed it. I know it was full when taken back to the riding school, because it took two men to carry it. The riding school is not locked during the day, but whether it is at night I am not aware. On the 24th I put my hand inside the package to see if the things were all right, and found that they were. On coming from church to the parade ground we had to pass through the riding school to get to the parade ground. When I came out of church last Sunday I turned round and looked at the vellese and saw that it was quite tight, and just as had previously left it. All the things I have mentioned, except the pilot jacket which is not here, are those now produced. I believe there were other packages broken open belonging to the 95th regiment, but I only had charge of those of the 93rd.

Elizabeth Sterrett, a common prostitute, living in the Tontine yard, Cosham-street, Newport, was next examined, and said—On Tuesday morning last, about half-past seven, the prisoner Charles King brought to my house a bundle tied or rolled up in something black like a coat or cloak. He said he found it, and asked me to let it stop at my house a bit. I said yes. He did not open it, nor did I. He took it upstairs into my bedroom. He came down stairs again, and remained there till the police constable came, about ten o'clock the same morning. He gave no account of where he got it. A girl from Portsmouth was having some breakfast with me when he came. I left them together in my house and went across the yard to the public house, and whilst there the policeman came and asked me if knew Charles King, and I said yes. He said, where is he. I said in my house. He asked me if he had brought a bundle. I said yes. I told him to go in and look for it. I told him to go up stairs. I went with him. King was in the house, concealed in the cupboard. The policeman brought down the bundle and opened it in my presence. There were four articles in it; a blanket, pillow, cloak, and pair of boots. I cannot swear that those now produced were the articles the policeman took away. I have not seen the prisoner Lang since somewhen last week. I saw King at the Tontine public house about seven or eight on Monday evening.

Jane Lock, another of those unfortunate girls, living in the same yard as the last witness, said— I know the prisoners. I saw King on Monday night. On Tuesday morning, about half-past seven, I saw him in the Tontine yard. I was in a neighbour's house the time. When I went into my own house, I saw some things there. It was about half-an-hour before I went to my own house. I did not see King away, or what become of him. When I went up stairs I saw a blanket and pillow had been put on my bed, and when I came down stairs again and looked in the cupboard, I found some wet shirts and a sheet. The blanket and pillow were laid loose on the bed as if they belonged to the bed. I am sure they were not there when I left the house. Just after I found these things my house King came in, and I asked him if he had brought the things and put them where I found them. He said, yes. I begged him to take them away. He said he would presently. He had nothing else with him. I then went out and King followed. I went across the yard. I returned in about ten minutes and found the pillow was gone. King was then in Elizabeth Sterritt's. I went into him and asked him if he had taken the pillow. He said, yes. I said to him, I wish you would come and take the rest away. He said he was going home bye-and-bye and he would take them with him. Whilst I was talking to Mrs. Sterritt P.C. Hobbs and the picquet came up the yard. The policeman took charge of the things and carried them away. I did not see anything of Lang.

P.C. Hobbs deposed to having gone with P.C. Purchase in search of the prisoner King, and to having found, at the witness Lock's house, four wet shirts, a wet sheet, and blanket, which he produced; and that he afterwards went to the barracks with Purchase, who took from Lang's foot a shoe and compared it with some footmarks in a garden adjoining the riding school, through which the prisoners must have passed with the things to get from the barracks unseen, and which marks corresponded exactly with Lang's shoe.

P.C. Purchase was next examined, and said— In consequence of information I received on Tuesday morning last, I went to the barracks and received from Sergeant Gough a list of some things that had been stolen. I then went into the riding school and through a door at the side leading into little garden, where I saw some footmarks. There was another door in the garden which led into the summer parade field. Some new buildings had been erected near the garden, and the clay from the foundation had been thrown into the garden which, being quite soft, made the footmarks very plain. There were the marks of the feet of two men in the direction of the field from the door. I got some stones and covered up some of the plainest of the tracks. I then went to the Sergeant Major and asked him if there were any men absent last night. He said, Charles was. I then came into Newport, and went into the Tontine yard with P.C. Hobbs—four soldiers came down with me. I went into the witness Sterritt's house and went up stairs, and received from her a blanket, a polka cloak, pair of boots, and a coat. She said, King had brought them there. I now produce the things. I then came down stairs and apprehended King; he was concealed in a cupboard. I told him I should take him into custody for stealing those things from the riding school. He said, then you'll take me for what I haven't done. As I was coming to the station house with him custody, I said him, how do you account for having those things in your possession? He said, I found them on the side of the road between the barracks and the toll-gate. I asked him, when? He said, last night, just after nine o'clock, when I was going to the barracks, just after the first tattoo, I picked them and brought them into the town; I was late, and I stopped absent.

From further information I received, I went to the barracks again in the afternoon with Hobbs. I went to Lang's quarters where he was, and told him I must have his shoes to compare with some footmarks. He took them off. I then went to the garden and compared them with the footmarks there, and they corresponded exactly. I now produce the shoes. I then went back to Lang's quarters and took him into custody. The buffalo skin and the other pillow were found in the field.

This being all the evidence there was against Lang the magistrates thought it insufficient, and discharged him.

Adam Mc'Pherson, sergeant of the 93rd Regiment, said— I know the prisoner King. I have known him for eight years. I was on duty on Monday night, and he was reported absent from tattoo. I remained on duty till Tuesday afternoon two o'clock; during which time he did not come to the barracks. On Sunday and Monday he was on duty as sentry at the riding school, which gave him an opportunity of seeing what was there. Sometimes the door of the riding school is not locked at night. During the night of the 29th ult., about twelve o'clock, the sentry at that post reported that some one had broken into the riding school. In consequence of which I went over, and discovered the side door which leads into the garden open. I saw the top partly off one box and the things in a ruffled state. That box belonged to the 77th Regiment. The baggage of five different Regiments was there. A box belonging to the 95th had also been disturbed.

The prisoner said, I am guilty of having the things, but not of taking them. I found them on the road-side. I never looked to see what they were; if I had known what they were, I would have had nothing to do with them.

Committed to the Sessions.

The prisoner was then charged with and committed for stealing the shirts from the washhouse at the barracks, they being identified by the woman who was washing them the day before.

Hampshire Advertiser - Saturday 15 July 1854

Closing of St. Thomas's Church.—

It is now positively arranged that next Sunday will be the last for holding Divine worship in our ancient parish church. Our feelings are indeed of a mingled character as we approach the solemn day. We cannot but hail with pleasure the prospect of having a new church in every way suited to the wants of the people. But it is impossible to contemplate the removal of the old fabric without many regrets. Built in the early part of the twelfth century. it has outlived many changes in our little town, and it will be long ere the eye is accustomed to the absence of one that has been the friend of many generations. On Sunday morning, the Mayor, Clergy, Magistrates, Councillors, and other officers of the Corporation, walk in procession to the church, when a sermon will be preached by the minister of St. Thomas, and a collection made in aid of the rebuilding fund. Sermons will be preached also and collections made after each of the other services. The Holy Communion will be administered in the evening, as the last solemn act of worship in the ancient fabric. Doubtless the scene will be an impressive and imposing one, and for years to come the closing day of the old parish church of Newport will be remembered as a memorable occasion in the recollection of the families of the Isle of Wight.

BOROUGH COURT. Monday.— Magistrates present: T. Cooke, and Edward Way, esqrs.

FEMALE JUVENILE DEPRAVITY.

Caroline Pierce and Ellen Pierce, two girls of the town, were charged with loitering in the High-street, on Wednesday night, at half-past twelve, for an improper purpose. Police-constable Hobbs said that he saw several girls there on the occasion, among whom were Caroline Pierce and, he believed, Ellen Pierce, but was not certain. He went towards the girls, when they passed through the Corn Market and stood under the Mechanics' Institution. He made towards them again, and they then moved towards the Green Dragon-yard. Caroline Pierce and another came back; the other girls went in different directions. He ordered them to go home, but instead of doing so, they went into the High-street. They were constantly in the High-street, and he had seen them speak to gentlemen, and go away with them. They were generally quiet, but the street swarms with girls of that description.— Police-constable Grapes said the girls were continually in the street at an improper hour.— Ellen said she was not in the High-street at all, and Caroline said she had been to a party at the Beehive, and only went into Cosham-street  with her companions, who lived there, and she was going home when she met police-constable Hobbs. It should never occur again, and she was very sorry it had now happened.— Mr. Cooke said he had no doubt but that Ellen was as profligate as her sister, and warned them and other girls in Court about strolling the streets at night.— Caroline was fined 10s, and 5s costs, which she paid immediately.

Joseph Anderson, of the Crab and Lobster publichouse, was charged with keeping his house open for the sale of beer after 10 o'clock on Sunday night, the 24th ult.

P.C. Lockhart said— I went to the defendant's house in company with P.C. Cave at twenty minutes to 11 on the night in question and heard persons in the house. I stopped at the front door and Cave went to the back door. Cave knocked at the back door and some one asked who it was, and he said, the police. The person did not open the door but went back again into the house. I heard a scuffle in the house afterwards. I rapped several times at the front door, and I heard the defendant say to a boy inside, Why don't you open the door or go and see who it is. A female made reply and said, you know who it is, it is the police. The defendant then came to the door and asked who it was. I told him, the police. He opened the door, and I asked him who he had in his house. He said, no one. I told him he had for I heard them. He again said he had no one; he would not do anything against the law if he knew it, for ever so. I went to the back door and let Cave in. We searched the house and found two men in a cupboard in the back room, two in the coal hole and in the yard, one the water closet. There were cups the sideboard that had been used for beer, and there was a quart cup and a glass half-full of beer in the other room. I told him I must report him. He said he hoped I should not.

In defence, Anderson said no beer had been drawn since ten minutes before 10 o'clock; but, of course, such an excuse would not satisfy the magistrates, and they fined him 20s. and 5s. costs.

Sarah Crib, an elderly woman, was charged with making use of obscene and indecent language in Brewhouse-yard, Sea-street, to Eliza Angel (a rather dark one.)

The complainant, on being sworn, said—On Thursday week Mrs. Crib and Jane Mc'Custom was having a few words to themselves in their door in Brewhouse-yard, and Mrs. Mc'Custom asked her what she meant by calling her a w————, and Mrs. Crib's daughter came out with a saucer full of tea and sop and threw it at Mrs. Mc'Custom's face. Mrs. Crib then turned round to me and said, you b————, I'll do for you. I had not spoken to her at all. I then asked her what she could do? and she said, you go and take that counterpane back to Mr. Mew's farm which I could swear you stole. I took one of the neighbours with me and went to Mr. Mew's. I asked Mrs. Mew if she could swear to the counterpane? and she said it was not her's. I asked Mrs. Crib to go with me, but she would not. When I came back I told her I had been, and she abused me shamefully. I did not go to her house at all. She called me other disgusting names. She did not strike me.

This disgusting evidence was confirmed by Mrs. Mc'Custom and Mrs. Whitmaich, and not denied by the defendant, but she said the complainant used as bad.

She was fined 5s. and 5s. costs, and if not paid in a week to be committed for 14 days.

BOROUGH COURT

MONDAY — Magistrates present: Dr. Wavell and Edward Way, esqrs.

SOLDIERS" SPREE.

Joseph Bailey, William Campbell, John Beadlestone, and Thomas Lyons, privates in the Sth Regiment, were charged with breaking into a house in Tontine-yard. (Most of the tenements in this den are inhabited by persons of ill-fame, and the general resort of the soldiery).

Elisabeth Sterrett said she lived in Tontine-yard, and was a widow. At about three o'clock in the morning on Sunday week she was in bed and heard a kicking at the door, and then heard a shutter broken open and one or two panes of glass break. When she had got a light four soldiers walked up to her room. Campbell was the first that came in. Beadlestone was another. She did not know the other two. Campbell said "Blood this night I'll have," and tried to tear her night clothes off her. Witness screeched "Murder!" and they went down stairs— she *threw* one down. Went down stairs and found four more— Lyons was one; did not know the other; they all got out through the window, and one of them said, "Campbell, smash some more windows," and they smashed several. There were eight panes broken—cost 8d a pane. Witness paid 8d for a bolt to fasten the shutters; the table was broken all to pieces, worth 4s. Witness did not miss anything, and they did not offer her any violence; she was only frightened. Campbell struck her before the officers, when she was picking them out.

Ann Philips said she lived in Tontine Yard; heard Sterrett call "murder," looked out of window and saw the soldiers break the window with a stick; saw they belonged to the 4th Regiment, did not know any of them, there were eight or nine.

P. C. Hobbs said that on the night of last Saturday week, he saw several soldiers come from Tontine Yard, proceeded there and saw the windows of Sterrett's house were broken. Knew Lyons and Campbell in the party, but could not identify the others.

Lyons, in defence, said he never was near the place.

Beadlestone said he was not in the streets— was not with this party all night.

Campbell was "not there at all at all."

Beadlestone called John Windgate, a private in the 8th, who said he was out of the barracks that night in a state of intoxication, and had been to sleep near a mill. When he awoke about daybreak he saw Beadlestone was there. Had not seen him before, and did not know where he had been in the night.

Bailey was discharged. The others were fined 10s and 3s 6d costs each, and, in default, committed to Winchester for one month.

Monday.— Before C. W. Estcourt, Esq., mayor; and E. Way, Esq.

Joseph Anderson, of the "Crab and Lobster" beer shop, was charged with keeping his house open for the sale of beer after the time allowed by law, and secreting soldiers at such times.

P.C. Cave, said — I went to defendant's house about half-past 11 o'clock on Monday night, the 19th of February, with the picket, in search of absent soldiers. I was admitted, and defendant's wife said no soldiers were there. Defendant was present. I went to the coal hole door and found it tied inside. I broke the string, and found a soldier concealed in the corner of the coal hole. I asked defendant and his wife if they had any more in the house, and they said, no. I then went up stairs and found two girls sitting by the fire, and two soldiers lying under the bed.

P.C. Hobbs, said—I went to the defendant's house with the picket, on the night of the 19th of February, at about half-past 10 o'clock, and found three soldiers in the kitchen. The picket took them away, and when they got to Nodehill they escaped from the picket. I went back to the house about half-past 11 o'clock with the last witness. P.C. Cave asked if there were absent soldiers there, and Mrs. Anderson denied that there were. We found one soldier tied in the coal hole, and two up stairs. They were the same three soldiers who had been taken from the house. On Sunday last, about 12 o'clock at night, I went to defendant's house, and saw a soldier in the kitchen. I asked the defendant's wife if there were any more. She said, no. I then went up stairs and found soldier bed with a common prostitute. There were two other prostitutes on the second floor, and two men with them. I believe one of the women was a lodger, but not the other women nor the men. I then came down stairs, and Mrs. Anderson let another soldier out of the back door. There are great complaints of the house from the neighbours.

The defendant was fined £2, and 5s. costs, and in default of payment committed to the house of correction for a month.

Isle of Wight Observer - Saturday 19 May 1855

BOROUGH SESSIONS. Monday.—Before C. W. Estcourt, Esq., mayor; E. Way, and W. M. Wavell, Esqrs.

Joseph Rands, shoemaker, was summoned by Rosa Jager for using profane and obscene language to her.

Mr. Beckingsale appeared for the defendant, and contended that the magistrates had no jurisdiction in the matter; for, even admitting that the language complained of had been used, it was in the defendant's own house, and neither the Act or the By-Law authorised them to interfere with any man for making use of such language in his own house.

The magistrates did not agree with Mr. Beckingsale that his arguments applied to the present case, as it occurred in the front shop, which was a public place, and it was not a private quarrel in the family.

The complainant then said—I am the wife of August Jager, a German. My husband works for Mr. Rands. Last Thursday week I took some work home to Mr. Rands' shop, and went in three times for the money. He said he had no change and could not pay me, and abused me. I told him my husband wanted the money.

Cross-examined by Mr. Beckingsale—I work with my husband at the trade. We have been making slippers for Mr. Rands. He only paid 6d. for making a pair of slippers. [Mr. Rands: I give them 3s. a dozen more than they get in London.] He did complain to them bout a pair being made bad, but how could he expect them made better for sixpence? He did not say he would not pay me till I got him the last my husband had that belonged to him. He said he had no change.

George Frederick Mills, a little boy, was then called by Mr. Beckingsale and stated that he was in the shop all three times when the complainant was there, and that Mr. Rands did not make use of any such language that mentioned the complainant. The case was then dismissed.

BOROUGH COURT

BOROUGH COURT. Monday.— Magistrates present: The Mayor (C. W. Estcourt), and R. M. Wavell. esqrs.

"Othello's Occupation Gone."— Joseph Anderson, the notorious occupier of the Crab and Lobster beer-shop (who is just out of Winchester Gaol), was again summoned, for "not being able to keep magistrates' hours," as he terms it.

Police-constable Hobbs stated that last Sunday week he went to the house of the defendant, at three o'clock in the afternoon, and found the front door open. There were between forty and fifty soldiers in the house, and some prostitutes; they were sitting about drinking beer. He went there with a piquet the other night, and they found six girls in bed.

Police constable Stubbs deposed that last Tuesday night, at half-past eleven, he caught about eight couple of men and women there. There were beer-cups on the table, and they were sitting down, listening to defendant singing, "John Anderson my Joe John." Stubbs remonstrated with him, and he merely remarked, that would make another charge against him.

Police-constable Cave proved the service of the summons. The man was not there, and his wife would not take it. She said her husband should not appear. He read the summons over, and put it down in the passage; he then left. She ran after him, and told him he might light his pipe with it, &c., throwing the summons after him.

Mr. Inspector Grapes recited several cases of previous conviction. He was called in Court, but no one answered, and the Mayor then adjudged the defendant to be fined £20, the license of the house to be cancelled, and himself to be disqualified for selling beer for two years. In default of payment of the fine, to be committed to Winchester Gaol for two months.

...

James Caffrey, a private in the 77th Regiment, servant to Philip Daucey, Esq., ensign, stationed at Parkhurst Garrison, was charged with stealing a coat, waistcoat, a gold enamelled ring, a gold pin, a set of gold shirt studs, set of coral studs set gold, a pair of gold and a pair of silver wrist studs, the property of his master.

Mr. Daucey, on being sworn, said —the prisoner was my servant and had access to my room and the charge of everything therein. On the 7th of May he left me, and after he had gone I looked over my things to see if anything had been taken, and I then missed the articles now named in the charge. They had all been taken from my drawer or from the mantle-piece. The drawer was not kept locked. I did not see any of the articles after I had missed them, until yesterday morning, when they were shown to me by the Sergeant of Police. The prisoner was absent from the barracks from Monday morning until the next Sunday morning, when he was brought in as a deserter. I can swear that the things now produced are those I lost.

Thomas Green, jun., chimney sweep at Newport, deposed to buying the coat of the prisoner for 2s. 6d. and an old coat.

Anne Jones, a common prostitute, living in Paradise-row, Newport, deposed to having received the ring from the prisoner and afterwards leaving it in the care of her landlady, Mrs. Leonard, who gave it up to the Police.

Elizabeth Pragnell, of the Oyster-shell houses, near Newport, said the prisoner came to her house in private clothes, with a girl, and asked to be allowed to stop there the night, which he did, and that he represented himself to belong to some ship about to be paid off at Portsmouth, and left with her the gold pin and studs for 15s., saying that he would take them again of her when he received his money.

P.S. Stannard then deposed to receiving the articles which he now produced of the several witnesses, and to taking the prisoner into custody. Committed to the sessions.

BOROUGH SESSIONS

Monday.—Before C. W. Estcourt, Esq., Mayor; and Dr. Wavell.

Joseph Anderson was charged with keeping his house (the Crab and Lobster beer shop, Deadman's-lane) open for the sale of beer on Sunday, the 13th inst., and on Tuesday night last, for the sale of beer at hours not allowed by the law, and for keeping very disorderly house. It having been proved by Mr. Grapes, inspector of police, that the defendant had been twice committed in this court for similar offences, he was fined and 7s. 6d. costs, and default of payment to be committed to the House of Correction, at Winchester, for a month, and to be disqualified from selling beer by retail for the space of two years next ensuing this conviction.

BOROUGH COURT. MONDAY.-Magistrates present: E. Way, R. M. Wavell. and F. Pittis, esqrs.

... William Hinds was charged with being unlawfully in the house of Joseph Guttridge, of Cosham-street. He said he felt something pressing on his chest, which awoke him in a fright, and he saw a man by his bed-side. He shouted "Holoa," and the stranger muttered something, but he could not tell what. He jumped out of bed, and rushed down stairs, intending to get a light, when he ran out and brought in a policeman, who found the man still in his bed-room. He appeared to be somewhat intoxicated. Complainant's door was not locked.

Police-constable William Lockhart deposed to complainant's running up to him with only his shirt on, and could hardly speak for fright. He said a man had got into his house. Witness went with him, when he found the defendant lying on the floor. He refused to go out, and witness pulled him out, when he began violently kicking. He was a militia man, and had taken his cap, coat, and belt off, and also placed a chair and table before the front door. In defence, the defendant said, "I had no intention of going to the house to do any harm. I had some drink, and did not know what I did."— He was fined 10s, and 5s costs.

P.C. Hobbs said—last night about o'clock I was on duty in the High-street, near the Bugle-inn, defendant was playing a violin and singing, and another man with him was playing a banjo. They were both on the pavement. Mr. Mew, the landlord of the Bugle came and requested me to remove them as they had dinner party who were very much annoyed by them. I spoke to defendant and requested him to go way. He said, "these gentlemen (pointing to three men in the Bugle') wish me to sing a song. I said, I had nothing to do with that and wished them to move on. Defendant looked to the men in the Bugle and asked them if they did not want him to sing a song. They made him no answer. Defendant began singing. I told him I should lock him up if he did sing, and he then went to the gentlemen and asked them to give him something. They said, you sing a song and I will. He then began singing and I took him into custody. In coming down the street he struck me with a fist and kicked me in my legs. He got his leg between mine and threw me. He pulled a quantity of hair out of my head with both his hands. He then got away. P.C. Lockhurst and I afterwards apprehended him in Cosham-street . He was very violent and kicked me. We were obliged to take his boots off and to get assistance to bring him to the Station-house.

A Batch of Disorderlies.— Edward Howes, the landlord of the Tontine, a notorious house in Cosham-street, was charged with assaulting Ellen Cribb, by striking her, making her nose bleed, and also tearing her clothes. He was fined 5s. and costs.

The last complainant's sister, who gave her name as Rosannah Oates, wife of a Serjeant of the 44th Regiment, preferred a similar charge against the defendant Howes. She admitted that she just stepped into the house with a soldier when a whole lot of them were fighting, and just after she had left, and had got into the middle of the road, the defendant came out and struck her. He accused her, too, of belonging to the opposite shop, and getting the soldiers away from his house to the "Red, White, and Blue." He was once more fined 5s. and 5s. costs.

The above two girls were now in their turn charged by the police with an offence against the bye-laws, by using obscene language on the occasion of the assaults above referred to, and were fined 5s. each, without costs, which they paid.

Two disreputable girls, named Jane Dyer and Georgiana Lush, were charged by the police with being in the streets at midnight with several officers of the Garrison, laughing, hallooing, and romping with them. They were committed to Winchester Gaol for a fortnight, as idle and disorderly persons.

NEWPORT. COUNTY PETTY SESSIONS.

BOROUGH PETTY SESSIONS. MONDAY, JULY 11th, (Before R. M. Wavell, and E. Way, Esqrs.)

Timothy Mahony was brought up under remand, charged with administering some deleterious drug to Elizabeth Hurst, Edith Parsons, and Elizabeth Jackman, prostitutes, at the "Old King's Arms." From the evidence of the girls, and of Susan Munday, a witness, it appeared that on the previous Tuesday evening the prisoner and a sailor went into the house where they found the complainants—that four quarts of beer were had in and paid for by the sailor—that the prisoner was seen to put some powder into the cup—to pour it into the glass and to return it to the cup. The girls were taken ill with similar symptoms within half-an-hour, and Robert Henkel, Esq., Surgeon, who was called, deposed that beer could not have the effects which he observed, and he had no doubt the symptoms were caused by some drug mixed in the ale.—Mr. G. P. Joyce appeared for the prisoner, and pressed for an adjournment, or justice would be denied to his client, as the assizes were then commenced, and there was not time to get up a defence.—Committed for trial at the assizes. The bill was ignored by the Grand Jury as far as poisoning was concerned, and one found for an assault, which Sergeant Chennell, who tried the prisoner, ruled was untenable,—he was therefore discharged.

BOROUGH POLICE COURT, TUESDAY, JULY (Before the Mayor and R. M. Wavell, Esq.)

Caroline Pierce and Caroline Sibley, two prostitutes, were charged by Lieut. Davey, of the 1st Royals, with stealing a carbuncle gold pin from his person, on Monday night, at the Rose and Crown. It appeared that the prisoners and prosecutor were in company, and one, if not both girls, sat on his knees. He missed the pin soon after, but did not see either of them take it, and it was not found.—The case was dismissed.

NEWPORT

ISLE OF WIGHT PETTY SESSIONS.

BOROUGH COURT. Monday.— Magistrates present: Dr. Wavell, and E. Way,

A serious charge of extensive drugging was last week preferred against an Irish coal-heaver, living in the Tontine yard, in this town, named Patrick Murphy, alias Timothy Mahoney, the particulars of which were miscarried last week. The case, however, was remanded to this day, for further evidence.

Elizabeth Hurst, a common prostitute, stated that she was in the tap-room of the Adam and Eve, in Pyle-street, on the previous Tuesday evening, when the prisoner and two other men came in, between eight and nine, and had two quarts of ale, to which they treated her and some other girls. On a third quart coming in, the prisoner put his hand into his pocket and pulled out some-thing which he threw into the cup, pouring out a glass full of ale, and re-mixing it; after which he put it to hie mouth, but did not appear to drink any, neither did the other men partake of it. He poured out glasses, and four out of the seven present partook of it, the same as they had from the former quarts; but the other three would not drink, because they said they thought he had put some-thing into it. He said he had not, and put some into his own mouth, but spat it out again, and laughed. Witness drank two glasses of that quart, and the prisoner went for another himself, and brought it in to the room, the waitress following him, saying she saw him shake something into it out of a paper. Witness found no difference in the taste of the beer, and partook of that likewise, as did also Edith Parsons, Elisabeth Jackman, and Sally Coster. The prisoner and other men soon after went away, laughing, and Coster threw the remainder of the beer away, because the other girls should drink no more of it. In a short time witness was seized with vomiting and diarrhoea, and such violent pains in the stomach that she was quite doubled up. Her body was also swollen, and her stays were obliged to be unlaced. Parsons and Jackman were also taken similarly ill about the same time, but Coster was not so bad, as she had only tasted a little of the beer. They were obliged to send for Dr. Horlock, who administered two draughts to each of them, and they ultimately got the better of it. Complainant said that she suffered most, as she drank more than the other girls — (she was too ill to stand in the box, and her eyes appeared swollen). Her throat, she said, was hot as fire when she vomited.

The prisoner here said that he only pretended to put something in the beer, saying to the men present, "See me have a lark with these girls," and it was that which frightened them.

The complainant positively assured the Bench she did see him put something into the cup, but he did it so quickly that she could not tell what it was; and, besides, he forced her to take the beer, holding one glass so tightly to her mouth that he would not take it away until he had made her swallow every drop.

Edith Parsons gave similar evidence. She discontinued drinking after receiving the caution from the waitress, and was shortly afterwards seized with the same illness as the last complainant.

The Court said this was a serious charge of administering some deleterious drug to these females, with the intent of inflicting bodily injury, and if proved against him, even if it was only a joke, it was a most cruel and dangerous one, and they must remand the case.

The matter was subsequently before the Court, and the prisoner was committed for trial at the Winchester Assizes, where, it will be seen by our report, the indictment was quashed, and the accused dismissed with a cautionary admonition. Under these circumstances, and in reference to the crowded state of our columns, we have omitted a portion of the report forwarded from Newport.

On Tuesday (before the Mayor, and R. M. Wavell, esq.), two of the elite of the Newport pave, named Caroline Pierce and Caroline Bartlett, were charged with feloniously stealing a gold pin from the person of William Davey, an ensign of the 1st Royal. It appeared that he and two other officers were in the bar of a public-house in the town, with half-a-dozen girls, about eleven o'clock the previous night, and no doubt some of them endeavoured to abstract the pin (which wad a valuable one— a carbuncle, with a gold twist round it.) from his scarf, as the two girls and himself were "very gracious" while there,— till he put his hand up to his "choker," and found the pin *non est.* when it was "all t'other." He did not, however, see them take it, and the police were sent for, who searched for it, but it could not be found; and it seemed foolish to bring the charges before the Magistrates, under such circumstances. Of course the girls were discharged.

HAMPSHIRE SUMMER ASSIZES

DRUGGING.

Timothy Mahoney was indicted for assaulting Elizabeth Hurst, at Newport, on the 8th July, and occasioning her actual bodily harm. Mr. Poulden for the prosecution and Mr. Cooke for the prisoner. Mr. Poulden, in opening the prosecution, said the case was of a peculiar nature, though the conduct of the prisoner amounted in law to an assault. The prisoner was in company with two or three girls of questionable character at the King's Arms public-house, in Pyle-street, Newport, the 8th instant. The prisoner went into the room where the girls were and drank some beer with them. He ordered two quarts of beer in succession, from which the girls, at his invitation, partook. He then ordered a third quart, but before any of this was drank, the prisoner was seen to put something into the cup and pour out a glassful of the liquor and put it back again. He did this several times in order to mix the substance put in the beer. He then again invited the girls to drink, and they did so, but complained of the beer having a nasty taste. The prisoner soon after left, and he had not been gone but very short time when the girls, especially Hurst, became exceedingly sick and ill, suffering from burning and swelling of the stomach and other symptoms beyond all doubt caused by some deleterious substance put into the beer.

Before the examination of witnesses, Mr. Cooke, on behalf of the prisoner, took an objection to the indictment, and cited cases in support of his argument that the offence, if proved, was not even an assault at common law. By the act of last session referring to the administration of chloroform and other stupifying preparations for the purposes of enabling a felony to be committed, the party so offending was adjudged guilty of felony. In this case the allegation was not that the drug was administered in order to commit a felony, and the offence was not a felony, neither did it become common assault. The objection was allowed to stand over till the facts of the case had been heard in evidence.

The prosecutrix Hurst being examined, said the prisoner tasted the beer of the third quart brought in, but spat it out again. She also added that he called in a fourth quart and took it behind the door, after which he held a glassfull of the liquor to her lips until she had drank the whole of it. The prisoner also just tasted the last quart of ale, but spat it out of his mouth and went away laughing. The waiter said the prisoner had put something in the beer, and told the girls not to drink any of it. The effects of the drink made the prosecutrix ill for two or three days. She was violently sick with burning in the throat and stomach, and her clothes were obliged to be loosed in consequence of her becoming much swollen. She said she saw the prisoner put something in the third quart, but she did not at the time suspect it was anything that would cause them harm.

In reference to the legal objection, the learned Sergeant said it was clear that the prosecutrix had confidence in the prisoner, and drunk the mixture voluntarily; and considering the cases referred to him by the counsel for the defence, he was of opinion that the conduct of the prisoner, although he had been guilty of a very wicked act, did not amount to an assault at common law. The Judge then directed the Jury to return a verdict of Not Guilty. The prisoner was then cautioned by the Judge as to his future conduct, and discharged from custody.

HAMPSHIRE ASSIZES

A NOVEL KIND OF ASSAULT.

Timothy Mahoney was indicted for assaulting Elizabeth Hurst, at Newport, on the evening of the 8th of July. Mr. Poulden prosecuted, and Mr. Cooke defended the prisoner. The facts of the case are as follows :—

The prosecutrix and some other girl, were at the King's Arms Inn, Pyle-street, Newport, on the above evening, where they met the prisoner, who asked them to have something to drink. Accordingly some beer was produced, and before the prisoner gave it to them to drink he was observed to put something into it, and the women who drank it, among them the prosecutrix, were shortly after their draught taken ill with vomiting and a burning kind of feeling in the throat and stomach.

Mr. Cooke objected that the case was not legally one of assault, and cited several cases in support of his objection.

The learned Serjeant agreed with Mr. Cooke, and said that it was not a case of assault at Common Law unless the intent of administering the drug or noxious composition was proved. It clearly did not come within the statute unless the prosecution were prepared to show that some coercion was used to compel the prosecutrix to take the liquor, he could not see how an indictment for assault could be maintained. It would be better, perhaps, to hear what the prosecutrix had to say.

The prosecutrix was called, and stated the case as above, also that no force was used to get them to drink.

The case was quashed, and the prisoner discharged with a suitable caution.

Lost in the Snow.— Severe cold weather suddenly set in here the latter end of last week, accompanied with a considerable fall of snow; and on Friday, Atwell, the Calborne postman, bad a narrow escape of perishing through its intensity. Not arriving with his mail-bag, which was due at Carisbrooke at six o'clock in the evening, Mr. Redstone, the Carisbrooke postmaster, and a neighbour named Jones, set off on the Calbourne road in search of him, and ultimately discovered him in a ditch, under a bank, benumbed, asleep with the cold, and covered with the drifting snow. He was conveyed home, and is recovering under the surgical aid of Mr. Tuttiett, surgeon.

ISLE OF WIGHT PETTY SESSIONS. COUNTY BENCH.

Saturday.— Magistrates present: Sir John Simeon, bart., Chairman, Captains Hamond, Crozier, and Duff, and Le Marchant Thomas, esq.

Charles Gosling, a private of the 96th depôt, stationed at Parkhurst Barracks, was charged by Colour Serjeant George Wolfe, the Pay Serjeant of the depot, with robbing him of a £5 note, a sovereign, and upwards of a pound principally in fourpenny-pieces. From his evidence, it appeared that the prisoner was employed by him as a kind of "batman" for general purposes. On Tuesday, the 25th instant, after taking from his box upwards of a pound to give a serjeant to pay some of his men, he locked the box containing the sum stolen in a bag, and secreted the key behind his looking-glass, when he left the barracks on leave for the night, the prisoner being in his quarters to do whatever was necessary; and when he returned the next morning be found the bag and money had been abstracted from the box. The prisoner had no liberty to go to the box.

In answer to questions from the prisoner, the prosecutor said he did not ask him for any money before he left the barracks, neither did he say "There's the bag in the box." He never entrusted him with the key, neither did he say "There's the key behind the box, you can take what yon like." All that he said to him before he went away was, that he had given out some crime papers to a Serjeant.

Serjeant Jobn Platt, of the 96th  depôt, stated that he was in the same room with the prosecutor, and on the evening in question saw the prisoner go to the box of Serjeant Wolfe, open it, and take something out. There was only a fire-light, but he did it openly. His wife told him she had seen him go there before, so he thought it was all right. They spoke a word or two to each other in a general way. He had seen the prisoner in town between four and five that afternoon. He had the key then, and told him he was going home to get some "tin." Witness thought Serjeant Wolfe had sent him.

Catherine Platt, wife of the last witness, also deposed to seeing the prisoner unlock the box, and take something out; she told her husband of the circumstance.

Cross-examined by the prisoner— Had seen money put there by the prosecutor. Did not see the prisoner take 5s out of a bag in the box, neither did she hear him make any remark about his doing so.

Timothy Donovan, a corporal of the 96th depôt, deposed to being in company with the prisoner at the Adam and Eve public-house, in Newport, on the night of the 26th of November. He ordered some porter, which he paid for in fourpenny-pieces, and said he had bought some boot-laces, and in pulling them out, he drew out at least half-a-dozen of fourpenny-pieces, which fell about the floor.

Elizabeth Hurst, a woman of loose character, stated that the prisoner was with her in the public-house in the evening, when he called for several quantities of porter and rum, which he paid for in fourpenny-pieces and sixpences. He left at "tattoo" time, and did not return till between ten and eleven, when he sat down by the side of another girl, named Parsons, and had some more rum. for which he gave a fourpenny-piece. They all after-wards went to her companion's lodgings, in Paradise-row, taking some rum with them.

Edith Parsons confirmed the last witness's statements.

Police-constable John Batley deposed that having received information of the robbery, and the prisoner having absconded from the barracks, he apprehended him in Newport on Thursday, and charged him with the robbery. He said he knew nothing of it, and inquired as to the amount missing. He told him upwards of £7. He replied, "That's all I want to know; all the money I had was from a serjeant, to pay some of his bills in town." Witness searched him, and found four fourpenny-pieces only on him.

This closing the evidence, the prisoner said in defence that he was sorry he had had any connexion with the man. He had been making away with the money, and now he had to settle up his accounts he wanted to saddle his defalcations on his back. Not a day passed that he took a pound from his box, and broke out of the barracks at night to spend it, and that was more than he could afford to spend. He certainly did take 5s out of the bag, and that was all; but the prosecutor had given him the key night after night. He had been fourteen years in the service, and was as innocent of intentionally defrauding as any gentleman on the Bench. They had not found the £5 note on him, and he should like the prosecutor to state what was the number of the note he said he had lost. After a short consultation, the Magistrates committed him to take his trial at the Assizes at Winchester, which commenced on Monday.

Isle of Wight Mercury - Saturday 20 December 1856

On Sunday, the 21st init., the new church of St. Thomas will be opened for Divine service, by license of the Lord Bishop of the diocese. The Rev. E. Mc All, Rector of Brighstone, and Rural Dean, will preach in the morning; the Rev. G. Prothero, of Whippingham, chaplain to Her Majesty, in the afternoon; and the Rev. G. H. Connor, M.A., Minister of St. Thomas's, in the evening. Great commendation is due to the Committee and all who have assisted in bringing this great work so near completion, as nothing but untiring zeal, great perseverance, much industry, and an indomitable determination to overcome difficulties could have succeeded in the vast undertaking. Newport has now a Metropolitan Church, worthy of the capital of the late of Wight, a pride and ornament to the borough, and a proof of the denoted attachment of the inhabitants to the church of their forefathers.

Isle of Wight Mercury - Saturday 24 January 1857

CONSECRATION THE CHURCH OF ST. THOMAS.

At an early hour, on Tuesday, January 20th, 1857, the streets of Newport were alive with eager faces; though, verily, "the dawn was overcast,"- and the rain descended in such torrents as might well have discouraged the good citzens of that "anciente towne" from venturing out to behold any spectacle less interesting than that which had called them forth. Ever memorable in its annals will be the said 20th of January. For the Consecration of a new Church is at all times an event of interest and significancy. As our Bridges and Railroads, our Hospitals, and Colleges, are the Landmarks of the moral and social progress of the Nation, so our Churches aree the Landmarks of its Religious History. The quaint, gray tower— the slender spire, are the characters by which a Christian people record their faith. And as the one rises above the leafiness of some quiet village, or the other soars above the busy streets of a crowded city, they become to the historian and the poet the materials which excite their research or stimulate their imagination. They link the Present with the past: they unite, by the eternal sympathy of a common faith, the worshippers of every age. Years move on: every annual revolution marking some change in the social life, the thoughts, and the desires of the masses: but Christianity, save in its external conditions., remains unaltered , and unalterable,— symbolized to every heart by the consecrated stones piled up by the men of the Past for the men of Today, or by the men of the Present for the men of the Future.

The Consecration of the Church of St. Thomas had, however, a peculiar interest. The gracefiul edifice which now does honour to the liberal feelings and artistic sympathies of the Isle of Wight, stands on the site of a venerable sanctuary hallowed by a thousand historical associations. The memory of a maiden scion of the illustrious, but ill-fated race of Stuart, rendered the old Church famous; the fine sympathy with misfortune and the discriminating love of Art which endear to all English hearts the name of Victoria— are indissolubly connected with the new Church of St. Thomas. This, while the Church of the Past shrined in its precincts the remains of the daughter of the Stuarts; the Church of the Present is adorned with her monument, raised to her by the best and brightest of the House of Brunswick, and the names of the Queen and the Captive shall be for ever associated with it.

It is not a matter of wonder, therefore, that the eyes of all true Christians, and those especially who recognise the dignity of Artwhen illustrating Religion, should have sedulously watched the progress of the building, as..

"strong and sure,  
With a firm and ample base,"...

it has gradually sprung upward, stone on stone, pillar after pillar, until in all its beautiful proportions it attests the genius of the Architect, and the loving faith of those who aided the noble work. No matter of wonder is it that it should have been thronghed with earnest worshippers when first the Word of God was preached within its walls. No matter for wonder is it that the solemn ceremony which is the *corona operis*— the crowning, as it were, of the work— the significant rite which proclaims to the world that, henceforth and for ever, these stones — this earth on which they are upgathered— this manifestation of Art hallowed by Devotion and encouraged by Benevolence— is dedicated unto God,—no matter for wonder is it, that is was witnessed by eager and by reverent thousands. And memorable, therefore, in the Annals of Newport will be to many a noble mind and pious heart that day on which the New Church of St. Thomas was solemnly consecrated to Religion.

The doors were opened at 10 o'clock,— the Service commeced at half-past 10. The Clergy assembled at the residence of the Incumbent of St. Thomas',— the Rev. G. H. Connor, M.A., and accompanied him to Church. We believe the following is an accurate list of those who were present:—
    
Rev. J. B. Atkinson, Cowes.  
Rev. T. Adkins, Southampton.  
Rev. Canon Blackburn, Yarmouth.  
Rev. E. D. Buttermer, Easton.  
Rev. E. Carr. Bonchurch.  
Rev. T. Cottle, Shalfleet.  
Rev. R. Dixon, Niton.  
Rev. —— Eiger, St. James', Newport.  
Rev. H. Ewbank, St. James'. Ryde.  
Rev. M. Geneste, West Cowes.  
Rev. Pellew Gaze, Brook.  
Rev. C. J. Garrard, St. John's, Ryde.  
Rev. D. I. Heath. Brading.  
Rev. E. V. Hennah, East Cowes.  
Rev. P. Hewett, Binstead.  
Rev. A. Hoare. Calbourne.  
Rev. —— Hodges.  
Rev. B. Isaacson, Freshwater.  
Rev. C. Livingstone, St. Lawrence.  
Rev. E. McAll, Rural Dean, Brighstone.  
Rev. J. Le Mesurier, Bembridge.  
Rev. H. Morris, St. Thomas's, Ryde.  
Rev. H. Haddock.  
Rev. J. Marland, Ventnor.  
Rev. G. Prothero, Whippingham. 
Rev. T. Ratcliffe, Godshill.  
Rev. T. Renwick, Shorwell.  
Rev. —— Spear.  
Rev. W. L. Sharpe, Barton Village.  
Rev. G. Southouse, Shanklin.  
Rev. S. Beaman, Northwood.  
Rev. W. Thomas, Sandown.  
Rev. C. W. Wilson, West Cowes.
Rev. Carus Wilson.  
Rev. A. J. Wade, Holy Trinity, Ryde.  
Rev. —— Wilkinson.  
Rev. E. Venables.

The Right Rev. the Lord Bishop of Winchester was received at the door of the Church by the Worshipful the Chancellor of the Diocese; the Rural  Dean, (Rev. E. McAll); the Vicar of Carisbrooke, (Rev. E. D. scott); by the Minister and Curate of St. Thomas', the Clergy, Churchwardens, &c.

At this moment, the spectacle was one peculliarly interesting. The crowded Church, the clergy in their robes, the solemn strains of the organ, the dimly-lighted interior, offered points worthy of a poet's skill.

The procession having advanced up the central aisle, the Bishop seated himself on the right side of the altar, his Chaplain on the left. HE then said: "I am ready to consecrate their Church according to the form of the English Church." The ceremonials prescribed for such an occasion were duly observed. It is obvious that it would be impossible in our columns to give them in detail. The Registrar having read the Petition of the Inhabitants for the Consecration of the Church, the Bishop said,—"You will registeer thissentence, and preserve it in the Registry."

The Morning Service was then read most impressively by the Rev. G. H. Connor, M.A., and the Lessons by the Rev. E. D. Scott. M.A.. Vicar of Carisbrooke.

CONSECRATION OF ST. THOMAS'S CHURCH.

A day long anticipated by a great proportion of the inhabitants of this town and its vicinity has at length arrived; many labours and more anxieties have had their reward. Local perseverance, and general benevolence,— royal munificence, and the widow's mite,— have united to rear in our Island capital an edifice worthy of the place it occupies, and of the purposes for which it is designed. The New Church of St. Thomas has been thrown open for the accommodation of our townsmen, and was officially dedicated to its holy purposes on Tuesday last, the 20th instant, by the Right Rev. the Lord Bishop of Winchester.

The Bishop entered the church at a few minutes after eleven o'clock, where he was met by the Rev. E. McAll, Rural Dean, the Rev. E. D. Scott, Vicar of the Parish, and the Ministers of the Church,— the Revs. G. H. Connor, and J. S. Wilkinson, and, we believe, the whole of the Clergy of the Island, with the exception of one gentlemen, who was obliged to leave home, but who sent in his stead a liberal contribution to the building-fund. The Corporation had already taken their places in the handsome and commodious seats allotted to them. The Worshipful the Chancellor of the Diocese, Dr. Sumner, read the deed of consecration.

The ceremony was conducted by his lordship with his invariable impressiveness of manner, by which he so greatly adds to the solemnity of such services; and it was a sight though but seldom seen, yet long to be remembered. An overflowing congregation were assembled, who manifested the greatest interest in the proceedings. Our space will not allow a detailed account of this day's ceremonies, and we regret more than we can express that an unusually large amount of important local news compels us to condense our report on this subject into so small a space.

After the more immediate service of consecration was performed, the usual morning service was commenced, ...

BOROUGH PETTY SESSIONS. (Monday. Dec. 29.—Before Edward Way, and j. H. Hearn, Esqrs.)

Female Debauchery.

A woman named Elizabeth Jackman, a prostitute, was brought up in custody, charged with being drunk in the public streets at midnight, on the previous Friday. The case was proved by PC. Stubbs, who stated that on Friday night, about half-past 12 o'clock, he saw the defendant in Paradise-row, and also in Pyle-street, in a state of intoxication. He desired her to go to her home, which was situate in Paradise-row, but she requested that she might be locked up. He again repeated the salutary advice to go home, but, after walking down Pyle-street, she returned to the officer a second time, and in accordance with her request, locked her up in the station-house.

The girl expressed contrition for her conduct, and, after duly admonishing her, the bench ordered her to be discharged.

BOROUGH PETTY SESSIONS. [Monday.— Before R. M. Wavell, and E. Scott, Esqrs.]

Felony.— Sarah Duffy, a woman of low character and depraved habits, was charged with stealing a piece of pork, of the value of two shillings and five pence, the property of William Lane, a labouring man residing at Arreton. It appears that the silly fellow had been drinking with the prisoner the "Tontine Tap" till midnight on Saturday last, and had with him a basket provisions for home, including a choice bit of pork for Sunday's dinner. When the tap was closed and they could get no more beer, he went with the fascinating Mistress Duffy — whose blandishments and charms he could not resist — to her house up the Tontine yard, and she had not much difficulty in persuading him to go back and try to get a pint of beer, and whilst he was gone she opened the lid of his basket, looked at the pork, approved both quantity and quality, and so took it to herself. When the unsuspecting William returned, both she and the pork were gone. He shouted at the foot of the stairs, but nobody answered, and so he went and informed the police; and the next day, P.C. Stubbs, in presence of Superintendent Stubbs, found the identical piece of pork concealed in her bed. Committed to one month's hard labour.

The Half-crown Trick.— A juggler, who gave his name as James Rowan, was charged by Mr. Andrew Attrill with filching him of a half-crown. It appeared that the defendant was in the Trooper public-house, conjuring, and borrowed half a-crown of the plaintiff, with which to perform some tricks. He gave him back what he conceived to be the identical half-crown, which he put into his fob, where were three other half-crowns and smaller silver. Soon after, during his performances, he accused the plaintiff of having a halfpenny of his in his waistcoat pocket, which the unsuspecting Mr. Attrill denied. He was, however, persuaded to look, and, lo! there was the very halfpenny! This was considered by the company to be such an admirable trick, that they gathered a few more "browns" for the man, and he walked off. Sometime after, the plaintiff discovered his loss The prisoner was committed for seven days' hard labour, as a rogue and vagabond.

A Juvenile Thief.— A girl, 10 years of age, named Georgina Ann Parsons, was charged with stealing a mantle from the pawnbroker's shop of Mr. Wells, in Cosham-street. and after-wards pawning it at Mr. Whitcomb's.

The case was dismissed.

M. WOODMORE v. W. GUMMON, 6th Regt.

Mary Woodmore, sworn— I am a single woman. I live in Scarrets-lane. Last Wednesday morning between 10 and 11 o'clock, I was at home in bed. I heard some one breaking open shutters. I got out of bed and looked out of the window, and saw it was the defendant. I asked what he wanted. He said he wanted to come in. I told him to go away. Between 11 and 12 on the same morning of the same day, I was in the Tontine Inn, Defendant came in and asked Eliza West who was there and who lives with me, and what she said. She said that we did not want him up there. He then struck her with his open hand in the face. I asked him why he did it. He then up with his fist and gave me a black eye. He afterwards said, "take care or I'll give you more." He would have struck me again but he was prevented by Corporal Cox.

Cross-examined— Defendant did strike me, and tore my hat off my head.

John Chick, sworn— I live in Scarrot's-lane, and I was at the Tontine last Wednesday evening before defendant came in. He asked Eliza West what she had been saying about him, and struck her.

Borough Petty Sessions, July— Before the Worshipful the Mayor (in the chair), R. M. Wavell, and E. Way, Esqrs.

Henry Underwood was charged with assaulting George Coward.

Coward, sworn— I was coming up St. James-street last night, at 20 minutes to 11 o'clock, when this young man came across the road and struck me in the mouth. A person of the name of Salter was with him. They knocked me down and kicked me in the back. The defendant gave no reason for it.

Inspector G. Grapes, sworn— At 20 minutes to 11 o'clock, Coward came to me and said he had been knocked down. I went to Mr. Homan's comer and saw the policeman, who told me that Underwood was the person who struck the prisoner. He was the worse for liquor.

P.C. Linnington, sworn—I was at the Waggon and Horses, in Crocker-street. I heard a noise at the corner, and Coward came up and said that this young man had struck him. He came up at the time and struck him again in the face. He was not very drunk, nor very sober.

Cross examined by defendant— When Coward came up to me you came and struck him.

Defence— There was a scuffle, and I went across the road and my hat was knocked off. I did not strike him.

Fined 10s. and costs, or in default one month at Winchester.

Henry Underwood was charged with assaulting Elizabeth Jackman.

Elizabeth Jackman, sworn— Last night, at 20 minutes past 11 o'clock, I had been for a walk and was coming home. I was with George Coward and Sarah Cosier. I saw this man strike a young woman named Duffey, and I asked him why he did it. He made no answer, but struck me directly on the forehead with his fist.

Sarah Coster, sworn— I was in company with Elizabeth Jackman. I saw the defendant strike a girl named Duffey. She had said nothing to him. He first threw a stone at her and made her nose bleed. He then struck me on the side of my head. I told him I'd call the police. I saw him strike Elizabeth Jackman on the forehead.

Defence— I did not strike either of the girls.

Fined 10s., and the costs of the court.

BOROUGH COURT. Monday— Magistrates present: The Mayor, R. M. Wavell, and E. Way, esqrs.

George Coward charged Henry Underwood with striking him several times on Sunday night last, in Crocker-street. It appears he and others were drinking, and there were several skirmishes, and complainant, who was the least to blame, got most of the blows. Defendant declared he did not strike him at all, but P.C. Limington swore he struck him in bis presence, and he was fined 15s, including costs, which he paid.

The defendant, Henry Underwood, was now charged with striking three prostitutes, named Elizabeth Jackman, Ann Duffey, and Sarah Cosier. It appeared Coward was with them, and this caused the ill-feeling. He was mulcted in another 15s, which he also paid.

Borough Court, Monday— Before the Mayor, R. M. Wavell and E. W;ty, Esqrs.

John Chick, a German, was charged with keeping a disorderly house and encouraging prostitution therein. P.C. Stubbs proved that on Sunday morning, the 6th inst., he went to the defendant's beershop, in the High-street, about quarter-past one, when he found in the parlour three of the band of the Limerick Militia, a serjeant, and a civilian. In the passage he found another civilian, lying drunk on the floor with a common prostitute by his side. In one bed-room which the landlady unlocked he found two civilians and two prostitutes, in another bed-room one civilian and one prostitute, two civilians in another room, and another prostitute down stairs, most of whom were well supplied with beer. Defendant said he went to bed at eleven o'clock, and knew nothing about the matter. The Court said his conduct had been disgraceful, and they should fine him in the penalty of 3l. and costs, cautioning him that if he ever came there again he would not be let off so easily.

Hampshire Independent - Saturday 27 August 1859

Early Depravity

George James (15), was charged with a similar offence.

P.C. Stubbs examined: On Thursday morning, about half-past one o'clock, I found the prisoner lying dead drunk and asleep in the road in Cosham-street. His mother (a fish woman), had sent him to Ventnor in the morning with shrimps for sale, and he was to bring her home 10s., but he had only half-a-crown left when I found him, having spent the rest with the girls. 

The Mayor was sorry to see a youth taking to such a disgraceful course of conduct at his early time of life, but for his mother's sake, he would discharge him this time, if he would take care not to come there again.

The prisoners pleaded not guilty.—The Court discharged Moore, and sentenced Crayford to one month's imprisonment, with hard labor.

The Bench thought there was not sufficient evidence to convict, and dismissed the case.

Isle of Wight Observer - Saturday 12 December 1868

FRIENDLESS AND FALLEN.

To the Editor of the Isle of Wight Observer.

Sir, —The influence happily exercised by the English press giving publicity to the operations of benevolent enterprises induces me to solicit your aid in pleading the cause of an institution designed to afford the relief so urgently needed for the unhappy victims of immorality. The public are already too well acquainted with one phase of this wide-spread and melancholy evil: a glance at every public thoroughfare at once acquaints the observer with it. Such a view, however, gives but a very imperfect representation all that involved in a life prostitution. The fallen woman is there recognised under circumstances which naturally excite but little sympathy. To be seen in her true state —when the woman is herself again—it is necessary to visit her in her miserable abode, which is seldom without some valued relic serving to remind her of the time when she was virtuous and happy, and to which she clings amid all her misery and wretchedness. It is then that hollowness and shame of the life of so-called gaiety is seen, as the unhappy victim of sin, shorn of her finery and false appearance, realises her position as an outcast! When the fever of excitement is lulled, and the calmness of solitude enforces reflection, I say she then realises her misery, and I speak advisedly. Few can understand the suffering an immoral life entails. Seven years is its average length, and into its brief span crowded painful and distressing experience. Fully seventy per cent, of the unhappy creatures who crowd our streets have suffered their first fall through the wiles of the betrayers, thus losing their characters and their means of livelihood through one false step. Abandoned in their fall, without friend or counsellor, they have descended grade by grade until they reached the lowest depth in the social scale. These poor victims of a sinful life have experienced trials which would excite pity in the hardest heart, could all their sufferings be told. Many are supporting illegitimate children out of the wage of unchasteness, whose morality they carefully watch over. It must not be supposed that the majority fell into the condition of outcasts without struggling to regain their former position of respectability. Many have been domestic servants, needlewomen, &c., and the cry that is continually heard is, "Who will now employ me without a character?" "Now that I have fallen, who will receive me?" Many a poor girl cast out to struggle upon the streets for the want of a helping hand to aid in restoring her. The London Female Preventive and Reformatory Institution has laboured in full view of all the distressing incidents which a mission to the fallen can only reveal, and the promoters of the institution are impressed with the importance of further efforts for the rescue of this unhappy class of our fellow-creatures. Now, sir, the institution whose claims upon the sympathy of the benevolent public, with your permission, I fain would urge, has been instrumental in aiding no less than 2,6O5 friendless and fallen women since its establishment in 1857, and the committee rejoice that the liberality of the subscribers has thus enabled them not only to effect the moral restitution of the majority of that number, but also to eliminate from society such a large proportion of painful and destructive an element. The institution now supports seven distinct homes, the particulars and operations which are contained in a detailed report, which will be most gladly forwarded to any taking an interest the subject, or who would like to inspect the homes. At the opening of the present year the committee, having funds at their disposal, authorised the admission (on any day) of friendless and fallen females anxious to reform; they also determined (seeing how many unhappy victims are inveigled from foreign countries) to extend the benefits of the institution to all fitting applicants, irrespective of birth or creed, thus enlarging the basis of their operations, and limiting it only by the amount of funds placed at their disposal. During the present year 430 poor creatures have been admitted, and have partaken of the shelter of the homes; of that number 285 were fallen, and 145 were friendless young women. Unhappily, *five hundred applicants* had to be *refused* for want of means to provide further accommodation. When all the homes are full, no less than 3,000 meals per week have to be provided for the support of the inmates. And in order to meet these and other necessary expenses, the committee are entirely dependent upon the voluntary, and often daily, contributions of the benevolent public. Aided by the experience gained in past operations, the committee have carefully arranged the working of each home. Five are devoted to the reception of fallen women only, one for those who have never fallen from the path of virtue, and another for the reception of convalescent young women of good character leaving hospitals and asylums. To secure a discriminate selection from the applications in the latter ease, a qualified female attends the various hospitals, &c., in order to seek the most suitable candidates for admission. In addition to the above, the committee have established a Night Reception House (admitting neither tramps nor vagrants), the doors of which remain open *all night* to receive the fallen women weary of a life of so much suffering and reproach, the only qualification necessary being proof of a desire to forsake the sinful course. In this asylum, Christianlike and genial, though severely plain, of necessity it must be, 450 of the "fallen" gladly took temporary shelter, were lodged, fed, conversed with, and then referred to homes, or places of refuge for penitent and suffering humanity. It known that one-half of these have been arrested in their miserable career and saved from moral and spiritual destruction. Of the inmates of the homes generally, many are restored to their friends, others undergo a training which qualifies them for domestic or other service; many are assisted to emigrate, and all brought under the influence Godly instruction, in which the Gospel of salvation is placed plainly before them. And now, sir, our *funds are exhausted*, and an account of our stewardship ready to be rendered. The cold blasts of wintry nights are sending us importunate applicants who, in sorrow and contrition, plead for shelter and relief. Must they be *rejected*, "and find no place of repentance, though they seek it carefully and with tears?" I would again appeal to the rich to spare of their abundance to relieve the great cry of suffering which goes up to heaven from the stricken hearts of poor perishing "fallen" women. I would appeal to those in humble circumstances to give a mite, even in their poverty, to this blessed work, for from many a cottage home throughout the land has the poor girl come, who has been betrayed and cast out in this great city. Those who are neutral, both in possessions and sentiment towards this mission, I entreat to "come over and help us", that we may not mock with cold and hollow sympathy, destitute of the means necessary to provide relief and rescue, the many who so earnestly seek reclamation.

I am, Sir, your obedient servant,

E. W. THOMAS, Sed.  
200, Euston-road, London, N.W.

ISLE OF WIGHT

Death of Sir Francis Pittis.—

Sir Francis Pittis, J.P., of Newport, died at his residence, Newport House, on Sunday afternoon, about half past one o'clock. He had been confined to his bed for some two or three weeks, and daring the latter part of last week his illness became serious. Dr. Groves was last week called in to consult with the deceased gentleman's physician. Dr. Allan Waterworth, but medical skill was powerless to avert the approaching close of life. Paralysis set in Friday, and the end was expected that night, but a slight improvement was manifest on Saturday. On Sunday morning, however, there was a relapse, and at the hour stated Sir Francis Pittis breathed his last, passing away at the age of 77 years. Sir Francis Pittis's death marks the removal of one of the few remaining men of note who have taken active and a leading part in the public affairs Newport and the Isle Wight during the last half-century. In his earlier years he was the proprietor of an important upholstery, auctioneering, and valuing business in the Market-square, but for many years past the firm has been widely known as that of Mesers. Francis Pittis and Son. He soon became marked as a public man, and has long occupied a seat in the Council chamber either as Councillor, Alderman, or Mayor. Eight times he had been elected to the civic chair, the last being 1887, when he received the honour of a knighthood. He possessed a commanding voice and power of speech, combined with strong personality, which placed him above his fellows. Although a Conservative and Churchman he never allowed political proclivities or religious views to clash with the discharge of his public duty, and in him the borough had a zealous guardian of its ancient rights and privileges. As a politician he held the leadership of his party in Newport for a long period, and he has always commanded a strong influence throughout the Isle of Wight. He had been a member of the School Board from its formation, and was Chairman of the Charity Trustees. He possessed a robust constitution, but of late years the ailments of age have taken possession of him, Although they have not interfered with his public duties any great extent. Sir Francis, who married a sister the late Mr. Henry Wells, Kingsgate-street, Winchester, leaves two daughters and a son —Mrs. Waterworth, wife of Dr. T. Waterworth, Miss Pittis, and Mr. Councillor Pittis. The funeral took place yesterday at noon.

TO DO

THE LATE SIR FRANCIS PITTIS.

At St. Thomas's Church, Newport, on Sunday morning last, the prayers of the congregation were desired "for Francis Pittis." It was known that for some days Sir Francis had been in a critical condition, but it was not thought that the end was so near. About half-past one on Sunday afternoon he breathed his last. His illness was not of long duration, and knowing his strength of constitution and the longevity of some members of his family—his mother died at the patriarchal age of 90—the hope was cherished to the last that we should see him amongst us again. With his son-in-law, Dr. T. Waterworth, and Dr. Allan Waterworth in constant attendance, and with Dr. Groves in consultation, all that medical skill could do was done, and all the care that love could suggest was lavished upon him; but death was inexorable, and the end came as we have said, faced with calm faith and compassed with peace. By the death of Sir Francis, Newport loses its foremost citizen. For the extent of a whole generation his name has been prominently associated with the public life of the borough, and he served the town with an ardour and a devotion which will not soon be forgotten. When William Baron Mew, Robert Pinnock, and Francis Pittis sat at the same table as Aldermen of the Corporation of Newport, that body possessed three members who, in point of business capacity and high personal character, could not be surpassed in any municipality in the country. "All, all are gone, the old familiar faces."

Alderman Sir Francis Pittis, J.P., who was in his 78th year, was a native of Newport, and was descended of a very ancient and honourable Isle of Wight family. One of his ancestors —the Rev. Thomas Pittis D. D.—was in 1683 rector of Gatcombe and Chaplain in ordinary to His Majesty King Charles the Second, and another ancestor was, some two centuries ago, vicar of Brading. Members of the family were buried at Niton, in the parish church of which place there are tablets to their memory. Other members were buried at Whippingham, and when the church there was rebuilt, the inscribed stones were removed and braes plates with similar inscriptions were placed near the spot, in front of the pew occupied by Her Majesty the Queen. Sir Francis was educated at a school at Newport—a very large private establishment, which was located in fine premises in Quay-street, since pulled down. The school was under the patronage of Queen Victoria's father, the Duke of Kent, whose name it bore, and it was for many years conducted by the Abbé De Grenthe, and afterwards by Mr. Alexander Clarke, an uncle of Sir Francis. His connection with the Corporation of Newport extended over a period of about 40 years, but he was actively identified with public matters in the town before he entered the Council. He was first elected to the Mayoralty in 1852, and he was re-elected in 1853. This year was rendered memorable by the visit of the late Prince Consort to the town for the purpose of laying the foundation stone of the parish church —the stately edifice of which the inhabitants of Newport are so justly proud. As Mayor of the borough it fell to Sir Francis to receive and entertain His Royal Highness, and the dignified manner in which he represented the town on that occasion won universal admiration. In 1859, 1861, and 1862 Sir Francis was again elected to the chief civic office, and it was during the last of these three Mayoralties that another notable event occurred—the marriage of the Prince of Wales. With Sir Francis at its head, Newport right loyally did honour to the occasion. It will be remembered that on the day of their marriage the Prince and Princess came to Osborne, and the Mayor and Corporation, who had proceeded by water to Cowes in State barges, presented an address to their Royal Highnesses on their landing at Trinity Wharf, East Cowes. In 1877 Sir Francis was elected to the Mayoral office for the sixth time, and he was re-elected in 1878. It was at the close of hie seventh term of office that it was resolved that the great services of Sir Francis to the town called for public recognition. and a testimonial fund was started, to which all classes of the inhabitants, as well as many friends outside the borough, contributed; and on March 14, 1880, in the presence of a large representative assembly, a splendid painting of a Hampshire scene, by George Cole, was presented to him, together with an address embodying the sentiments of esteem and of gratitude which animated the donors.

TO DO

         We now come to the crowning event in the long and honoured public career of Sir Francis Pittis. By the Queen's desire, the celebration of the Jubilee of Her Majesty's reign was arranged to take place in 1887, and towards the close of 1886 the question was raised in Newport, as in other boroughs, who should be the Jubilee Mayor? In Newport there was no difficulty in arriving at a choice. Everybody felt that, by virtue of age, experience, service, it was most fitting that the Mayoralty in so auspicious and memorable a year should be held by the then "Mr." Alderman Francis Pittis. We gave repeated expressions to this feeling at the time, as did also our contributor "Stylus," whose words we quote now because of the prophetic touch that there was about them. In our issue of November 6, 1886, "Stylus'wrote: "The Mayoralty, it is understood, is placed entirely at the disposal of Mr. Alderman Pittis, who is in every way deserving of the proffered honour. I trust that he will accept it, and that before the year has run its course I may have the inexpressible happiness of greeting him as 'Sir Francis. Our contributor, alike with us all, Kul that happiness. Although feeling the pressure of advancing age, Mr. Alderman Pittis readily placed himself at the service of the Corporation and of the borough, and on the 9th of November, 1886, he was elected Mayor of Newport for the eighth time unanimously elected, South and North rising together and blending their acclamations. In the course of the . . speech 'in which he acknowledged the honour he said "He could have wished, indeed, that their choice had fallen on a younger man, for when one's age had advanced beyond three score years and ten, he naturally looked for some repose, but, tbank God! if he had not so much physical activity as he had years ago, his head, he was glad to believe, was right, and his heart was still the same, inclining him to do all in his power to promote the well-being and the prosperity of his native borough." Here we have expressed that which was always a ruling motive with Sir Francis Pittis—an anxious desire to do the best ho could for the town of his birth. With what marvellous energy and enthusiasm—very marvellous indeed, considering his years Newport's Jubilee Mayor entered into the arrangements for fittingly celebrating the year's event our readers will readily remember. Newport came out grandly. Who that saw it is likely to forget the magnificent scene which the town presented on that 22nd of July when the Queen visited the town and received an address at the hands of the Mayor! It was in Her Majesty's reply to this address that she gave utterance to words which the people of Newport should treasure and which ought to have been printed in gold and placed within the Council Chamber of the borough: "The interest which my dear husband took in the welfare of your town," said the Queen, "has always been shared by me, and I pray that the prosperity which has attended you for the last fifty years may continue, and that the happiness of your fellow.citizens may increase for the remainder of my reign." From the first it was the strong desire of the then Mayor that Newport should possess some p ermanent memorial of the Jubilee —" something, as he once remarked, "which shall tell those who come after us of the sentiments of loyalty and devotion to the Throne which animated their ancestors in the year of the Victorian Jubilee." How he clung to this ideahow persistently he pushed forward the construction of the Jubilee clock tower, how at length he saw it accomplished, and how munificently he cleared off a deficit on the fund--our local records tell. On the morning of August 9, 1887, the Mayor received an intimation from the Prime Minister that the Queen had been pleased to confer on him the honour of knighthood. How the town received this gracious news ass reflected in our columns at the time. "As the intelligence became known congratulations poured in upon 


TO DO

his worship, in the course of the day the bells of St. Thomas's Church rang jubilant peals, flags were displayed in various parts of the town, and the one theme of absorbing conversation was the distinction with which the Queen had been pleased to crown the career of one of the worthiest and most honoured citizens of Newport." On the • 12th of August the Mayor went to Osborne, and was there knighted by the Queen. The distinction never had a worthier recipient, but Sir Francis disclaimed any personal title to it, preferring to regard it as an honour done, through him, to Newport. The Queen afterwards conferred the Jubilee decoration upon him. The connection of Sir Francis Pittis with the Council terminated only with his life. He was present at the last monthly meeting, sitting in his accustomed place on the right of the Mayor, and he joined in the discussion of several questions which came before the meeting. It will be impossible to fill the blank in the Corporation which the death of Sir Francis has occasioned, because there are none left who possess the vast amount of experience which he in the course of his long public life had accumulated. The interests of Newport always lay very near to his heart, and whenever a voice has been necessary to be heard in their defence, he has spoken with a voice that , none have surpassed. Proud of its history, jealous of its honour, and solicitous for its welfare, he served Newport in his day and generation with conspicuous devotion, and its roll of citizens bears no more honoured name. Sir Francis filled many other public positions. He was the senior member of the Newport borough Bench, and here, again, his long experiewe, added to • sound judgment, lent great weight to his opinion. Taking a deep interest in education, Sir Francis was a member of the first Newport School Board, and his connection with it was maintained up to the time of his death. He was chairman of the Charity Trustees, and by his decease the old Grammar School of Newport, to the foundation of which one of his ancestors munificently contributed, loses one of its best and staunchest friends. He was also chairman of the Burial Board, chairman of the committee of the Art Class, senior trustee of the Blue School, and a member of the commit-I tee of the National Schools. In politics he was • thorough-going Conservative, and had been for many years recognised as one of the leaders of the party in the Isle of Wight. With him loyalty to the Throne and to the Constitution was a passion, and the prayer for "the safety, honour, and welfare of our Sovereign and her dominion'," was with him not an utterance of the lips merely, but • fervent aspiration of the heart. Possessing a commanding voice, • manly presence, and marked power of utterance, he was years ago one of the most effective political speakers in the Isle of Wight, and he had always the courage of his convictions. Those convictions were strong, and so oociudonally were the words in which they were expressed—too strong sometimes for his oppo- I wets, but while the latter might differ from the views enunciated, they always respected the consistency of the speaker. And this consistency was undeviatingly characteristic of Sir Francis Pittis. What he believed to be right he inflexibly pursued, in shine or shade, and in this respect, as well as in his integrity of purpose, his rectitude of conduct, and his devotion to duty, he has left us of to-day and those who shall take our places in the days to come an example which we and they will do well to strive worthily to follow. As we have said, Sir Francis had reached the age of TT. His wife pre-deceased him in 1878. He leaves one son—Mr. Councillor Francis Pittis, J.P.,—and two daughters, one of whom, Miss Pittis, so gracefully performed the duties of Mayoress in the Jubilee year. The intelligence that Sir Francis had passed away bee generally known throughout the , town on Sunday afternoon, and regret and sympathy were everywhere expressed--regret at the loss of so honoured and eminently useful a citizen, and sympathy with the members of the bereaved family in their sorrow. At St. Thomas's church, on Sunday evening, the Rev. R. R. Percent, in closing his sermon, said since they met there that morning one had passed away full of faith and years, who deserved pre-eminently well of that place. From his work here we knew that he had been called into the safe-keeping of a lov. iog and most just Father. We knew, too, that for those who were in sorrow now there was the consolation that the Saviour could give, with the assurance that He is the resurrection and the life. And, he thought, that where there was any appreciation of devotion to duty, of consistent adherence to principle, and of inflexible integrity of life, the memory of him who had been taken from our midst that day would be retained and cherished. At the close of the sermon the hymn "O, let him whose morrow" was sung, and Mr. Scadding, presiding at the organ, played the "Dead March" in Sax!, the whole congregation standing. At the Mission Hall service the same evening, the Rev. Mr. Burton, before the prayer for all sorts and condition of men, asked for the prayers of the Church on behalf of the family of the late Sir Francis Pittis, and at the commencement of hie sermon the Doctor said that only that morning they prayed for "Francis Pittis" in church, and they now prayed for those survivors who so sorely needed their sympathy. He believed that the whole of Newport sympathised with them that one and all were as men "mourning when their leaders fall." Sir Francis had been a great man in that town. He had been eight times Mayor, and was foremost in every good work, notably that of the building of the parish church. He was the last of those whose names were engraved upon the foundation stone —great names placed there in no spirit of selfish arrogance, but simply as setting forth the true history of how nobly they had striven and would strive majorem Del gloriant. That was neither the time nor the place to attempt to sum up all that Sir Francis Pittis had done for Newport. It would be sufficient to say that his record was a clean and noble one. He had left a stimulus and a bright example to the youth of that town, and withal a very encouraging example, showing how • strict adherence to truth and duty would bring • man to eminence during his life time, with "peace at the last," when that well-spent life was over. The lesson seemed to be summed up in those grand words of the Poet Laureate" Not once or twice to our fair 161A1.1 'dory, The path of duty was the way to glory; He, that ever following her commando., oon with toil of heart and knees .usl hands, Through the long gorge to the far light has won Hilo path upward, and low:sailed, Shall find the toppling crags of Duty scaled Are close upon the shining tablelands To which our (led Himself is moon and sun." —The St. Thomas's Men's Bible Class, and also I the Women's Bible Class, have sent letters of sympathy, signed by the members, to the family of the late Sir Francis. At the Wesleyan Chapel on Sunday evening, the Rev. George Wood, the officiating minister, prayed that the members of the family might receive consolation in the hour of their bereavement. He also prayed that the town might take to heart the lesson of the event of that day—that however life may be filled with the business of this world, however distinguished h in station, however influential upon others, and however protracted in its duration, the end must come and that one event happeneth to all. The Rev. W. B. Lark, at the Bible Christian Chapel 1 the same evening, in the course of an address to young men on "Manliness," referred to the death of Sir Francis Pittis, whom he held up as an example of unswerving integrity and of faithful and unshaken adherence to the principles which in his heart he believed to be right. In the prayer which followed Mr. Lark commended the bereaved to the Comforter, whose divine solace in such times of sorrow was the only effectual consolation.
