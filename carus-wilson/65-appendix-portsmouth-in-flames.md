PORTSMOUTH IN FLAMES!!!

STOP, friend, for a moment, and do not run away with a wrong impression.

The towers of your churches still stand aloft; the buildings of your town, both great and small, are still intact; a wonder of wonders indeed, never to be thought of but with the greatest thankfulness. I know not a greater wonder, than that with all the combustible materials of our crowded towns, and all the carelessness of numbers of their inhabitants-drunkards with candles, for instance, and folks going carelessly to sleep with lights near their beds, etc., etc.-yet that we wake morning after morning without ever dreaming of the cry of fire disturbing our repose.

If any one doubts the reality of an over-ruling Providence, I think he may learn his lesson here.

No; I refer not to the raging element which has just laid a flourishing town in America in ashes-it is not this which creates alarm and would prompt the warning to the inhabitants of Portsmouth, and implore them to escape for their lives-but it is the flames of sin which may be seen advancing in all directions, laying waste the dearest interests of immortal beings.

Now think not that the people of Portsmouth are regarded as sinners above all men because we thus speak. God knows that iniquity abounds in all directions; yet no one can be conversant with the state of this town, and duly reflect on its moral condition, without feeling his spirit stirred within him to attempt every practical means of stemming the torrent of iniquity.

Portsmouth, no doubt, labours under peculiar disadvantages in a moral point of view. The prevalence of soldiers and sailors-the constantly fluctuating population -all this must have its hurtful influence; and no wonder that respectable families are driven into safer quarters, from the impossibility that increases of keeping their households from evil contamination. But let not the soldier and the sailor have more laid to their door than belongs to them. I know it is the fashion to charge on their evil influence the demoralization of a town like Portsmouth. But they are greatly wronged. There are, no doubt, and always will be, sad exceptions; but there is a mass of moral, yes, and religious influence both in army and navy, which only wants encouraging, and to be met with every advantage for its exercise rather than the contrary. A new regiment may come into the town, full of riotous, thoughtless young fellows; but would it not make all the difference in the world, whether they come and find the net laid for them at every corner, and snares and temptations abounding in all directions, or the reverse?

The ship may be paid off, and Jack may come on shore flush of money, and in a state of thoughtless bewilderment; but it will make all the difference in the world whether he comes to fall into the jaws of the abominable sharks waiting for their prey, or under the guidance and direction of those who would promote the good of both body and soul.

Here is the grand mischief. The soldier and the sailor may say, "No man careth for my soul." They come and find the town alive for their ruin-every one greedy of his prey. Human ingenuity taxed to the utmost to entice, and allure, and destroy. Here, then, is Portsmouth in flames. I was pondering over its sad condition, with its population, I suppose, of scarcely less than 80,000 souls, and I could not help saying to myself, "It is like a city on fire. What can be done?" Oh, my reader, something must be done to arrest the flames. The warning must be echoed forth in all direction— "Escape, escape, flee for your lives."

I. Now let us just for a moment consider the fact that here is a town in flames.

II. I should then like to point out to you those in Portsmouth who are busily engaged in putting faggots on the fire, and adding fuel to the flames.

III. And having done this, I should like to say a word about those who are doing all they can to put out the fire.

Now, first, for the fact. Do you think the figure does not apply? The Bible gives us a key to this matter. It compares sin to a fire with reference to a point which may seem comparatively trifling. "Behold (says St. James), how great a matter a little fire kindleth! And the tongue is a fire, a world of iniquity; so is the tongue among our members, that it defileth the whole body, and setteth on fire the course of nature; and it is set on fire of hell." (James iii, 5, 6.)

Does the Apostle say all this of the tongue? Oh, think of the amount of profane oaths and obscene words, the filthy conversation of the wicked, the wrath, the anger, the quarrelling, the backbiting, all the dirt, and filth, and abomination which hundreds and thousands of tongues are issuing forth day after day, and night after night, from the beginning of the year even to the end of it; blackening and disgracing the men and women who are thus guilty, and like the eruptions of Mount Etna and Vesuvius, pouring forth their streams of fire, and laying waste and destroying in all directions.

But if the tongue is a fire, is it the only one? Sin, sin, in all its evil workings, is a fire, a world of iniquity. The drunkard sets himself on fire, inflames his passions, primes himself for mischief; the fornicator, the whore-monger, the unclean person, he is in flames indeed! So of covetousness, and every other sin which a man allows; it is a fire, a world of iniquity; a flame consuming his very vitals, burning up all his dearest interests! And it is set on fire of hell! What a thought! The fire of sin is the beginning of hell-fire! It is a torch lighted in hell and brought by devils into the world, to kindle a kindred flame amongst poor thoughtless sinners!

Oh, this is sin-your sin! It is the fire of hell begun on earth. Oh, will ye not flee for your lives? Oh, have done with sin for ever. Iniquity will most assuredly be your ruin.

2. But are there any who are actually laying faggots on the fire? I see a poor young man taking his place in the gin-palace, and he is a self-sacrifice. He reminds me of the poor Hindoo widow, who, in her devotions, goes and lays herself on the pile of her deceased husband, there to be burnt to death. Poor young man! Oh, that I could reach every such poor young man before he seals his doom. Stop, stop, before you venture to set foot in the gin-palace. It is the threshold of the brothel; often of the gaol, It is set on fire of hell. Oh, stop, stop, before you further go. Will you madly rush into hell flames? Oh, be not a self-sacrifice. All may be bright, and specious, and alluring; and you may be strong in your resolves not to go beyond a certain point, but to stop in time; but the rolling stone once let down the hill is hard to stop. The further it goes, the less possible to stop it. Oh, keep out of hell's influence, if you would not be engulphed in its flames for ever.

But I am speaking of those who lay the faggots on the fire.

Now I would not wrong a human being if I could help it, nor push a thought beyond its truth. Why should I? What end would it answer? But in thinking over these matters I was very painfully impressed with the conviction, that the brewers and distillers are like men who are preparing the fire and heaping up the faggots to set the town in flames. The whole system is rotten and indefensible, and where the consciences of these men are I cannot tell; or how they expect to compose themselves on a dying pillow, or to stand in the judgment-day.

I speak not of the manufacture of the liquid fire; that is a distinct question. I only speak of the abominable and outrageous system which universally prevails, of spreading the flames as widely as possible. A man may argue that the manufacture of liquors is necessary; I touch not this point at present; but will he say that it is necessary for anything but his own pocket, that he should have his regular map of the town, and his eye on all the new streets and buildings, as vigilantly as the tax-gatherer or surveyor-for what purpose? Why that he may open his gin-palaces and beer-houses as largely and thickly as possible, and thus carry on with the greatest success the traffic of soul-destruction, and do his utmost, at least, to set the town, morally in flames. Was there ever such an agent from hell! This is indeed to open a Tophet with a vengeance. "He hath made it deep and large: the pile thereof is fire and much wood." (Isa. xxx. 33.) And perhaps the brewer is a magistrate, invested with the power of granting licences for these furnaces of liquid fire. If there is no pity for immortal souls, and the love of gain is the only ruling passion, what must be the natural and inevitable consequences of such a state of things?

I know there are brewers and distillers who are beginning to tremble at the prospect of their future reckoning. I cannot fancy any who will have a larger crowd around them of wretched reproachers. It is sending souls to hell by wholesale. Would that I could get access to every brewer in Portsmouth, aye, throughout the United Kingdom, and "ask him to say deliberately whether the system of extending beer and gin shops without the least view to their necessity, but only to the increase of gain, utterly regardless of the ruin of men's best interests for both worlds, is what they dare to justify, or can hope to give a good account of to the Judge of quick and dead. I have lately met with an interesting instance of one who feels that he must at once abandon his unchristian traffic for ever.

Judges, recorders, chaplains of gaols, lawyers, all grades best capable of forming a correct judgment, all bear testimony to the rapid progress of demoralization and ruin throughout the land as traceable to drunkenness. And this the brewers and distillers originate and advance! The Maine Law is sweeping like a mighty torrent over the States of America, with an irresistible force, and completely transforming the face of society in many parts. It is slowly, but surely, making its way in England, and the time must come when public opinion must prevail with Parliament to step into the breach. Several Members of Parliament are only waiting to advocate the Maine Law in the House of Commons, till the country is sufficiently enlightened on the subject, and prepared to give an adequate support. In the meanwhile I pray that many in this fearful position may be roused to see their danger, and abandon their post without delay.

And who else are laying on the faggots? Emphatically and pre-eminently the retailers in the gin and beer shops,

​What a spectacle is here presented! I resolved for once to see for myself. In going from the railway station to Portsea I passed a gin-palace splendidly lighted up. Young women behind the counter were giving out the liquors. The front was crowded chiefly with poor fallen girls. I opened the door on the right, and saw a large room crowded with young men and women, drinking, smoking, etc.

And here is a scene that may be witnessed every night and in every part of Portsmouth; hundreds of gin-palaces, these strongholds of Satan, set on fire of hell! Men and women heaped as faggots, on the fire, fuel for the burning, regardless of all their interests in life, and all their prospects for eternity! If one of those wholesale soul-destroyers could have the history of his victims for the past ten or twenty years set before him, could he stand it? Would he not sink into the very dust, incapable of enduring his feelings? But the sight will come, and the reckoning will be made; and, oh, the wailings and gnashings of teeth, when lost souls crowd around the soul-murderer in hell! Who can dwell with the devouring fire? Who can dwell with ever-burnings?

O ye who lead others into sin, stop and consider. Ye who have found your way to the gin-palace and brothel, stop before you take that young fellow with you. Oh, lay not more faggots on the fire, You have found the way of transgressors hard. It has not been all sweet to your taste. There is the wormwood and the gall. Ah, many and many a one amongst you would have given worlds never to have begun the life of sin.

Then have pity upon others. At all events, pause before you make another as much a child of hell as yourself.

Oh, resolve not to put one faggot more on the fire.

3. But is there nothing doing to quench these flames? Are all hands engaged in heaping on the faggots? Ah, there are those who sigh and cry for the abominations that prevail in their town. They hear the cry of-fire and they see the flames fast ascending, and they are doing all they can to arrest the mischief.

The ministers of the gospel have this aim; the Sunday School teachers are busily at work in the same direction: tract distributors (and blessed be God there is a company of forty banded together for this express object), they are labouring to take faggots off the fire and to prevent their increase. And think not, I pray you, that the soldiers are only the pest and curse of your society and the tempters to sin. There is many a brave fellow who is as hearty in his allegiance to the King of kings, as he is devoted to his Queen. Yes, I know numbers in your town, who have been rescued as brands from the burning; and have forsaken the ways of sin, and found Jesus and his great salvation to be so precious to themselves, that they are longing to get every comrade and friend into the like happiness. Oh, that you could hear the earnest supplications and prayers of many a one amongst them, that the blessed Jesus will extend to other poor sinners the same mercy that they have found. Yes, thank God, there is many a brave soldier's hand stretched forth to rescue faggots from the flames in Portsmouth.

Now, what I want, in conclusion, is to stir up all who have found the evil of sin, and the preciousness of a Saviour for themselves, to remember that Christ says, "Ye are the light of the world." Ah, dear friends, I very much doubt whether, with all our doings, we are as wise and active as the children of darkness. The devil is always going about seeking whom he may devour. And he has most active, willing agents here on earth. Those breweries and distilleries never stand still. Cross when one will to Gosport in the floating bridge, if there is a cart on board, it is the brewer's liquid fire going from one part to another, like the gas pipes to light up its flames. No, the brewer and distillers never lose their opportunities and opening; and the gin-palaces exercise untiring ingenuity with their splendid lights and other attractions to beguile and ruin. And the music and the dancing, and the low theatres, and the brothels, -was there ever such a machinery of busy industry for setting Portsmouth in flames. But shall we be outd one by them? What! when we have the great Captain of our salvation at hand to guide and strengthen and help us? when we have the assurance that He must reign, that He hath put all enemies under his feet, that His are the kingdoms, that he is the stronger than the strong man armed, and that He is waiting to see of the travail of his soul in the conversion of poor' sinners!

Oh, dear friends, up and be doing. I appeal to all who have found Christ for themselves. I say again, "Ye are the light of the world." Christ expects souls to be enlightened by his light reflected through you. Oh if every one did but consider this obligation! I speak not to ministers, I scarcely speak to those who are giving their evenings to tract-distribution, but I specially speak to those who have found Christ, but as yet have not come into the vineyard of active work for him, a yet, have not thought of the duty of doing their utmost to put out the fire. Dear fellow Christians in the Army and Navy! oh, resolve not to hide your talents in a napkin, or put your candle under a bushel any longer. Begin the new year with holy resolves. Redeem the time. Very soon the night will come upon us when no man can work. can work. Lay yourselves out to do good to others, to check sin, to frown upon an oath, to lead all you can around you to their Bible, to their knees, to their Saviour, to heaven.

And there is not one Christian in Portsmouth, be his station ever so humble or his means ever so limited, who may not do something towards putting out the fire. Why have we not amongst our most useful tract-distributors, one who has always a good word ready for any one, the wife of a poor labouring man, with a family of children to attend to, and who yet, without neglecting them, finds time to attend to the raging fire?

Oh, if all who have learnt more excellent ways would but bestir themselves to do good to others, what might we not live to see? I affectionately appeal with all the earnestness of which I am capable to all who love the Lord Jesus Christ in Portsmouth, and implore you to come to the help of the Lord against the mighty. Try to stop the poor victims entering the gin-palaces.

Have a tender, solemn word, and a suitable tract for the fallen female. Ah, it is not all solid mirth; there is many a heart as heavy as lead; many a poor creature who, if taken by the hand, would gladly forsake her evil I know it. I do not speak at random.

Warn the young men. Be instant in season and out of season. One immortal soul saved will amply repay a life of effort. But how many may be given for your hire! And above all, be much in prayer for the Holy Spirit. We are wholly dependent on his influences. It is ours to work, it is His to bless. Oh, what we want is more of the life-giving power of the Spirit, softening hard hearts, opening blind eyes, and thus enabling poor sinners to see their danger, and understand a Saviour's love. Resolve throughout the new year to be more than ever in prayer for the Divine Spirit. When together in social prayer, in your private devotions, make this prominent: that the Holy Spirit may come in showers of blessings; sanctifying and beautifying with salvation more largely the little flock of Christ, and more and more adding to that flock such as shall be saved. Aim at the best and most extended machinery for good in the midst of your vast population; but be earnest in prayer for enlarged spiritual influence, without which all will be useless.

If Portsmouth is like Moses' bush in flames but not consumed, it is because of the ten righteous that are therein. "Ye are the salt of the earth.” As such, be it yours to put forth more and more of a beneficial influence.

Dear friends, I commend you to God and to the Word of His grace.

"Be ye stedfast, unmoveable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, forasmuch as ye know that your labour is not in vain in the Lord.”
