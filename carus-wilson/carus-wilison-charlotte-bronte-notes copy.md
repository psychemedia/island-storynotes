Jane Eyre - Lowood, Mr Brocklehurst

According to [BBC Bitesize revision notes](https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/guides/zsrktyc/revision/8):

> Mr Brocklehurst, a clergyman, is the supervisor of Lowood School. He is mean, vindictive and enjoys making the girls quiver in his presence. He enjoys the power he has and enjoys doling out punishments.
>
> Brocklehurst wants the pupils of Lowood School to be modest and pious and he cruelly restricts their food rations. This is hypocritical, as his family enjoys very fine things and is not deprived of anything.
