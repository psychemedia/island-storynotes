# Following the Libel Case

With an apology accepted regarding a claimed unintended libel, and a defense made by the prosecution in that case that steps were already being taken to address concerns raised in the contentious tracts, were any changes apparent in terms of reduced cases of licentious behaviour making their way through the courts?

Perhaps the first thing to note is that in the week following the libel case, Carus Wilson's tracts were still being advertised.

It appeared that he and two other officers were in the bar of a public-house in the town, with half-a-dozen girls, about eleven o'clock the previous night, and no doubt some of them endeavoured to abstract the pin (which wad a valuable one— a carbuncle, with a gold twist round it.) from his scarf, as the two girls and himself were "very gracious" while there,— till he put his hand up to his "choker," and found the pin *non est.* when it was "all t'other." He did not, however, see them take it, and the police were sent for, who searched for it, but it could not be found; and it seemed foolish to bring the charges before the Magistrates, under such circumstances. Of course the girls were discharged.

BOROUGH COURT. On Monday, before Dr. Wavell and E. Way, Esq.

"SHE WAS SITCH A SCREAMER!"

Caroline Pierce, Sarah Harvey, and Mary Ann Groundsell, three veiled young ladies, standing in class A 1 on the pave, were charged with being common disturbers of the peace.

P.C. Grey examined: Last Wednesday night, about a quarter to eleven, I was standing in front of the Market House, when I heard some disgraceful screeching and screaming in the Corn Market. I went in that direction, when I saw these women standing under the portico of the Newport Arms. One of them said, "Here comes the policeman," and then they turned about, and went in to the Newport Arms, and I went in and saw who they were. They were not sober, either of them, and there was no one else in the market, or in the house. They are common prostitutes.

Inspector Grapes examined: The inhabitants of the Corn Market are frequently making complaints of the nuisance created by these girls at late hours, and one of them has been committed for it, but it is of no use talking to them. These offences recur frequently, and on this occasion, you could hear their screams clear down to the Market House.

Defendants said they were not intoxicated, and that they never screamed. They were only enjoying a laugh together.

The Chairman: We are sorry to see young people brought before as on such disgraceful charges as these, and there is no doubt but you are frequently intoxicated. Your conduct is a nuisance to the town, and we shall now bind you over in the sum of £10 each, for your good behaviour for three months.

Defendants paid the fees of 5s. each, and were liberated, somewhat astonished at having escaped so easily, after having given the required bail.

Whilst many of the reports paint a picture of women perhaps of a rather a hard character, able to hold their own in a fight as well as an argument, rarer reports also show how precarious their position could be.

BOROUGH PETTY SESSIONS. MONDAY, JULY 11th, (Before R. M. Wavell, and E. Way, Esqrs.)

Timothy Mahony was brought up under remand, charged with administering some deleterious drug to Elizabeth Hurst, Edith Parsons, and Elizabeth Jackman, prostitutes, at the "Old King's Arms." From the evidence of the girls, and of Susan Munday, a witness, it appeared that on the previous Tuesday evening the prisoner and a sailor went into the house where they found the complainants—that four quarts of beer were had in and paid for by the sailor—that the prisoner was seen to put some powder into the cup—to pour it into the glass and to return it to the cup. The girls were taken ill with similar symptoms within half-an-hour, and Robert Henkel, Esq., Surgeon, who was called, deposed that beer could not have the effects which he observed, and he had no doubt the symptoms were caused by some drug mixed in the ale.—Mr. G. P. Joyce appeared for the prisoner, and pressed for an adjournment, or justice would be denied to his client, as the assizes were then commenced, and there was not time to get up a defence.—Committed for trial at the assizes. The bill was ignored by the Grand Jury as far as poisoning was concerned, and one found for an assault, which Sergeant Chennell, who tried the prisoner, ruled was untenable,—he was therefore discharged.

The report in the *Hampshire Advertiser* seems rather garbled, locating the tale in the *Adam and Eve*; but it does add some colour regarding the accused, describing him as *"an Irish coal-heaver, living in the Tontine yard"*, as well as reporting some of the claimed dialogue— *"see me have a lark with these girls"*.

NEWPORT

ISLE OF WIGHT PETTY SESSIONS.

BOROUGH COURT. Monday.— Magistrates present: Dr. Wavell, and E. Way,

A serious charge of extensive drugging was last week preferred against an Irish coal-heaver, living in the Tontine yard, in this town, named Patrick Murphy, alias Timothy Mahoney, the particulars of which were miscarried last week. The case, however, was remanded to this day, for further evidence.

Elizabeth Hurst, a common prostitute, stated that she was in the tap-room of the Adam and Eve, in Pyle-street, on the previous Tuesday evening, when the prisoner and two other men came in, between eight and nine, and had two quarts of ale, to which they treated her and some other girls. On a third quart coming in, the prisoner put his hand into his pocket and pulled out some-thing which he threw into the cup, pouring out a glass full of ale, and re-mixing it; after which he put it to hie mouth, but did not appear to drink any, neither did the other men partake of it. He poured out glasses, and four out of the seven present partook of it, the same as they had from the former quarts; but the other three would not drink, because they said they thought he had put some-thing into it. He said he had not, and put some into his own mouth, but spat it out again, and laughed. Witness drank two glasses of that quart, and the prisoner went for another himself, and brought it in to the room, the waitress following him, saying she saw him shake something into it out of a paper. Witness found no difference in the taste of the beer, and partook of that likewise, as did also Edith Parsons, Elisabeth Jackman, and Sally Coster. The prisoner and other men soon after went away, laughing, and Coster threw the remainder of the beer away, because the other girls should drink no more of it. In a short time witness was seized with vomiting and diarrhoea, and such violent pains in the stomach that she was quite doubled up. Her body was also swollen, and her stays were obliged to be unlaced. Parsons and Jackman were also taken similarly ill about the same time, but Coster was not so bad, as she had only tasted a little of the beer. They were obliged to send for Dr. Horlock, who administered two draughts to each of them, and they ultimately got the better of it. Complainant said that she suffered most, as she drank more than the other girls — (she was too ill to stand in the box, and her eyes appeared swollen). Her throat, she said, was hot as fire when she vomited.

The prisoner here said that he only pretended to put something in the beer, saying to the men present, "See me have a lark with these girls," and it was that which frightened them.

The complainant positively assured the Bench she did see him put something into the cup, but he did it so quickly that she could not tell what it was; and, besides, he forced her to take the beer, holding one glass so tightly to her mouth that he would not take it away until he had made her swallow every drop.

Edith Parsons gave similar evidence. She discontinued drinking after receiving the caution from the waitress, and was shortly afterwards seized with the same illness as the last complainant.

The Court said this was a serious charge of administering some deleterious drug to these females, with the intent of inflicting bodily injury, and if proved against him, even if it was only a joke, it was a most cruel and dangerous one, and they must remand the case.

The matter was subsequently before the Court, and the prisoner was committed for trial at the Winchester Assizes, where, it will be seen by our report, the indictment was quashed, and the accused dismissed with a cautionary admonition. Under these circumstances, and in reference to the crowded state of our columns, we have omitted a portion of the report forwarded from Newport.

```

When transferred to the Summer Assizes, a technical defense appears to have been made, that the claimed offence *"was not an assault at common law"*.

HAMPSHIRE SUMMER ASSIZES

DRUGGING.

Timothy Mahoney was indicted for assaulting Elizabeth Hurst, at Newport, on the 8th July, and occasioning her actual bodily harm. Mr. Poulden for the prosecution and Mr. Cooke for the prisoner. Mr. Poulden, in opening the prosecution, said the case was of a peculiar nature, though the conduct of the prisoner amounted in law to an assault. The prisoner was in company with two or three girls of questionable character at the King's Arms public-house, in Pyle-street, Newport, the 8th instant. The prisoner went into the room where the girls were and drank some beer with them. He ordered two quarts of beer in succession, from which the girls, at his invitation, partook. He then ordered a third quart, but before any of this was drank, the prisoner was seen to put something into the cup and pour out a glassful of the liquor and put it back again. He did this several times in order to mix the substance put in the beer. He then again invited the girls to drink, and they did so, but complained of the beer having a nasty taste. The prisoner soon after left, and he had not been gone but very short time when the girls, especially Hurst, became exceedingly sick and ill, suffering from burning and swelling of the stomach and other symptoms beyond all doubt caused by some deleterious substance put into the beer.

Before the examination of witnesses, Mr. Cooke, on behalf of the prisoner, took an objection to the indictment, and cited cases in support of his argument that the offence, if proved, was not even an assault at common law. By the act of last session referring to the administration of chloroform and other stupifying preparations for the purposes of enabling a felony to be committed, the party so offending was adjudged guilty of felony. In this case the allegation was not that the drug was administered in order to commit a felony, and the offence was not a felony, neither did it become common assault. The objection was allowed to stand over till the facts of the case had been heard in evidence.

The prosecutrix Hurst being examined, said the prisoner tasted the beer of the third quart brought in, but spat it out again. She also added that he called in a fourth quart and took it behind the door, after which he held a glassfull of the liquor to her lips until she had drank the whole of it. The prisoner also just tasted the last quart of ale, but spat it out of his mouth and went away laughing. The waiter said the prisoner had put something in the beer, and told the girls not to drink any of it. The effects of the drink made the prosecutrix ill for two or three days. She was violently sick with burning in the throat and stomach, and her clothes were obliged to be loosed in consequence of her becoming much swollen. She said she saw the prisoner put something in the third quart, but she did not at the time suspect it was anything that would cause them harm.

In reference to the legal objection, the learned Sergeant said it was clear that the prosecutrix had confidence in the prisoner, and drunk the mixture voluntarily; and considering the cases referred to him by the counsel for the defence, he was of opinion that the conduct of the prisoner, although he had been guilty of a very wicked act, did not amount to an assault at common law. The Judge then directed the Jury to return a verdict of Not Guilty. The prisoner was then cautioned by the Judge as to his future conduct, and discharged from custody. 

```

Even though there seems to have been no doubt that the doctored beer had caused an unpleasant reaction, the willingness of the prosecutrix to drink it meant that there was no offense of assault.

HAMPSHIRE ASSIZES

A NOVEL KIND OF ASSAULT.

Timothy Mahoney was indicted for assaulting Elizabeth Hurst, at Newport, on the evening of the 8th of July. Mr. Poulden prosecuted, and Mr. Cooke defended the prisoner. The facts of the case are as follows :—

The prosecutrix and some other girl, were at the King's Arms Inn, Pyle-street, Newport, on the above evening, where they met the prisoner, who asked them to have something to drink. Accordingly some beer was produced, and before the prisoner gave it to them to drink he was observed to put something into it, and the women who drank it, among them the prosecutrix, were shortly after their draught taken ill with vomiting and a burning kind of feeling in the throat and stomach.

Mr. Cooke objected that the case was not legally one of assault, and cited several cases in support of his objection.

The learned Serjeant agreed with Mr. Cooke, and said that it was not a case of assault at Common Law unless the intent of administering the drug or noxious composition was proved. It clearly did not come within the statute unless the prosecution were prepared to show that some coercion was used to compel the prosecutrix to take the liquor, he could not see how an indictment for assault could be maintained. It would be better, perhaps, to hear what the prosecutrix had to say.

The prosecutrix was called, and stated the case as above, also that no force was used to get them to drink.

The case was quashed, and the prisoner discharged with a suitable caution.

Not arriving with his mail-bag, which was due at Carisbrooke at six o'clock in the evening, Mr. Redstone, the Carisbrooke postmaster, and a neighbour named Jones, set off on the Calbourne road in search of him, and ultimately discovered him in a ditch, under a bank, benumbed, asleep with the cold, and covered with the drifting snow. He was conveyed home, and is recovering under the surgical aid of Mr. Tuttiett, surgeon.

ISLE OF WIGHT PETTY SESSIONS. COUNTY BENCH.

Saturday.— Magistrates present: Sir John Simeon, bart., Chairman, Captains Hamond, Crozier, and Duff, and Le Marchant Thomas, esq.

Charles Gosling, a private of the 96th depôt, stationed at Parkhurst Barracks, was charged by Colour Serjeant George Wolfe, the Pay Serjeant of the depot, with robbing him of a £5 note, a sovereign, and upwards of a pound principally in fourpenny-pieces. From his evidence, it appeared that the prisoner was employed by him as a kind of "batman" for general purposes. On Tuesday, the 25th instant, after taking from his box upwards of a pound to give a serjeant to pay some of his men, he locked the box containing the sum stolen in a bag, and secreted the key behind his looking-glass, when he left the barracks on leave for the night, the prisoner being in his quarters to do whatever was necessary; and when he returned the next morning be found the bag and money had been abstracted from the box. The prisoner had no liberty to go to the box.

In answer to questions from the prisoner, the prosecutor said he did not ask him for any money before he left the barracks, neither did he say "There's the bag in the box." He never entrusted him with the key, neither did he say "There's the key behind the box, you can take what you like." All that he said to him before he went away was, that he had given out some crime papers to a Serjeant.

Serjeant John Platt, of the 96th depôt, stated that he was in the same room with the prosecutor, and on the evening in question saw the prisoner go to the box of Serjeant Wolfe, open it, and take something out. There was only a fire-light, but he did it openly. His wife told him she had seen him go there before, so he thought it was all right. They spoke a word or two to each other in a general way. He had seen the prisoner in town between four and five that afternoon. He had the key then, and told him he was going home to get some "tin." Witness thought Serjeant Wolfe had sent him.

Catherine Platt, wife of the last witness, also deposed to seeing the prisoner unlock the box, and take something out; she told her husband of the circumstance.

Cross-examined by the prisoner— Had seen money put there by the prosecutor. Did not see the prisoner take 5s out of a bag in the box, neither did she hear him make any remark about his doing so.

Timothy Donovan, a corporal of the 96th depôt, deposed to being in company with the prisoner at the Adam and Eve public-house, in Newport, on the night of the 26th of November. He ordered some porter, which he paid for in fourpenny-pieces, and said he had bought some boot-laces, and in pulling them out, he drew out at least half-a-dozen of fourpenny-pieces, which fell about the floor.

Elizabeth Hurst, a woman of loose character, stated that the prisoner was with her in the public-house in the evening, when he called for several quantities of porter and rum, which he paid for in fourpenny-pieces and sixpences. He left at "tattoo" time, and did not return till between ten and eleven, when he sat down by the side of another girl, named Parsons, and had some more rum. for which he gave a fourpenny-piece. They all after-wards went to her companion's lodgings, in Paradise-row, taking some rum with them.

Edith Parsons confirmed the last witness's statements.

Police-constable John Batley deposed that having received information of the robbery, and the prisoner having absconded from the barracks, he apprehended him in Newport on Thursday, and charged him with the robbery. He said he knew nothing of it, and inquired as to the amount missing. He told him upwards of £7. He replied, "That's all I want to know; all the money I had was from a serjeant, to pay some of his bills in town." Witness searched him, and found four fourpenny-pieces only on him.

This closing the evidence, the prisoner said in defence that he was sorry he had had any connexion with the man. He had been making away with the money, and now he had to settle up his accounts he wanted to saddle his defalcations on his back. Not a day passed that he took a pound from his box, and broke out of the barracks at night to spend it, and that was more than he could afford to spend. He certainly did take 5s out of the bag, and that was all; but the prosecutor had given him the key night after night. He had been fourteen years in the service, and was as innocent of intentionally defrauding as any gentleman on the Bench. They had not found the £5 note on him, and he should like the prosecutor to state what was the number of the note he said he had lost. After a short consultation, the Magistrates committed him to take his trial at the Assizes at Winchester, which commenced on Monday.
