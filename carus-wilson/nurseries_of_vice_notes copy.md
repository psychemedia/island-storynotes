# Nurseries of Vice

The context for this is a reference I happened across to a pamphlet entitled "Tempters and Tempted" which appears to have ranted against Newport as a hotbed of vice corrupting the soldiers barracked at Parkhurst. A later pamphlet also became the subject of a libel case against local dignitary, F. Pittis.

I still haven't managed to track down either pamphlet...

Many of the same names and drinking establishments appear regularly in the court reports (I have not included all reports, so the sample below is skewed) which suggests a possible cast of characters and locations for some sort of telling...

Context: Crimean War, October 1853 – March 1856; troops start going out Spring/Summer 1854

FRIENDLESS AND FALLEN.

To the Editor of the Isle of Wight Observer.

Sir, —The influence happily exercised by the English press giving publicity to the operations of benevolent enterprises induces me to solicit your aid in pleading the cause of an institution designed to afford the relief so urgently needed for the unhappy victims of immorality. The public are already too well acquainted with one phase of this wide-spread and melancholy evil: a glance at every public thoroughfare at once acquaints the observer with it. Such a view, however, gives but a very imperfect representation all that involved in a life prostitution. The fallen woman is there recognised under circumstances which naturally excite but little sympathy. To be seen in her true state —when the woman is herself again—it is necessary to visit her in her miserable abode, which is seldom without some valued relic serving to remind her of the time when she was virtuous and happy, and to which she clings amid all her misery and wretchedness. It is then that hollowness and shame of the life of so-called gaiety is seen, as the unhappy victim of sin, shorn of her finery and false appearance, realises her position as an outcast! When the fever of excitement is lulled, and the calmness of solitude enforces reflection, I say she then realises her misery, and I speak advisedly. Few can understand the suffering an immoral life entails. Seven years is its average length, and into its brief span crowded painful and distressing experience. Fully seventy per cent, of the unhappy creatures who crowd our streets have suffered their first fall through the wiles of the betrayers, thus losing their characters and their means of livelihood through one false step. Abandoned in their fall, without friend or counsellor, they have descended grade by grade until they reached the lowest depth in the social scale. These poor victims of a sinful life have experienced trials which would excite pity in the hardest heart, could all their sufferings be told. Many are supporting illegitimate children out of the wage of unchasteness, whose morality they carefully watch over. It must not be supposed that the majority fell into the condition of outcasts without struggling to regain their former position of respectability. Many have been domestic servants, needlewomen, &c., and the cry that is continually heard is, "Who will now employ me without a character?" "Now that I have fallen, who will receive me?" Many a poor girl cast out to struggle upon the streets for the want of a helping hand to aid in restoring her. The London Female Preventive and Reformatory Institution has laboured in full view of all the distressing incidents which a mission to the fallen can only reveal, and the promoters of the institution are impressed with the importance of further efforts for the rescue of this unhappy class of our fellow-creatures. Now, sir, the institution whose claims upon the sympathy of the benevolent public, with your permission, I fain would urge, has been instrumental in aiding no less than 2,6O5 friendless and fallen women since its establishment in 1857, and the committee rejoice that the liberality of the subscribers has thus enabled them not only to effect the moral restitution of the majority of that number, but also to eliminate from society such a large proportion of painful and destructive an element. The institution now supports seven distinct homes, the particulars and operations which are contained in a detailed report, which will be most gladly forwarded to any taking an interest the subject, or who would like to inspect the homes. At the opening of the present year the committee, having funds at their disposal, authorised the admission (on any day) of friendless and fallen females anxious to reform; they also determined (seeing how many unhappy victims are inveigled from foreign countries) to extend the benefits of the institution to all fitting applicants, irrespective of birth or creed, thus enlarging the basis of their operations, and limiting it only by the amount of funds placed at their disposal. During the present year 430 poor creatures have been admitted, and have partaken of the shelter of the homes; of that number 285 were fallen, and 145 were friendless young women. Unhappily, *five hundred applicants* had to be *refused* for want of means to provide further accommodation. When all the homes are full, no less than 3,000 meals per week have to be provided for the support of the inmates. And in order to meet these and other necessary expenses, the committee are entirely dependent upon the voluntary, and often daily, contributions of the benevolent public. Aided by the experience gained in past operations, the committee have carefully arranged the working of each home. Five are devoted to the reception of fallen women only, one for those who have never fallen from the path of virtue, and another for the reception of convalescent young women of good character leaving hospitals and asylums. To secure a discriminate selection from the applications in the latter ease, a qualified female attends the various hospitals, &c., in order to seek the most suitable candidates for admission. In addition to the above, the committee have established a Night Reception House (admitting neither tramps nor vagrants), the doors of which remain open *all night* to receive the fallen women weary of a life of so much suffering and reproach, the only qualification necessary being proof of a desire to forsake the sinful course. In this asylum, Christianlike and genial, though severely plain, of necessity it must be, 450 of the "fallen" gladly took temporary shelter, were lodged, fed, conversed with, and then referred to homes, or places of refuge for penitent and suffering humanity. It known that one-half of these have been arrested in their miserable career and saved from moral and spiritual destruction. Of the inmates of the homes generally, many are restored to their friends, others undergo a training which qualifies them for domestic or other service; many are assisted to emigrate, and all brought under the influence Godly instruction, in which the Gospel of salvation is placed plainly before them. And now, sir, our *funds are exhausted*, and an account of our stewardship ready to be rendered. The cold blasts of wintry nights are sending us importunate applicants who, in sorrow and contrition, plead for shelter and relief. Must they be *rejected*, "and find no place of repentance, though they seek it carefully and with tears?" I would again appeal to the rich to spare of their abundance to relieve the great cry of suffering which goes up to heaven from the stricken hearts of poor perishing "fallen" women. I would appeal to those in humble circumstances to give a mite, even in their poverty, to this blessed work, for from many a cottage home throughout the land has the poor girl come, who has been betrayed and cast out in this great city. Those who are neutral, both in possessions and sentiment towards this mission, I entreat to "come over and help us", that we may not mock with cold and hollow sympathy, destitute of the means necessary to provide relief and rescue, the many who so earnestly seek reclamation.

I am, Sir, your obedient servant,

E. W. THOMAS, Sed.  
200, Euston-road, London, N.W.

Isle of Wight County Press - Saturday 09 November 1889

THE LATE SIR FRANCIS PITTIS.

At St. Thomas's Church, Newport, on Sunday morning last, the prayers of the congregation were desired "for Francis Pittis." It was known that for some days Sir Francis had been in a critical condition, but it was not thought that the end was so near. About half-past one on Sunday afternoon he breathed his last. His illness was not of long duration, and knowing his strength of constitution and the longevity of some members of his family—his mother died at the patriarchal age of 90—the hope was cherished to the last that we should see him amongst us again. With his son-in-law, Dr. T. Waterworth, and Dr. Allan Waterworth in constant attendance, and with Dr. Groves in consultation, all that medical skill could do was done, and all the care that love could suggest was lavished upon him; but death was inexorable, and the end came as we have said, faced with calm faith and compassed with peace. By the death of Sir Francis, Newport loses its foremost citizen. For the extent of a whole generation his name has been prominently associated with the public life of the borough, and he served the town with an ardour and a devotion which will not soon be forgotten. When William Baron Mew, Robert Pinnock, and Francis Pittis sat at the same table as Aldermen of the Corporation of Newport, that body possessed three members who, in point of business capacity and high personal character, could not be surpassed in any municipality in the country. "All, all are gone, the old familiar faces."

Alderman Sir Francis Pittis, J.P., who was in his 78th year, was a native of Newport, and was descended of a very ancient and honourable Isle of Wight family. One of his ancestors —the Rev. Thomas Pittis D. D.—was in 1683 rector of Gatcombe and Chaplain in ordinary to His Majesty King Charles the Second, and another ancestor was, some two centuries ago, vicar of Brading. Members of the family were buried at Niton, in the parish church of which place there are tablets to their memory. Other members were buried at Whippingham, and when the church there was rebuilt, the inscribed stones were removed and braes plates with similar inscriptions were placed near the spot, in front of the pew occupied by Her Majesty the Queen. Sir Francis was educated at a school at Newport—a very large private establishment, which was located in fine premises in Quay-street, since pulled down. The school was under the patronage of Queen Victoria's father, the Duke of Kent, whose name it bore, and it was for many years conducted by the Abbé De Grenthe, and afterwards by Mr. Alexander Clarke, an uncle of Sir Francis. His connection with the Corporation of Newport extended over a period of about 40 years, but he was actively identified with public matters in the town before he entered the Council. He was first elected to the Mayoralty in 1852, and he was re-elected in 1853. This year was rendered memorable by the visit of the late Prince Consort to the town for the purpose of laying the foundation stone of the parish church —the stately edifice of which the inhabitants of Newport are so justly proud. As Mayor of the borough it fell to Sir Francis to receive and entertain His Royal Highness, and the dignified manner in which he represented the town on that occasion won universal admiration. In 1859, 1861, and 1862 Sir Francis was again elected to the chief civic office, and it was during the last of these three Mayoralties that another notable event occurred—the marriage of the Prince of Wales. With Sir Francis at its head, Newport right loyally did honour to the occasion. It will be remembered that on the day of their marriage the Prince and Princess came to Osborne, and the Mayor and Corporation, who had proceeded by water to Cowes in State barges, presented an address to their Royal Highnesses on their landing at Trinity Wharf, East Cowes. In 1877 Sir Francis was elected to the Mayoral office for the sixth time, and he was re-elected in 1878. It was at the close of hie seventh term of office that it was resolved that the great services of Sir Francis to the town called for public recognition. and a testimonial fund was started, to which all classes of the inhabitants, as well as many friends outside the borough, contributed; and on March 14, 1880, in the presence of a large representative assembly, a splendid painting of a Hampshire scene, by George Cole, was presented to him, together with an address embodying the sentiments of esteem and of gratitude which animated the donors. We now come to the crowning event in the long and honoured public career of Sir Francis Pittis. By the Queen's desire, the celebration of the Jubilee of Her Majesty's reign was arranged to take place in 1887, and towards the close of 1886 the question was raised in Newport, as in other boroughs, who should be the Jubilee Mayor? In Newport there was no difficulty in arriving at a choice. Everybody felt that, by virtue of age, experience, service, it was most fitting that the Mayoralty in so auspicious and memorable a year should be held by the then "Mr." Alderman Francis Pittis. We gave repeated expressions to this feeling at the time, as did also our contributor "Stylus," whose words we quote now because of the prophetic touch that there was about them. In our issue of November 6, 1886, "Stylus wrote: "The Mayoralty, it is understood, is placed entirely at the disposal of Mr. Alderman Pittis, who is in every way deserving of the proffered honour. I trust that he will accept it, and that before the year has run its course I may have the inexpressible happiness of greeting him as 'Sir Francis'". Our contributor, alike with us all, *had* that happiness. Although feeling the pressure of advancing age, Mr. Alderman Pittis readily placed himself at the service of the Corporation and of the borough, and on the 9th of November, 1886, he was elected Mayor of Newport for the eighth time unanimously elected, South and North rising together and blending their acclamations. In the course of the speech in which he acknowledged the honour he said "He could have wished, indeed, that their choice had fallen on a younger man, for when one's age had advanced beyond three score years and ten, he naturally looked for some repose, but, thank God! if he had not so much physical activity as he had years ago, his head, he was glad to believe, was right, and his heart was still the same, inclining him to do all in his power to promote the well-being and the prosperity of his native borough." Here we have expressed that which was always a ruling motive with Sir Francis Pittis—an anxious desire to do the best he could for the town of his birth. With what marvellous energy and enthusiasm—very marvellous indeed, considering his years— Newport's Jubilee Mayor entered into the arrangements for fittingly celebrating the year's event our readers will readily remember. Newport came out grandly. Who that saw it is likely to forget the magnificent scene which the town presented on that 22nd of July when the Queen visited the town and received an address at the hands of the Mayor! It was in Her Majesty's reply to this address that she gave utterance to words which the people of Newport should treasure and which ought to have been printed in gold and placed within the Council Chamber of the borough: "The interest which my dear husband took in the welfare of your town," said the Queen, "has always been shared by me, and I pray that the prosperity which has attended you for the last fifty years may continue, and that the happiness of your fellow citizens may increase for the remainder of my reign." From the first it was the strong desire of the then Mayor that Newport should possess some permanent memorial of the Jubilee —"something," as he once remarked, "which shall tell those who come after us of the sentiments of loyalty and devotion to the Throne which animated their ancestors in the year of the Victorian Jubilee." How he clung to this idea — how persistently he pushed forward the construction of the Jubilee clock tower, how at length he saw it accomplished, and how munificently he cleared off a deficit on the fund — our local records tell. On the morning of August 9, 1887, the Mayor received an intimation from the Prime Minister that the Queen had been pleased to confer on him the honour of knighthood. How the town received this gracious news was reflected in our columns at the time. "As the intelligence became known congratulations poured in upon his worship, in the course of the day the bells of St. Thomas's Church rang jubilant peals, flags were displayed in various parts of the town, and the one theme of absorbing conversation was the distinction with which the Queen had been pleased to crown the career of one of the worthiest and most honoured citizens of Newport." On the 12th of August the Mayor went to Osborne, and was there knighted by the Queen. The distinction never had a worthier recipient, but Sir Francis disclaimed any personal title to it, preferring to regard it as an honour done, through him, to Newport. The Queen afterwards conferred the Jubilee decoration upon him. The connection of Sir Francis Pittis with the Council terminated only with his life. He was present at the last monthly meeting, sitting in his accustomed place on the right of the Mayor, and he joined in the discussion of several questions which came before the meeting. It will be impossible to fill the blank in the Corporation which the death of Sir Francis has occasioned, because there are none left who possess the vast amount of experience which he in the course of his long public life had accumulated. The interests of Newport always lay very near to his heart, and whenever a voice has been necessary to be heard in their defence, he has spoken with a voice that none have surpassed. Proud of its history, jealous of its honour, and solicitous for its welfare, he served Newport in his day and generation with conspicuous devotion, and its roll of citizens bears no more honoured name.

Sir Francis filled many other public positions. He was the senior member of the Newport borough Bench, and here, again, his long experience, added to a sound judgment, lent great weight to his opinion. Taking a deep interest in education, Sir Francis was a member of the first Newport School Board, and his connection with it was maintained up to the time of his death. He was chairman of the Charity Trustees, and by his decease the old Grammar School of Newport, to the foundation of which one of his ancestors munificently contributed, loses one of its best and staunchest friends. He was also chairman of the Burial Board, chairman of the committee of the Art Class, senior trustee of the Blue School, and a member of the committee of the National Schools. In politics he was a thorough-going Conservative, and had been for many years recognised as one of the leaders of the party in the Isle of Wight. With him loyalty to the Throne and to the Constitution was a passion, and the prayer for "the safety, honour, and welfare of our Sovereign and her dominions," was with him not an utterance of the lips merely, but a fervent aspiration of the heart. Possessing a commanding voice, a manly presence, and marked power of utterance, he was years ago one of the most effective political speakers in the Isle of Wight, and he had always the courage of his convictions. Those convictions were strong, and so occasionally were the words in which they were expressed—too strong sometimes for his opponents, but while the latter might differ from the views enunciated, they always respected the consistency of the speaker. And this consistency was undeviatingly characteristic of Sir Francis Pittis. What he believed to be right he inflexibly pursued, in shine or shade, and in this respect, as well as in his integrity of purpose, his rectitude of conduct, and his devotion to duty, he has left us of to-day and those who shall take our places in the days to come an example which we and they will do well to strive worthily to follow. As we have said, Sir Francis had reached the age of 77. His wife pre-deceased him in 1878. He leaves one son—Mr. Councillor Francis Pittis, J.P.,—and two daughters, one of whom, Miss Pittis, so gracefully performed the duties of Mayoress in the Jubilee year.

The intelligence that Sir Francis had passed away became generally known throughout the town on Sunday afternoon, and regret and sympathy were everywhere expressed regret at the loss of so honoured and eminently useful a citizen, and sympathy with the members of the bereaved family in their sorrow. At St. Thomas's church, on Sunday evening, the Rev. R. R. Farrant, in closing his sermon, said since they met there that morning one had passed away full of faith and years, who deserved pre-eminently well of that place. From his work here we knew that he had been called into the safe-keeping of a loving and most just Father. We knew, too, that for those who were in sorrow now there was the consolation that the Saviour could give, with the assurance that He is the resurrection and the life. And, he thought, that where there was any appreciation of devotion to duty, of consistent adherence to principle, and of inflexible integrity of life, the memory of him who had been taken from our midst that day would be retained and cherished. At the close of the sermon the hymn "O, let him whose sorrow" was sung, and Mr. Scadding, presiding at the organ, played the "Dead March" in *Saul*, the whole congregation standing. At the Mission Hall service the same evening, the Rev. Dr. Burton, before the prayer for all sorts and condition of men, asked for the prayers of the Church on behalf of the family of the late Sir Francis Pittis, and at the commencement of hie sermon the Doctor said that only that morning they prayed for "Francis Pittis" in church, and they now prayed for those survivors who so sorely needed their sympathy. He believed that the whole of Newport sympathised with them that one and all were as men "mourning when their leaders fall." Sir Francis had been a great man in that town. He had been eight times Mayor, and was foremost in every good work, notably that of the building of the parish church. He was the last of those whose names were engraved upon the foundation stone —great names placed there in no spirit of selfish arrogance, but simply as setting forth the true history of how nobly they had striven and would strive *ad majorem Dei gloriam*. That was neither the time nor the place to attempt to sum up all that Sir Francis Pittis had done for Newport. It would be sufficient to say that his record was a clean and noble one. He had left a stimulus and a bright example to the youth of that town, and withal a very encouraging example, showing how a strict adherence to truth and duty would bring a man to eminence during his life time, with "peace at the last," when that well-spent life was over. The lesson seemed to be summed up in those grand words of the Poet Laureate—

"Not once or twice in our fair Island story,  
The path of duty was the way to glory;  
He, that ever following her commands,  
On with toil of heart and knees and hands,  
Through the long gorge to the far light has won  
His path upward, and prevailed,  
Shall find the toppling crags of Duty scaled  
Are close upon the shining table-lands  
To which our Go Himself is moon and sun."

—The St. Thomas's Men's Bible Class, and also the Women's Bible Class, have sent letters of sympathy, signed by the members, to the family of the late Sir Francis. At the Wesleyan Chapel on Sunday evening, the Rev. George Wood, the officiating minister, prayed that the members of the family might receive consolation in the hour of their bereavement. He also prayed that the town might take to heart the lesson of the event of that day—that however life may be filled with the business of this world, however distinguished in station, however influential upon others, and however protracted in its duration, the end must come and that one event happeneth to all. The Rev. W. B. Lark, at the Bible Christian Chapel the same evening, in the course of an address to young men on "Manliness," referred to the death of Sir Francis Pittis, whom he held up as an example of unswerving integrity and of faithful and unshaken adherence to the principles which in his heart he believed to be right. In the prayer which followed Mr. Lark commended the bereaved to the Comforter, whose divine solace in such times of sorrow was the only effectual consolation.

THE FUNERAL, YESTERDAY.

The funeral of the late Sir Francis Pittis took place yesterday (Friday), and very impressive and touching were the tributes of respect paid to his memory. Throughout the town shutters were closed and blinds were drawn; flags at halfmast were flying at the Guildhall, the Mayor's residence, the County Pre. offices, the Conservative Club, and other places; and at intervals the bells of St. Thomas's Church rang muffled peals. The Mayor, the borough magistrates, members of the Corporation, and municipal officers met at the Guildhall at half-past eleven and proceeded to the grounds of Newport House, where a large number of other townsmen, with many friends from various parts of the Island, also assembled.

The funeral procession left Newport House at noon. The coffin, borne in an open car, was completely concealed by beautiful floral wreaths. The carriages following contained— 1st carriage, Mr. Pittis, Dr. Waterworth, Master L Waterworth, and Mr. E. A. Pittis. 2nd, Mr. R. F. Eldridge, Mr. James Eldridge, jun., Mr. Wells, and Mr. F. Stratton. 3rd, Mr. George, Mr. Aitken, Mr. W. T. Way Bucket', and Mr. Roach Pittis. 4th, Mr. Mortimer, Dr. Allan Water. worth, Dr. Groves, and the Rev. C. E. Seaman. 5tb, Mr. Wetherick, Mr. Dockrill, Mr. Gustar, and Mr. Goodhall. There were a number of other carriages. At the head of the civic proceession walked members of the police force, followed by Town Sergt. Tiley and Sergt. Salter, bearing the borough maces, draped in crape. Slowly the procession moved to the church.

Meanwhile a numerous congregation had already assembled at St. Thomas's Church, including the girls of the Blue School, in which Sir Francis took so deep an interest, and pending the arrival of the procession Mr. Scadding, presiding at the organ, played Chopin's "Funeral March, and "I know that my Redeemer liveth." The body was received at the west entrance of the church by Archdeacon Haigh, with whom were the Rev. Dr. Burton and the Rev. R. R. Farrant. The Archdeacon read the opening sentences of the Burial Office as the coffin, bright with exquisite flowers, was borne up the nave, the procession towards the chancel being headed by the surpliced choir of the church. The Mayor, magistrates,and members of the Corporation occupied the chancel stalls. The great congregation having been seated, the choir sang "Lord, thou hast been our refuge," after which the lesson was read by the Archdeacon, and the service at the church closed with the singing of the beautiful hymn, "Now the labourer's task is o'er," rendered by the choir with solemn and impressive effect. Then, as the body was carried from the church, the organ, responding to the touch of the master who presided at it, wailed forth the strains of the "Dead March," and the bells rang a muffled dirge. The ceremony at the grave was also performed by the Archdeacon. The scene here, with its crowd of mounters, all moved by one common feeling of respect for the honoured dead and of sadness at the thought that his place amongst them will be known no more, was one that will not soon be forgotten by those who witnessed it. The grave of Sir Francis—the sides of which were covered with bright flowers and verdant leafage—is between those of his wife and his mother, and close by are the resting places of William Baron Mew and Thomas Parker Mew, who were so intimately associated with him in life, and whose own graves were bright with flowers on this day when their friend of old days had come to join them, life's well.fought battle over. "Earth to earth, ashes to ashes, dust to dust." The solemn words are said, and as all that was mortal of Sir Francis Pittis passes from view there comes to mind the sentiment of that hymn which had moved all hearts in the church where he worshipped—

"Now the labourer's task is o'er;  
Now the battle day is peat;  
Now upon the farther shore  
Lands the voyager at last.  
Father, in Thy gracious keeping  
Leave we now Thy servant sleeping."

The Mayor received letters from Mr. W. Major Cooke, J.P. and Mr. Councillor J. E. Snellgrove, regretting their inability to be present, the latter stating that he has been confined to the house for the last three weeks by illness. Mr. W. H.

IN MEMORIAM

Toll the deepest sombre knell!  
He is gone we prized so well—  
He who fame and title won—  
Newport's honoured, gifted son.

Filling oft the civic chair,  
Hailed as oft our chosen Mayor,  
Listened to with anxious heed,  
To advise in every need.

We shall sadly miss his face,—  
Sadly view his vacant place,  
And, despite the noblest aim,  
Miss the magic of his name.

Yet its spell will linger long,  
Far above the general throng;  
Eloquent, and wise, and true,—  
Gifts were his possessed by few.

All is hushed! himself is gone,  
Large remembrance ours alone;  
His fair life—a public boon—  
Closed has been, alas! too soon!

Toll the deepest sombre knell!  
Gone is he we prised so well;  
Deep inscribe his honoured name  
On the massive plinth of fame.

A.M.


FRANCIS PITTIS, KNIGHT,
 
True heart, your voice on this fair earth is still.  
Your spirit breathes a better peace afar;  
We cannot give or say what we would will,  
We cannot Bee or know you as you *are*.

You have been faithful: *that* is truest *blood*;  
You have been loved, and *that* is fairest *fame*,  
You have been true, and *that* is noblest *good*:  
The people honour You and praise your name.

Newport, 1.W., Nov. 8, 1889. WOLEBMNUR.
