# Nurseries of Vice


The context for this is a reference I happened across to a pamphlet entitled "Tempter and Tempted" which appears to have ranted against Newport as a hotbed of vice corrupting the soldiers barracked at Parkhurst. A later pamphlet also became the subject of a libel case against local dignitary, F. Pittis.

I still haven't managed to track down either pamphlet...

Many of the same names and drinking establishments appear regularly in the court reports (I have not included all reports, so the sample below is skewed) which suggests a possible cast of characters and locations for some sort of telling...

Context: Crimean War, October 1853 – March 1856; troops start going out Spring/Summer 1854

Portsmouth Times and Naval Gazette - Saturday 26 January 1856

OPENING OF A SOLDIERS’ INSTITUTE AT PORTSMOUTH.

On Wednesday evening a meeting was held on the opening of the Soldiers’ Institution, which has been established in King-street, Portsmouth, to afford the soldiers quartered this garrison a library, reading-room, and other conveniences, in which they can employ their time in reading, or other rational amusements during their leisure hours.

The Institution has been established mainly through the instrumentality the Rev. W. Carus Wilson, who first brought the subject forward, and who has been nobly seconded by the officers in the garrison.

Above 100 soldiers, principally of the Artillery, were present at the meeting, nearly fifty whom gave in their names members of the Institution, at the close of the meeting.

Captain Tate occupied the chair, and was supported the Rev. Mr. Childs, Rev. W.C. Wilson, Capt. Campbell, Capt. Savage, G. Rylands, Esq., C. Bintead, Esq. Revs. J. Knapp, J. Power, Capt. Hawke, and others, would have been there, had not circumstances prevented them.

The Chairman, in opening the proceedings, said that for the formation of the Institution they were greatly indebted to the philanthropic spirit of the Rev. W. C. Wilson, through whose exertions it had been brought forward. In the Institution the soldier would find every comfort—newspapers, library, coffee rooms, and every means of rational instruction and amusement, which he hoped would keep many from the haunts which abounded in the town, and lead them to understand that a vicious course of life was incompatible with true happiness. (Cheers.)

Rev. Mr. Childs said he would endeavour to place before the meeting the object they had in view in forming the institute. He formerly lived in a garrison town ( Devonport) for some time, and well knew what inducements were held out to young men in such towns to lead them into wrong paths, and the necessity there existed for the formation of some counteracting influence. The rev. gentlemen then pointed out to the meeting the hideousness of vice, by relating an incident which occurred during his residence Devonport. It was at the death-bed of a woman, who some years previously had been instrumental in causing a marine—her companion in vice—to be transported for a felony, which she, herself, had committed. He described the fearful effects produced by conscience in her last moments, and continued: Their object in forming the institution was to provide them with a "Clubhouse," as it might called, where, when they left their barracks, they might have a lounge, read the papers, and perhaps meet a friend—where they might smoke their pipe, spin a yarn, and fight their battles over again. (Cheers.) If they did not like smoking, there was another room where they could have a quiet cup of coffee, and a comfortable chat with a companion. The room they were now in was the general room, where they would have placed upon a table all the news of the day, by which they might watch their companions in arms fighting for their country in other lands. (Cheers.) They would also have library and class rooms, where he hoped they would get mutual instruction amongst themselves. They did not want see them crammed with lectures, but see them gathering honey for themselves. That was a great fault in Mechanics’ Institutes; they gave information, without teaching men to exert themselves; it was if they crammed the stomach without causing them to earn their bread by the sweat of the brow. If they did the latter, they were better in physical health, and if they strove to learn themselves they would be better in mental health. (Hear, hear.) They wanted to see them form classes amongst themselves, in which those who were well instructed might help the others. It was also desired that they should have the management of the institution in their own hands ; that a committee of management should be formed out of the members. As there was a United Service Club, so they wished to form a kind of club for the troops in garrison, and upon its auspicious opening he begged to congratulate them. (Applause.)

Rev W. Carus Wilson, who in rising was received with much applause, said that whatever they did in the way of contributing to the comfort and happiness of the soldier, was only the payment of a moiety of the debt of gratitude which they owed the brave defenders of our country, and which had been much increased during these critical time. He had long seen the necessity of the formation of such institutions and he must say that, although he had taken part in various undertakings, none had given him greater pleasure and satisfaction than the little efforts which he had been able to put forth on behalf of the soldier. He had been much abroad of late years, and had caused many thousand Bibles to circulated in Italy, especially amongst Sardinian soldiers. He should not enlarge upon this subject, as he had promissed to attend a meeting of the Soldiers’ Friend Society the following Wednesday evening, when he hoped to give much interesting information respecting his labours in that field; he would therefore simply state that the work had been eminently successful ; both officers amd soldiers had taken an interest in it and that at the camp at Boulogne, as well as in Italy, many thousands of Bibles, besides innumerable tracts, had been circulated amongst the soldiery. After speaking of the assistance he had received in the latter piece from the Rev. Mr Brown, the reverend gentleman said that it was a great delight to his mind to meet them that evening, but it was not necessary for him dwell on the advantages of the institution, as that had been so ably done by Mr. Childs, but he would remark that there were many collateral as well as direct advantages attendant upon it. He was glad to see the assimilation of ranks which it produced—that whilst the officer had his club-house, the soldier should have the same, for there was something exceedingly interesting in the fact that men of all ranks and classes were likely to be provided for. He hoped, however, they were as but the commencement of the work, for it was his longing desire to see the "The Soldier's Institute " made as perfect as possible, not only because this was the largest garrison town in the kingdom, but as as encouragement to other places to follow their example. (Cheers.) Some friends at Dover had already made application to him to assist in forming one for the barracks at that town, and he was sure he should find willing helpers there. (Hear, hear.) It would be gratifying to them to know that the proceedings were receiving countenance, not only from the officers of the army universally, but from higher quarters.— Lord Panmure having expressed himself favourable to them. (Applause.) The rev. gentleman then read a letter which had been addressed to Lord Panmure by a military chaplain; it spoke of the temptations to which the soldier was subjected, and remarked that although they could not expect to remove these altogether, it was their duty to do what they could to counteract their influence, and recommended the adoption of a plan similar to that carried out in the formation of the Portsmouth Soldiers' Institute; he said that the ordinary library in the barrack was not sufficiently attractive; something on the principle of a *café* being the *desideratum*. This, continued the speaker, had met with the full approval of Lord Panmure, and whilst considering that they had commenced under very favourable auspices, he hoped to see the day when no garrison town in England would be destitute of such an institution. There was one point he would wish to refer to with to with respect to the collateral advantages of the institution. He thought it best to have it distinct from the barracks, as it would be a greater change for the soldiers, and it would enable them to fraternise with soldiers of other regiments; it would would bring them out from the contracted limit of their own little circle, so that they might compare notes with one another. He thought this an important feature in the institution. (Cheers.) He perfectly agreed in the sentiments of the chaplain in the letter he had read—"No acts of Parliament, no efforts of their own, would keep men from evil, or lead them to good;" but although that was certain, they should do what they could. Men’s minds were always seeking after happiness and enjoyment, and they should give such a spirit every encouragement in a rational way. In the institution they were now such would be found, and they could enjoy their pipe and tobacco at their ease. With regard to smoking, that had been a debated point, but it was ultimately decided that such should be allowed to all who wished to pursue it. In the library they would find books of all kinds, but although they were not all religious books, he would not disguise from them that the great object they had in view was to make them true soldiers of the Cross, for there could be no true happiness without holiness. Many other things would be given them, and they might rest assured that if they found the premises too straight for them, they should be widened—(cheers)—for they would not rest content without endeavouring to promote their happiness, and he would conclude with expressing the earnest hope that God's blessing would rest upon them and their undertaking.

Captain Savage being compelled to take his departure, the Chairman said, that previous to his doing so, he was sure they would all join in giving to him their hearty thanks for the part he had taken in the undertaking. (Loud applause.) Had it not been for the hearty 00-operation of Capt. Savage and other officers, all the efforts of Rev. Mr. Wilson would bare been unavailing. The proposition was carried with acclamation. Captain Campbell would only say a few words, as so much had been said the objects of the institution previous speakers. Thirty years ago, when in India, be could net help noticing the demoralising character of the army, and he therefore congratulated them that they lived in different times. He hoped they would appreciate the benefits of the institution, and that the present building would be found too small for them, when they would find bettor accommodation for them in another place. (Cheers.) would always happy to contribute his mite, and would conclude by wishing prosperity to the undertaking. (Loud applause.) Rev. W. C. Wilson said there was one little fact which he would like to mention. A friend of his, the late Colonel Hewlett, who fell at the attack the Bedan, stated te him some time ago, that whereas out of his regiment of men, there were formerly 30 morning who were brought before him in consequence of having got, into scrape,” since they bad formed institution with library, &c., for the use of the regiment, they had dwindled down six eight. (Applause.) He hoped none in that room would got into such awkward predicaments. Rev. W. C. Wilson, again rising, said be would remark that if any of the members wished to have any alteration or improvement made, their suggestions would receive the utmost attention. Bev. Mr. Childs said that it was desired that a practical committee should bo formed out of their own body, would recommend them to consult together to recommend one from each company or corps, in whom they had confidence, on that committee. Rev. W. C. Wilson read a most beautiful and affecting letter which he had received from soldier at Malta; every word in it breathe a spirit of religious principle, which it was truly delightful to listen to. Rev. W. Livingstone, after remarking on the practice now observed by the greater portion of the clergy of this country, of offering up prayers for the safety of our soldiers during the war, which he stated originated with the Rev. Mr. Wilson, said that the institution had been established to draw the soldiers from the sources of temptation to which was subjected to enable him meet in place where might enjoy himself without danger his morals, with friends belonging to other regiments, so promote that spirit of brotherhood which it was so cheering to behold. remembered not long ago, reading a work in which the writer said the glory of England’s greatness had departed, that in the event another she would have no men who could maintain her honour, but he thought that when 8,000 Englishmen kept 25,000 Russians bay for several hours, there was the same enthusiasm * the same unswerving indomitable bravery in them that there ever was (cheers); indeed, he believed more bravery had been shown in the Crimea than at any time in the Peninsula. (Loud applause.) But whilst they bad shown such bravery in an earthly fight, there was a spiritual conflict with the powers darkness, which with God's grace, they should carry on strongly and heroically, and he hoped that the establishment of this institution would enable them carry on that fight with success, and prayed that as they bad met together that evening, they would meet together before the throne grace. G. Esq., as one of the Committee, said that other classes of the community had institutions and associations in which they met together for mutual improvement; and so when Mr. Wilson proposed the establishment of soldier’s institute, they thought it but right that the soldier should possess the same advantages. (Cheers.) hoped they would distinctly understand that their wish was that the institution should be under the control the members themselves; and they hoped that if there was any paper placed upon the table which a majority of them did not approve of any other which they would like have, they would inform them it, and their wishes would be complied with. The time which the institution should bo opened would also be left for them decide upon. Every suggestion they might make, which would add their comfort or convenience, would be attended to, as Committee wished to make a model institution from which other towns might take a copy. (Hear, bear.) As had been remarked by former speakers, they would find the table in the room in which they were sitting covered with magazines; the library filled with useful and entertaining books; class rooms, and lecture rooms; they might also, if they preferred it, have some one read to them. Every thing that was possible be accomplished would be done to afford them instruction; and he hoped that not only every one present would join, but that each would induce a comrade go with him. (Applause.) Rev. C. Wilcox, alter stating that the rules of the institution admitted all soldiers the garrison its benefits on payment of a 1d. per week, said that coffee also would furnished the lowest possible price. He had determined be the first taste the coffee made in the institution, and he must any that never tasted any better in England. (Applause.) The committee had also decided on opening the institution on the Sunday, not for reading the newspapers, or anything secular character, but for admittance to the religious works in library, A«. (Applause.) To make the work quite complete, the institution would be furnished with materials for amusement (but not for gambling) in the shape of draught and chess boards and men, backgammon, and a bagatelle board (cheers); these would be supplied with the understanding that, directly or indirectly, no gambling would be allowed. one set of any of these was not found be sufficient, was sure tho Committee would gladly furnish more. (Applause.) . « . »r vote of thanks was then given the Secretary, Mr. Batchelor, and tho Chairman; and G. Rylands, Esq., having stated that a gentleman (Mr. D. Barker), agent of Soldiers’ Friend Society, had come down from W inch ester n,\ attended the meeting obtain some information preparatory to forming similar institution in that town, The meeting separated, about fifty, we before stated, giving in their names as members.

SOLDIERS' INSTITUTES.—

On the 23rd January last, the Soldiers' Institute at Portsmouth was opened. It was described in the prospectus, a copy of which has been forwarded to us by a gentleman who takes much interest in the soldiers' welfare, the Rev. W. Carus Wilson:—

"The Soldiers' Institute comprises a reading-room, supplied with daily and weekly newspapers, and most of the  leading and useful periodicals and current literature of the day. Joined to this, a library for the exclusive use of the members, embracing works in every department in literature, as well as others that may prove useful in their profession. Class-rooms for mutual improvement, and occasional lectures, add another feature to the general object. United with the above are two coffee-rooms, which it is hoped will contribute to the comfort of the members, and tend to lessen the frequenting of public-houses. The subscription is fixed at one penny per week, for which a cheque is given, the possession of which entitles the holder to all the advantages of the institute, for so long a period as it is dated for."

It will thus be seen that the Soldiers' Institute is analagous to the Mechanics' Institute, and is calculated to effect much good by furnishing useful employment and the means of innocent recreation during leisure hours. We heartily wish success to the Portsmouth Institute, and should be glad to see a similar plan adopted in other towns. The country would thus in some measure repay that debt which she owes to our brave soldiers.

Borough of Newport Annual Licensing-day.— The Mayor and Abraham Clarke, esq. sat on Monday for granting licenses to public-houses. Most of the renewals passed without observation, but on Robert Dyer applying for a license for the Old King's Arms, the Mayor made some strong observations on the general conduct and character or the house, stating that unless it was better conducted, the license would be refused next year. He said that observations had been made at the last meeting of the Town Council against the house, and the magistrates felt that they had a duty to perform to the public to prevent the annoyance to the neighbourhood, occasioned by bad and dissolute characters resorting to the house.

The applicant observed, that Mr. John Dyer had better put the saddle on himself, rather than accuse him, as his houses were the worst, being let to prostitutes.

Mr. John Dyer said he had given the parties notice to quit, and that he would see the notice enforced.

The Mayor said it was not a mere question whether prostitution was carried on in the house, for if bad characters were allowed to resort to them, and entice soldiers and others to accompany them, it was not observing the terms of the license.

Mr. Clarke observed that the words or the license were, that he should not allow idle and disorderly persons to assemble and meet together in his house. The magistrates had a duty to perform to the public, and they must enforce the law.

Mr. William Mew made some observations on the remarks made in the Town Council, and thought that the remarks made on the police, and on the Old King's Arms, neither truthful or just.

The Mayor, in granting the licenses of the Valient Soldier, and Tontine Tap, gave a similar caution to the applicants.

Newport Petty Sessions

Saturday—Before Sir H. P. Gordon, Bart, (chairman), A. J. Hambrough, Esq., and T. Cooke, Esq. 

Rebecca Smith, a common prostitute, was charged by William Stevens with stealing his coat.

It appeared that the complainant went into field to fight with another man and the defendant held his coat for him and he had never seen it since, but there being no proof against the prisoner that she stole the coat she was discharged in this case, but was then charged with stealing a book, " Light Hearts and Happy Days," from the shop of Mr. Frank Etheridge.

Mr. Etheridge deposed to having seen the book produced in his shop about a week since, and swore to its being his property by the private mark he had written in it and by his own stamp, which was in the book.

William Bolton, an acting corporal the Rifle Brigade, said that last Monday evening he met the prisoner in the barrack-yard Parkhurst, and that she went into his room with him and another man, and from thence into the canteen, where she showed him the book now produced and asked him if he would like to read it, and when they left the canteen she gave it to him, and he said he would return it to her the next evening, but the next morning he gave it to the pay Serjeant, who, in his presence, gave it to the police constable now present.

P.C. Purchase, being sworn, said—I apprehended the prisoner last Monday night about quarter to 10 o'clock, on Hunny-hill, on the charge of stealing a coat, handkerchief, and some money, belonging to William Stevens. I asked her where the red-cover book was that she had been reading that day, and she said she returned it to its owner. I asked her who that was and she said, you have got that to find out, but she afterwards told me that it belonged to a soldier. The next morning I went to the barracks and obtained the book of a serjeant in the presence of the last witness. I saw the prisoner the same day, and asked her where she got it from but she did not say. I took her to Mr. Etheridge's shop this morning, as she had told me she had bought a pennyworth of paper and an envelope there, to see if they (Mr. Etheridge, his wife, and daughter, who served the shop) knew her, and when there I said to her, where was the book, on the glass case or with those books (some that were together on the counter) you can tell me or leave it alone, it will neither make it better worse. She said, I took it off the glass case.

The prisoner had nothing to say in defence, and she was committed to the Sessions.

It appeared that she had also been committed on the Wednesday previous for stealing a memorandum book from Mr. John Mew's shop.


[TH: a certain Rebecca Smith also appears several times in County Sessions at Winchester charged with theft from various persons on the Island. The following tragic tale appeared next.]

An inquest was held at the Medina-inn, on the 17th inst., before F. Blake, Esq., coroner, on the body of a new-born female child.

Joseph Read, being sworn, said— I live in Quaystreet, Newport. Yesterday afternoon, about 3 o'clock, I was coming from the Grove into Newport. My attention was directed to something in the stream near Sea-street. I got it out, and found it was the body of a child—the body which has now been viewed by the jury. It was tied up in part of the lining of a gown, and part of a brick was also enclosed. It was tied in two knots, and pinned at the edges. The lining and brick are now produced. The brick was not near the head of the child. It was a female child. I observed a bruise on the fore head. It was near Mr. Hallett's coal wharf. I delivered the body to Mr. Cross, the landlord of the Medina inn, Newport. The brick was clear of the body, hung in the string the bundle.

Thomas Denness was next examined, and said— Yesterday afternoon, about one o'clock, I saw bundle tied up and pinned. It resembled the wrapper now produced. It was near the hatch of St. Cross' mill. That was about 300 yards from the place described by the last witness. I tried to reach it, and touched it with my foot. On my touching it, it fell over the hatch. It fell heavy. It was then high water. It must have fallen seven or eight feet—probably two feet of water when it fell.

Mr. Robert Horlock, surgeon, then said— I first saw the body of deceased about four o'clock yesterday afternoon. I examined the forehead and found it had a dark appearance, and there appeared to be extravasted blood beneath the scalp. The face was also a great deal discoloured. The left arm was lying across the upper part the chest, and the flesh of the arm quite flattened. An impression upon the chest where the arm had been lying across the body. The right arm in a flexed position. The umbilical cord had been divided close to the navel, apparently with an instrument, either scissors or a knife; but no ligature had been applied. A medical man or a midwife would have applied a ligature. The legs and thighs were also flexed and flattened. I think the body must have been tied up in the bundle while warm. There was eccleymosis of the blood-vessels on the arms and thighs, which prove that circulation had taken place after delivery. It was a full-grown female child. I should say that it had been dead more than a week—between a week and a fortnight. Decomposition had commenced on the surface. On turning the body over, I observed a good deal of crepitation under the left shoulder. I afterwards made an internal examination of the body. On opening the chest, I found the lungs and heart perfectly healthy. The vessels on the right of the heart, and the pulmonary vessels were much congested. The lungs appeared red and healthy ; and on making an incision into the lungs, blood flowed. It crepitated to the touch. I have not the slightest doubt that the child was born alive. I put a portion of the lungs into water, and they floated. The stomach was perfectly empty. The child had never taken food. The bladder was also empty, which showed that the child must have passed water after its birth. I then removed the scalp ; and underneath the scalp, on the right and upper side of the forehead, over the frontal bone, there was considerable quantity of extravasated blood. No extravasation under the other portion of the scalp. There is a membrane which covers the bone, (called the pericranium) and there was extravasated blood between that membrane and the bone. The place of the extravasation corresponded with the black appearance in the forehead; and I should think it was occasioned by a blow from a blunt instrument, as it did not cause any wound. On opening the head, I found the membrane of the brain a good deal congested, more particularly underneath the frontal bone, corresponding with the extravasation externally. That might have arisen from the same injury. The injuries which I found in the head, were sufficient to have caused death ; and I consider they must have been inflicted while the child was alive. It was a very fine child, and I could find nothing to account for its death from natural causes. If the mother had been delivered while standing, and the child had fallen on a stone floor, it is possible, though not probable, that it may have sustained injuries such as I have described. The injury might have been occasioned either from heavy fall a hard floor, or from a blow from a blunt or flat instrument.

Verdict,— " The deceased was found dead, and that death was occasioned by injuries received on the head, but no sufficient evidence to shew whether the injuries were inflicted wilfully or accidentally."

BOROUGH SESSIONS. Monday.—Before R. M. Wavell, Esq., E. Way, Esq., and Percy Scott, Esq.

George Downer was charged with using indecent language in the street. He did not appear. (Mr. Way being a witness in the case did not occupy his seat on the bench during its hearing.) P.C. Hobbs proved to having served the summons on Downer, and Mr. Way said—A few minutes before 9 o'clock on Saturday night, as I was going from my house into the High-street, I heard a great noise, and on getting near where it was I saw Downer pushing woman about and using very indecent language. I told him such language was not allowed to be used in the street, and if he did not home quietly I should find another place for him. He asked me who I was ? I told him a magistrate of the borough, and that it was my duty not to allow such conduct. He then came towards me with the stick I now produce (about 36 inches long and 10 inches round) and threatened to strike me, and made use of similar language to me that he had been doing to the woman. I thought he would have struck me, but he did not. I fancied he had been drinking. I went away down the High-street to fetch a constable, and met Mr. Roach, who had heard what passed, coming with one.

P.S. Grapes said the defendant had been once before for assaulting the police.

A warrant was issued for his apprehension.

...

Honora Dunn was charged by Hannah Pursell with an assault.

The complainant said—I live in the Tontine yard. Am the wife of James Purcell, a labouring man. This woman's master, my husband, and myself, were coming down street last Monday evening, and she run again us in the street, and begun bating her husband for being in such bad characters as my husband and I was sir; and she kept on at him all up the yard until she came to her place, and I asked her if we was'nt good company enough for her husband; and she said, no. I asked her, why; because, she said, I was a whore. I told her to mind her words, sir, for I'd make her prove whether I was one; and she said, she would, I was a nasty drunken whore, sir. Mr. Hobbs here, was present sir and so was another gal, and heard the first and last of it.

Mr. Blake: Did she strike you ?

Complainant: No, sir, she didn't strike me, but she called me a whore.

Mr. Blake: But you summoned her for an assault ?

Complainant: Well, sir, she insulted me by calling me a whore.

Mr. Blake: But that is not an assault.

P.C. Hobbs said, no blows were struck, but there was a good deal of talking between them.

The magistrates recommended them to use better language towards each other, and live more peaceably as neighbours, and dismissed the case.

Abraham Rackett was charged by P.C. Lockhart with making a great noise in Quay Street, on Friday night, and disturbing the inhabitants. The prisoner said he was sorry for it, he had some drink in him. Fined 5s. and 5s. costs, and in default of payment was committed for 10 days.

Isle of Wight Observer - Saturday 10 June 1854

NEWPORT PETTY SESSIONS.

Saturday.—Before Rev. R. W. White, chairman ; Sir H. P. Gordon, Bart., Sir John Simeon, Bart., Hon. W. aCourt Holmes, and A. J. Hambrough.

George Lang and Charles King, the two privates of the 93rd regiment, who were remanded from Thursday last for breaking into the Riding School at Parkhurst barracks, and stealing therefrom several articles from the baggage which was stored away there, were again brought forward.

Richard Gough, color sergeant of the 77th depot, stationed at Parkhurst, was first examined, and said— I do not know either of the prisoners. Part of the articles now produced were my charge. On Tuesday morning last, having heard of a robbery being committed in the riding school at the barracks, I immediately went to see if any of the packages that were left in charge by Colonel Graham Egerton, of the 77th regiment, on his leaving England with the regiment for Constantinople, were disturbed. I found that a bed vellese had been opened and a buffalo's skin, a pair of blankets, bolster, two feather pillows, pilot jacket, and a polka cloak had been taken out of it. About the 17th ult. I had the vellese taken to my quarters to be aired. I saw it unpacked, and afterwards packed the things in myself. It was taken back to the riding school on the 23rd. It was fastened by buckles, and not locked. It was never opened at my quarters after I packed it. I know it was full when taken back to the riding school, because it took two men to carry it. The riding school is not locked during the day, but whether it is at night I am not aware. On the 24th I put my hand inside the package to see if the things were all right, and found that they were. On coming from church to the parade ground we had to pass through the riding school to get to the parade ground. When I came out of church last Sunday I turned round and looked at the vellese and saw that it was quite tight, and just as had previously left it. All the things I have mentioned, except the pilot jacket which is not here, are those now produced. I believe there were other packages broken open belonging to the 95th regiment, but I only had charge of those of the 93rd.

Elizabeth Sterrett, a common prostitute, living in the Tontine yard, Cosham-street `[the original name of South Street]`, Newport, was next examined, and said—On Tuesday morning last, about half-past seven, the prisoner Charles King brought to my house a bundle tied or rolled up in something black like a coat or cloak. He said he found it, and asked me to let it stop at my house a bit. I said yes. He did not open it, nor did I. He took it upstairs into my bedroom. He came down stairs again, and remained there till the police constable came, about ten o'clock the same morning. He gave no account of where he got it. A girl from Portsmouth was having some breakfast with me when he came. I left them together in my house and went across the yard to the public house, and whilst there the policeman came and asked me if knew Charles King, and I said yes. He said, where is he. I said in my house. He asked me if he had brought a bundle. I said yes. I told him to go in and look for it. I told him to go up stairs. I went with him. King was in the house, concealed in the cupboard. The policeman brought down the bundle and opened it in my presence. There were four articles in it; a blanket, pillow, cloak, and pair of boots. I cannot swear that those now produced were the articles the policeman took away. I have not seen the prisoner Lang since somewhen last week. I saw King at the Tontine public house about seven or eight on Monday evening.

Jane Lock, another of those unfortunate girls, living in the same yard as the last witness, said— I know the prisoners. I saw King on Monday night. On Tuesday morning, about half-past seven, I saw him in the Tontine yard. I was in a neighbour's house the time. When I went into my own house, I saw some things there. It was about half-an-hour before I went to my own house. I did not see King away, or what become of him. When I went up stairs I saw a blanket and pillow had been put on my bed, and when I came down stairs again and looked in the cupboard, I found some wet shirts and a sheet. The blanket and pillow were laid loose on the bed as if they belonged to the bed. I am sure they were not there when I left the house. Just after I found these things my house King came in, and I asked him if he had brought the things and put them where I found them. He said, yes. I begged him to take them away. He said he would presently. He had nothing else with him. I then went out and King followed. I went across the yard. I returned in about ten minutes and found the pillow was gone. King was then in Elizabeth Sterritt's. I went into him and asked him if he had taken the pillow. He said, yes. I said to him, I wish you would come and take the rest away. He said he was going home bye-and-bye and he would take them with him. Whilst I was talking to Mrs. Sterritt P.C. Hobbs and the picquet came up the yard. The policeman took charge of the things and carried them away. I did not see anything of Lang.

P.C. Hobbs deposed to having gone with P.C. Purchase in search of the prisoner King, and to having found, at the witness Lock's house, four wet shirts, a wet sheet, and blanket, which he produced; and that he afterwards went to the barracks with Purchase, who took from Lang's foot a shoe and compared it with some footmarks in a garden adjoining the riding school, through which the prisoners must have have passed with the things to get from the barracks unseen, and which marks corresponded exactly with Lang's shoe.

P.C. Purchase was next examined, and said— In consequence of information I received on Tuesday morning last, I went to the barracks and received from Sergeant Gough a list of some things that had been stolen. I then went into the riding school and through a door at the side leading into little garden, where I saw some footmarks. There was another door in the garden which led into the summer parade field. Some new buildings had been erected near the garden, and the clay from the foundation had been thrown into the garden which, being quite soft, made the footmarks very plain. There were the marks of the feet of two men in the direction of the field from the door. I got some stones and covered up some of the plainest of the tracks. I then went to the Sergeant Major and asked him if there were any men absent last night. He said, Charles was. I then came into Newport, and went into the Tontine yard with P.C. Hobbs—four soldiers came down with me. I went into the witness Sterritt's house and went up stairs, and received from her a blanket, a polka cloak, pair of boots, and a coat. She said, King had brought them there. I now produce the things. I then came down stairs and apprehended King; he was concealed in a cupboard. I told him I should take him into custody for stealing those things from the riding school. He said, then you'll take me for what I haven't done. As I was coming to the station house with him custody, I said him, how do you account for having those things in your possession? He said, I found them on the side of the road between the barracks and the toll-gate. I asked him, when ? He said, last night, just after nine o'clock, when I was going to the barracks, just after the first tattoo, I picked them and brought them into the town; I was late, and I stopped absent.

From further information I received, I went to the barracks again in the afternoon with Hobbs. I went to Lang's quarters where he was, and told him I must have his shoes to compare with some footmarks. He took them off. I then went to the garden and compared them with the footmarks there, and they corresponded exactly. I now produce the shoes. I then went back to Lang's quarters and took him into custody. The buffalo skin and the other pillow were found in the field.

This being all the evidence there was against Lang the magistrates thought it insufficient, and discharged him.

Adam Mc'Pherson, sergeant of the 93rd Regiment, said— I know the prisoner King. I have known him for eight years. I was on duty on Monday night, and he was reported absent from tattoo. I remained on duty till Tuesday afternoon two o'clock ; during which time he did not come to the barracks. On Sunday and Monday he was on duty as sentry at the riding school, which gave him an opportunity of seeing what was there. Sometimes the door of the riding school is not locked at night. During the night of the 29th ult., about twelve o'clock, the sentry at that post reported that some one had broken into the riding school. In consequence of which I went over, and discovered the side door which leads into the garden open. I saw the top partly off one box and the things in a ruffled state. That box belonged to the 77th Regiment. The baggage of five different Regiments was there. A box belonging to the 95th had also been disturbed.

The prisoner said, I am guilty of having the things, but not of taking them. I found them on the road-side. I never looked to see what they were; if I had known what they were, I would have had nothing to do with them.

Committed to the Sessions.

The prisoner was then charged with and committed for stealing the shirts from the washhouse at the barracks, they being identified by the woman who was washing them the day before.

BOROUGH COURT. Monday.— Magistrates present : T. Cooke, and Edward Way, esqrs.

FEMALE JUVENILE DEPRAVITY.

Caroline Pierce and Ellen Pierce, two girls of the town, were charged with loitering in the High-street, on Wednesday night, at half-past twelve, for an improper purpose. Police-constable Hobbs said that he saw several girls there on the occasion, among whom were Caroline Pierce and, he believed, Ellen Pierce, but was not certain. He went towards the girls, when they passed through the Corn Market and stood under the Mechanics' Institution. He made towards them again, and they then moved towards the Green Dragon-yard. Caroline Pierce and another came back; the other girls went in different directions. He ordered them to go home, but instead of doing so, they went into the High-street. They were constantly in the High-street, and he had seen them speak to gentlemen, and go away with them. They were generally quiet, but the street swarms with girls of that description.— Police-constable Grapes said the girls were continually in the street at an improper hour.— Ellen said she was not in the High-street at all, and Caroline said she had been to a party at the Beehive, and only went into Cosham-street `[the original name of South Street]` with her companions, who lived there, and she was going home when she met police-constable Hobbs. It should never occur again, and she was very sorry it had now happened.— Mr. Cooke said he had no doubt but that Ellen was as profligate as her sister, and warned them and other girls in Court about strolling the streets at night.— Caroline was fined 10s, and 5s costs, which she paid immediately.

Joseph Anderson, of the Crab and Lobster publichouse, was charged with keeping his house open for the sale of beer after 10 o'clock on Sunday night, the 24th ult.

P.C. Lockhart said— I went to the defendant's house in company with P.C. Cave at twenty minutes to 11 on the night in question and heard persons in the house. I stopped at the front door and Cave went to the back door. Cave knocked at the back door and some one asked who it was, and he said, the police. The person did not open the door but went back again into the house. I heard a scuffle in the house afterwards. I rapped several times at the front door, and I heard the defendant say to a boy inside, Why don't you open the door or go and see who it is. A female made reply and said, you know who it is, it is the police. The defendant then came to the door and asked who it was. I told him, the police. He opened the door, and I asked him who he had in his house. He said, no one. I told him he had for I heard them. He again said he had no one; he would not do anything against the law if he knew it, for ever so. I went to the back door and let Cave in. We searched the house and found two men in a cupboard in the back room, two in the coal hole and in the yard, one the water closet. There were cups the sideboard that had been used for beer, and there was a quart cup and a glass half-full of beer in the other room. I told him I must report him. He said he hoped I should not.

In defence, Anderson said no beer had been drawn since ten minutes before 10 o'clock; but, of course, such an excuse would not satisfy the magistrates, and they fined him 20s. and 5s. costs.

Sarah Crib, an elderly woman, was charged with making use of obscene and indecent language in Brewhouse-yard, Sea-street, to Eliza Angel (a rather dark one.)

The complainant, on being sworn, said—On Thursday week Mrs. Crib and Jane Mc'Custom was having a few words to themselves in their door in Brewhouse-yard, and Mrs. Mc'Custom asked her what she meant by calling her a w————, and Mrs. Crib's daughter came out with a saucer full of tea and sop and threw it at Mrs. Mc'Custom's face. Mrs. Crib then turned round to me and said, you b————, I'll do for you. I had not spoken to her at all. I then asked her what she could do ? and she said, you go and take that counterpane back to Mr. Mew's farm which I could swear you stole. I took one of the neighbours with me and went to Mr. Mew's. I asked Mrs. Mew if she could swear to the counterpane ? and she said it was not her's. I asked Mrs. Crib to go with me, but she would not. When I came back I told her I had been, and she abused me shamefully. I did not go to her house at all. She called me other disgusting names. She did not strike me.

This disgusting evidence was confirmed by Mrs. Mc'Custom and Mrs. Whitmaich, and not denied by the defendant, but she said the complainant used as bad.

She was fined 5s. and 5s. costs, and if not paid in a week to be committed for 14 days.

BOROUGH COURT

MONDAY — Magistrates present: Dr. Wavell and Edward Way, esqrs.

SOLDIERS" SPREE.

Joseph Bailey, William Campbell, John Beadlestone, and Thomas Lyons, privates in the Sth Regiment, were charged with breaking into a house in Tontine-yard. (Most of the tenements in this den are inhabited by persons of ill-fame, and the general resort of the soldiery).

Elisabeth Sterrett said she lived in Tontine-yard, and was a widow. At about three o'clock in the morning on Sunday week she was in bed and heard a kicking at the door, and then heard a shutter broken open and one or two panes of glass break. When she had got a light four soldiers walked up to her room. Campbell was the first that came in. Beadlestone was another. She did not know the other two. Campbell said "Blood this night I'll have," and tried to tear her night clothes off her. Witness screeched " Murder!" and they went down stairs— she *threw* one down. Went down stairs and found four more— Lyons was one ; did not know the other ; they all got out through the window, and one of them said, " Campbell, smash some more windows," and they smashed several. There were eight panes broken—cost 8d a pane. Witness paid 8d for a bolt to fasten the shutters; the table was broken all to pieces, worth 4s. Witness did not miss anything, and they did not offer her any violence ; she was only frightened. Campbell struck her before the officers, when she was picking them out.

Ann Philips said she lived in Tontine Yard ; heard Sterrett call " murder," looked out of window and saw the soldiers break the window with a stick ; saw they belonged to the 4th Regiment, did not know any of them, there were eight or nine.

P. C. Hobbs said that on the night of last Saturday week, he saw several soldiers come from Tontine Yard, proceeded there and saw the windows of Sterrett's house were broken. Knew Lyons and Campbell in the party, but could not identify the others.

Lyons, in defence, said he never was near the place.

Beadlestone said he was not in the streets— was not with this party all night.

Campbell was " not there at all at all."

Beadlestone called John Windgate, a private in the 8th, who said he was out of the barracks that night in a state of intoxication, and had been to sleep near a mill. When he awoke about daybreak he saw Beadlestone was there. Had not seen him before, and did not know where he had been in the night.

Bailey was discharged. The others were fined 10s and 3s 6d costs each, and, in default, committed to Winchester for one month.

BOROUGH SESSIONS.

Monday.— Before C. W. Estcourt, Esq., mayor; and E. Way, Esq.

Joseph Anderson, of the " Crab and Lobster" beer shop, was charged with keeping his house open for the sale of beer after the time allowed by law, and secreting soldiers at such times.

P.C. Cave, said — I went to defendant's house about half-past 11 o'clock on Monday night, the 19th of February, with the picket, in search of absent soldiers. I was admitted, and defendant's wife said no soldiers were there. Defendant was present. I went to the coal hole door and found it tied inside. I broke the string, and found a soldier concealed in the corner of the coal hole. I asked defendant and his wife if they had any more in the house, and they said, no. I then went up stairs and found two girls sitting by the fire, and two soldiers lying under the bed.

P.C. Hobbs, said—I went to the defendant's house with the picket, on the night of the 19th of February, at about half-past 10 o'clock, and found three soldiers in the kitchen. The picket took them away, and when they got to Nodehill they escaped from the picket. I went back to the house about half-past 11 o'clock with the last witness. P.C. Cave asked if there were absent soldiers there, and Mrs. Anderson denied that there were. We found one soldier tied in the coal hole, and two up stairs. They were the same three soldiers who had been taken from the house. On Sunday last, about 12 o'clock at night, I went to defendant's house, and saw a soldier in the kitchen. I asked the defendant's wife if there were any more. She said, no. I then went up stairs and found soldier bed with a common prostitute. There were two other prostitutes on the second floor, and two men with them. I believe one of the women was a lodger, but not the other women nor the men. I then came down stairs, and Mrs. Anderson let another soldier out of the back door. There are great complaints of the house from the neighbours.

The defendant was fined £2, and 5s. costs, and in default of payment committed to the house of correction for a month.

BOROUGH SESSIONS. Monday.—Before C. W. Estcourt, Esq., mayor ; E. Way, and W. M. Wavell, Esqrs.

Joseph Rands, shoemaker, was summoned by Rosa Jager for using profane and obscene language to her.

Mr. Beckingsale appeared for the defendant, and contended that the magistrates had no jurisdiction in the matter; for, even admitting that the language complained of had been used, it was in the defendant's own house, and neither the Act or the By-Law authorised them to interfere with any man for making use of such language in his own house.

The magistrates did not agree with Mr. Beckingsale that his arguments applied to the present ease, as it occurred in the front shop, which was a public place, and it was not a private quarrel in the family.

The complainant then said—I am the wife of August Jager, a German. Mv husband works for Mr. Rands. Last Thursday week I took some work home to Mr. Rands' shop, and went in three times for the money, He said he had no change and could not pay me, and abused me. I told him my husband wanted the money.

Cross-examined by Mr. Beckingsale—I work with my husband at the trade. We have been making slippers for Mr. Rands. He only paid 6d. for making a pair of slippers. [Mr. Rands : I give them 3s. a dozen more than they get in London.] He did complain to them bout a pair being made bad, but how could he expect them made better for sixpence ? He did not say he would not pay me till I got him the last my husband had that belonged to him. He said he had no change.

George Frederick Mills, a little boy, was then called by Mr. Beckingsale and stated that he was in the shop all three times when the complainant was there, and that Mr. Rands did not make use of any such language that mentioned the complainant. The case was then dismissed.

BOROUGH COURT

BOROUGH COURT. Monday.— Magistrates present : The Mayor (C. W. Estcourt), and R. M. Wavell. esqrs.

"Othello's Occupation Gone."— Joseph Anderson, the notorious occupier of the Crab and Lobster beer-shop (who is just out of Winchester Gaol), was again summoned, for " not being able to keep magistrates' hours," as he terms it.

Police-constable Hobbs stated that last Sunday week he went to the house of the defendant, at three o'clock in the afternoon, and found the front door open. There were between forty and fifty soldiers in the house, and some prostitutes; they were sitting about drinking beer. He went there with a piquet the other night, and they found six girls in bed.

Police constable Stubbs deposed that last Tuesday night, at half-past eleven, he caught about eight couple of men and women there. There were beer-cups on the table, and they were sitting down, listening to defendant singing, "John Anderson my Joe John." Stubbs remonstrated with him, and he merely remarked, that would make another charge against him.

Police-constable Cave proved the service of the summons. The man was not there, and his wife would not take it. She said her husband should not appear. He read the summons over, and put it down in the passage ; he then left. She ran after him, and told him he might light his pipe with it, &c., throwing the summons after him.

Mr. Inspector Grapes recited several cases of previous conviction. He was called in Court, but no one answered, and the Mayor then adjudged the defendant to be fined £20, the license of the house to be cancelled, and himself to be disqualified for selling beer for two years. In default of payment of the fine, to be committed to Winchester Gaol for two months.

Petty Sessions

Saturday.—Before Sir H. P. Gordon, Bart., Chairman ; Sir John Simeon, Bart.; Capt. Hamond, R.N.; Capt. Crozier, R.N.; and Thomas Cooke, Esq.

...

James Caffrey, a private in the 77th Regiment, servant to Philip Daucey, Esq., ensign, stationed at Parkhurst Garrison, was charged with stealing a coat, waistcoat, a gold enamelled ring, a gold pin, a set of gold shirt studs, set of coral studs set gold, a pair of gold and a pair of silver wrist studs, the property of his master.

Mr. Daucey, on being sworn, said —the prisoner was my servant and had access to my room and the charge of everything therein. On the 7th of May he left me, and after he had gone I looked over my things to see if anything had been taken, and I then missed the articles now named in the charge. They had all been taken from my drawer or from the mantle-piece. The drawer was not kept locked. I did not see any of the articles after I had missed them, until yesterday morning, when they were shown to me by the Sergeant of Police. The prisoner was absent from the barracks from Monday morning until the next Sunday morning, when he was brought in as a deserter. I can swear that the things now produced are those I lost.

Thomas Green, jun., chimney sweep at Newport, deposed to buying the coat of the prisoner for 2s. 6d. and an old coat.

Anne Jones, a common prostitute, living in Paradise-row, Newport, deposed to having received the ring from the prisoner and afterwards leaving it in the care of her landlady, Mrs. Leonard, who gave it up to the Police.

Elizabeth Pragnell, of the Oyster-shell houses, near Newport, said the prisoner came to her house in private clothes, with a girl, and asked to be allowed to stop there the night, which he did, and that he represented himself to belong to some ship about to be paid off at Portsmouth, and left with her the gold pin and studs for 15s., saying that he would take them again of her when he received his money.

P.S. Stannard then deposed to receiving the articles which he now produced of the several witnesses, and to taking the prisoner into custody. Committed to the sessions.

It having been proved by Mr. Grapes, inspector of police, that the defendant had been twice committed in this court for similar offences, he was fined and 7s. 6d. costs, and default of payment to be committed to the House of Correction, at Winchester, for a month, and to be disqualified from selling beer by retail for the space of two years next ensuing this conviction.

They were both on the pavement. Mr. Mew, the landlord of the Bugle came and requested me to remove them as they had dinner party who were very much annoyed by them. I spoke to defendant and requested him to go way. He said, "these gentlemen (pointing to three men in the Bugle') wish me to sing a song. I said, I had nothing to do with that and wished them to move on. Defendant looked to the men in the Bugle and asked them if they did not want him to sing a song. They made him no answer. Defendant began singing. I told him I should lock him up if he did sing, and he then went to the gentlemen and asked them to give him something. They said, you sing a song and I will. He then began singing and I took him into custody. In coming down the street he struck me with a fist and kicked me in my legs. He got his leg between mine and threw me. He pulled a quantity of hair out of my head with both his hands. He then got away. P.C. Lockhurst and I afterwards apprehended him in Cosham-street `[the original name of South Street]`.

A Batch of Disorderlies.— Edward Howes, the landlord of the Tontine, a notorious house in Cosham-street `[the original name of South Street]`, was charged with assaulting Ellen Cribb, by striking her, making her nose bleed, and also tearing her clothes. He was fined 5s. and costs.

The last complainant's sister, who gave her name as Rosannah Oates, wife of a Serjeant of the 44th Regiment, preferred a similar charge against the defendant Howes. She admitted that she just stepped into the house with a soldier when a whole lot of them were fighting, and just after she had left, and had got into the middle of the road, the defendant came out and struck her. He accused her, too, of belonging to the opposite shop, and getting the soldiers away from his house to the " Red, White, and Blue." He was once more fined 5s. and 5s. costs.

The above two girls were now in their turn charged by the police with an offence against the bye-laws, by using obscene language on the occasion of the assaults above referred to, and were fined 5s. each, without costs, which they paid.

Two disreputable girls, named Jane Dyer and Georgiana Lush, were charged by the police with being in the streets at midnight with several officers of the Garrison, laughing, hallooing, and romping with them. They were committed to Winchester Gaol for a fortnight, as idle and disorderly persons.

NEWPORT. COUNTY PETTY SESSIONS.

BOROUGH PETTY SESSIONS. MONDAY, JULY 11th, (Before R. M. Wavell, and E. Way, Esqrs.)

Timothy Mahony was brought up under remand, charged with administering some deleterious drug to Elizabeth Hurst, Edith Parsons, and Elizabeth Jackman, prostitutes, at the "Old King's Arms." From the evidence of the girls, and of Susan Munday, a witness, it appeared that on the previous Tuesday evening the prisoner and a sailor went into the house where they found the complainants—that four quarts of beer were had in and paid for by the sailor—that the prisoner was seen to put some powder into the cup—to pour it into the glass and to return it to the cup. The girls were taken ill with similar symptoms within half-an-hour, and Robert Henkel, Esq., Surgeon, who was called, deposed that beer could not have the effects which he observed, and he had no doubt the symptoms were caused by some drug mixed in the ale.—Mr. G. P. Joyce appeared for the prisoner, and pressed for an adjournment, or justice would be denied to his client, as the assizes were then commenced, and there was not time to get up a defence.—Committed for trial at the assizes. The bill was ignored by the Grand Jury as far as poisoning was concerned, and one found for an assault, which Sergeant Chennell, who tried the prisoner, ruled was untenable,—he was therefore discharged.

BOROUGH POLICE COURT, TUESDAY, JULY (Before the Mayor and R. M. Wavell, Esq.)

Caroline Pierce and Caroline Sibley, two prostitutes, were charged by Lieut. Davey, of the 1st Royals, with stealing a carbuncle gold pin from his person, on Monday night, at the Rose and Crown. It appeared that the prisoners and prosecutor were in company, and one, if not both girls, sat on his knees. He missed the pin soon after, but did not see either of them take it, and it was not found.—The case was dismissed.

NEWPORT

ISLE OF WIGHT PETTY SESSIONS.

BOROUGH COURT. Monday.— Magistrates present: Dr. Wavell, and E. Way,

A serious charge of extensive drugging was last week preferred against an Irish coal-heaver, living in the Tontine yard, in this town, named Patrick Murphy, alias Timothy Mahoney, the particulars of which were miscarried last week. The case, however, was remanded to this day, for further evidence.

Elizabeth Hurst, a common prostitute, stated that she was in the tap-room of the Adam and Eve, in Pyle-street, on the previous Tuesday evening, when the prisoner and two other men came in, between eight and nine, and had two quarts of ale, to which they treated her and some other girls. On a third quart coming in, the prisoner put his hand into his pocket and pulled out some-thing which he threw into the cup, pouring out a glass full of ale, and re-mixing it; after which he put it to hie mouth, but did not appear to drink any, neither did the other men partake of it. He poured out glasses, and four out of the seven present partook of it, the same as they had from the former quarts ; but the other three would not drink, because they said they thought he had put some-thing into it. He said he had not, and put some into his own mouth, but spat it out again, and laughed. Witness drank two glasses of that quart, and the prisoner went for another himself, and brought it in to the room, the waitress following him, saying she saw him shake something into it out of a paper. Witness found no difference in the taste of the beer, and partook of that likewise, as did also Edith Parsons, Elisabeth Jackman, and Sally Coster. The prisoner and other men soon after went away, laughing, and Coster threw the remainder of the beer away, because the other girls should drink no more of it. In a short time witness was seized with vomiting and diarrhoea, and such violent pains in the stomach that she was quite doubled up. Her body was also swollen, and her stays were obliged to be unlaced. Parsons and Jackman were also taken similarly ill about the same time, but Coster was not so bad, as she had only tasted a little of the beer. They were obliged to send for Dr. Horlock, who administered two draughts to each of them, and they ultimately got the better of it. Complainant said that she suffered most, as she drank more than the other girls — (she was too ill to stand in the box, and her eyes appeared swollen). Her throat, she said, was hot as fire when she vomited.

The prisoner here said that he only pretended to put something in the beer, saying to the men present, " See me have a lark with these girls," and it was that which frightened them.

The complainant positively assured the Bench she did see him put something into the cup, but he did it so quickly that she could not tell what it was ; and, besides, he forced her to take the beer, holding one glass so tightly to her mouth that he would not take it away until he had made her swallow every drop.

Edith Parsons gave similar evidence. She discontinued drinking after receiving the caution from the waitress, and was shortly afterwards seized with the same illness as the last complainant.

The Court said this was a serious charge of administering some deleterious drug to these females, with the intent of inflicting bodily injury, and if proved against him, even if it was only a joke, it was a most creel and dangerous one, and they must remand the case.

The matter was subsequently before the Court, and the prisoner was committed for trial at the Winchester Assizes, where, it will be seen by our report, the indictment was quashed, and the accused dismissed with a cautionary admonition. Under these circumstances, and in reference to the crowded state of our columns, we have omitted a portion of the report forwarded from Newport.

On Tuesday (before the Mayor, and R. M. Wavell, esq.), two of the elite of the Newport pave, named Caroline Pierce and Caroline Bartlett, were charged with feloniously stealing a gold pin from the person of William Davey, an ensign of the 1st Royal. It appeared that he and two other officers were in the bar of a public-house in the town, with half-a-dozen girls, about eleven o'clock the previous night, and no doubt some of them endeavoured to abstract the pin (which wad a valuable one— a carbuncle, with a gold twist round it.) from his scarf, as the two girls and himself were "very gracious" while there,— till he put his hand up to his " choker," and found the pin *non est.* when it was " all t'other." He did not, however, see them take it, and the police were sent for, who searched for it, but it could not be found; and it seemed foolish to bring the charges before the Magistrates, under such circumstances. Of course the girls were discharged.

Hampshire Chronicle - Saturday 19 July 1856

HAMPSHIRE SUMMER ASSIZES

DRUGGING.

Timothy Mahoney was indicted for assaulting Elizabeth Hurst, at Newport, on the 8th July, and occasioning her actual bodily harm. Mr. Poulden for the prosecution and Mr. Cooke for the prisoner. Mr. Poulden, in opening the prosecution, said the case was of a peculiar nature, though the conduct of the prisoner amounted in law to an assault. The prisoner was in company with two or three girls of questionable character at the King's Arms public-house, in Pyle-street, Newport, the 8th instant. The prisoner went into the room where the girls were and drank some beer with them. He ordered two quarts of beer in succession, from which the girls, at his invitation, partook. He then ordered a third quart, but before any of this was drank, the prisoner was seen to put something into the cup and pour out a glassful of the liquor and put it back again. He did this several times in order to mix the substance put in the beer. He then again invited the girls to drink, and they did so, but complained of the beer having a nasty taste. The prisoner soon after left, and he had not been gone but very short time when the girls, especially Hurst, became exceedingly sick and ill, suffering from burning and swelling of the stomach and other symptoms beyond all doubt caused by some deleterious substance put into the beer.

Before the examination of witnesses, Mr. Cooke, on behalf of the prisoner, took an objection to the indictment, and cited cases in support of his argument that the offence, if proved, was not even an assault at common law. By the act of last session referring to the administration of chloroform and other stupifying preparations for the purposes of enabling a felony to be committed, the party so offending was adjudged guilty of felony. In this case the allegation was not that the drug was administered in order to commit a felony, and the offence was not a felony, neither did it become common assault. The objection was allowed to stand over till the facts of the case had been heard in evidence.

The prosecutrix Hurst being examined, said the prisoner tasted the beer of the third quart brought in, but spat it out again. She also added that he called in a fourth quart and took it behind the door, after which he held a glassfull of the liquor to her lips until she had drank the whole of it. The prisoner also just tasted the last quart of ale, but spat it out of his mouth and went away laughing. The waiter said the prisoner had put something in the beer, and told the girls not to drink any of it. The effects of the drink made the prosecutrix ill for two or three days. She was violently sick with burning in the throat and stomach, and her clothes were obliged to be loosed in consequence of her becoming much swollen. She said she saw the prisoner put something in the third quart, but she did not at the time suspect it was anything that would cause them harm.

In reference to the legal objection, the learned Sergeant said it was clear that the prosecutrix had confidence in the prisoner, and drunk the mixture voluntarily; and considering the cases referred to him by the counsel for the defence, he was of opinion that the conduct of the prisoner, although he had been guilty of a very wicked act, did not amount to an assault at common law. The Judge then directed the Jury to return a verdict of Not Guilty. The prisoner was then cautioned by the Judge as to his future conduct, and discharged from custody.

HAMPSHIRE ASSIZES

A NOVEL KIND OF ASSAULT.

Timothy Mahoney was indicted for assaulting Elizabeth Hurst, at Newport, on the evening of the 8th of July. Mr. Poulden prosecuted, and Mr. Cooke defended the prisoner. The facts of the case are as follows :—

The prosecutrix and some other girl, were at the King's Arms Inn, Pyle-street, Newport, on the above evening, where they met the prisoner, who asked them to have something to drink. Accordingly some beer was produced, and before the prisoner gave it to them to drink he was observed to put something into it, and the women who drank it, among them the prosecutrix, were shortly after their draught taken ill with vomiting and a burning kind of feeling in the throat and stomach.

Mr. Cooke objected that the case was not legally one of assault, and cited several cases in support of his objection.

The learned Serjeant agreed with Mr. Cooke, and said that it was not a case of assault at Common Law unless the intent of administering the drug or noxious composition was proved. It clearly did not come within the statute unless the prosecution were prepared to show that some coercion was used to compel the prosecutrix to take the liquor, he could not see how an indictment for assault could be maintained. It would be better, perhaps, to hear what the prosecutrix had to say.

The prosecutrix was called, and stated the case as above, also that no force was used to get them to drink.

The case was quashed, and the prisoner discharged with a suitable caution.

Lost in the Snow.— Severe cold weather suddenly set in here the latter end of last week, accompanied with a considerable fall of snow ; and on Friday, Atwell, the Calborne postman, bad a narrow escape of perishing through its intensity. Not arriving with his mail-bag, which was due at Carisbrooke at six o'clock in the evening, Mr. Redstone, the Carisbrooke postmaster, and a neighbour named Jones, set off on the Calbourne road in search of him, and ultimately discovered him in a ditch, under a bank, benumbed, asleep with the cold, and covered with the drifting snow. He was conveyed home, and is recovering under the surgical aid of Mr. Tuttiett, surgeon.

ISLE OF WIGHT PETTY SESSIONS. COUNTY BENCH.

Saturday.— Magistrates present: Sir John Simeon, bart., Chairman, Captains Hamond, Crozier, and Duff, and Le Marchant Thomas, esq.

Charles Gosling, a private of the 96th depôt, stationed at Parkhurst Barracks, was charged by Colour Serjeant George Wolfe, the Pay Serjeant of the depot, with robbing him of a £5 note, a sovereign, and upwards of a pound principally in fourpenny-pieces. From his evidence, it appeared that the prisoner was employed by him as a kind of " batman" for general purposes. On Tuesday, the 25th instant, after taking from his box upwards of a pound to give a serjeant to pay some of his men, he locked the box containing the sum stolen in a bag, and secreted the key behind his looking-glass, when he left the barracks on leave for the night, the prisoner being in his quarters to do whatever was necessary ; and when he returned the next morning be found the bag and money had been abstracted from the box. The prisoner had no liberty to go to the box.

In answer to questions from the prisoner, the prosecutor said he did not ask him for any money before he left the barracks, neither did he say " There's the bag in the box." He never entrusted him with the key, neither did he say " There's the key behind the box, you can take what yon like." All that he said to him before he went away was, that he had given out some crime papers to a Serjeant.

Serjeant Jobn Platt, of the 96th  depôt, stated that he was in the same room with the prosecutor, and on the evening in question saw the prisoner go to the box of Serjeant Wolfe, open it, and take something out. There was only a fire-light, but he did it openly. His wife told him she had seen him go there before, so he thought it was all right. They spoke a word or two to each other in a general way. He had seen the prisoner in town between four and five that afternoon. He had the key then, and told him he was going home to get some " tin." Witness thought Serjeant Wolfe had sent him.

Catherine Platt, wife of the last witness, also deposed to seeing the prisoner unlock the box, and take something out ; she told her husband of the circumstance.

Cross-examined by the prisoner— Had seen money put there by the prosecutor. Did not see the prisoner take 5s out of a bag in the box, neither did she hear him make any remark about his doing so.

Timothy Donovan, a corporal of the 96th depôt, deposed to being in company with the prisoner at the Adam and Eve public-house, in Newport, on the night of the 26th of November. He ordered some porter, which he paid for in fourpenny-pieces, and said he had bought some boot-laces, and in pulling them out, he drew out at least half-a-dozen of fourpenny-pieces, which fell about the floor.

Elizabeth Hurst, a woman of loose character, stated that the prisoner was with her in the public-house in the evening, when he called for several quantities of porter and rum, which he paid for in fourpenny-pieces and sixpences. He left at " tattoo " time, and did not return till between ten and eleven, when he sat down by the side of another girl, named Parsons, and had some more rum. for which he gave a fourpenny-piece. They all after-wards went to her companion's lodgings, in Paradise-row, taking some rum with them.

Edith Parsons confirmed the last witness's statements.

Police-constable John Batley deposed that having received information of the robbery, and the prisoner having absconded from the barracks, he apprehended him in Newport on Thursday, and charged him with the robbery. He said he knew nothing of it, and inquired as to the amount missing. He told him upwards of £7. He replied, " That's all I want to know ; all the money I had was from a serjeant, to pay some of his bills in town." Witness searched him, and found four fourpenny-pieces only on him.

This closing the evidence, the prisoner said in defence that he was sorry he had had any connexion with the man. He had been making away with the money, and now he had to settle up his accounts he wanted to saddle his defalcations on his back. Not a day passed that he took a pound from his box, and broke out of the barracks at night to spend it, and that was more than he could afford to spend. He certainly did take 5s out of the bag, and that was all ; but the prosecutor had given him the key night after night. He had been fourteen years in the service, and was as innocent of intentionally defrauding as any gentleman on the Bench. They had not found the £5 note on him, and he should like the prosecutor to state what was the number of the note he said he had lost. After a short consultation, the Magistrates committed him to take his trial at the Assizes at Winchester, which commenced on Monday.

BOROUGH PETTY SESSIONS. (Monday. Dec. 29.—Before Edward Way, and j. H. Hearn, Esqrs.)

Female Debauchery.

A woman named Elizabeth Jackman, a prostitute, was brought up in custody, charged with being drunk in the public streets at midnight, on the previous Friday. The case was proved by PC. Stubbs, who stated that on Friday night, about half-past 12 o’clock, he saw the defendant in Paradise-row, and also in Pyle-street, in a state of intoxication. He desired her to go to her home, which was situate in Paradise-row, but she requested that she might be locked up. He again repeated the salutary advice to go home, but, after walking down Pyle-street, she returned to the officer a second time, and in accordance with her request, locked her up in the station-house.

The girl expressed contrition for her conduct, and, after duly admonishing her, the bench ordered her to be discharged.

BOROUGH PETTY SESSIONS. [Monday.— Before R. M. Wavell, and E. Scott, Esqrs.]

Felony.— Sarah Duffy, a woman of low character and depraved habits, was charged with stealing a piece of pork, of the value of two shillings and five pence, the property of William Lane, a labouring man residing at Arreton. It appears that the silly fellow had been drinking with the prisoner the "Tontine Tap" till midnight on Saturday last, and had with him a basket provisions for home, including a choice bit of pork for Sunday's dinner. When the tap was closed and they could get no more beer, he went with the fascinating Mistress Duffy—whose blandishments and charms he could not resist—to her house up the Tontine yard, and she had not much difficulty in persuading him to go back and try to get a pint of beer, and whilst he was gone she opened the lid of his basket, looked at the pork, approved both quantity and quality, and so took it to herself. When the unsuspecting William returned, both she and the pork were gone. He shouted at the foot of the stairs, but nobody answered, and so he went and informed the police; and the next day, P.C. Stubbs, in presence of Superintendent Stubbs, found the identical piece of pork concealed in her bed. Committed to one month's hard labour.

Prisoner pleaded guilty— 28 days to hard labour.

The case was dismissed.

BOROUGH PETTY SESSIONS. February 15th. Before the Worshipful the Mayor (in the chair), and E. Way, Esq.

M. WOODMORE v. W. GUMMON, 6th Regt.

Mary Woodmore, sworn— I am a single woman. I live in Scarrets-lane. Last Wednesday morning between 10 and 11 o’clock, I was at home in bed. I heard some one breaking open shutters. I got out of bed and looked out of the window, and saw it was the defendant. I asked what he wanted. He said he wanted to come in. I told him to go away. Between 11 and 12 on the same morning of the same day, I was in the Tontine Inn, Defendant came in and asked Eliza West who was there and who lives with me, and what she said. She said that we did not want him up there. He then struck her with his open hand in the face. I asked him why he did it. He then up with his fist and gave me a black eye. He afterwards said, "take care or I’ll give you more." He would have struck me again but he was prevented by Corporal Cox.

Cross-examined— Defendant did strike me, and tore my hat off my head.

John Chick, sworn— I live in Scarrot's-lane, and I was at the Tontine last Wednesday evening before defendant came in. He asked Eliza West what she had been saying about him, and struck her. Many Woodmore asked what he did it for. He immediately struck her, and gave her a black eye. He struck her twice. I am sure she had not a black eye before defendant struck her, but afterwards the eye was swollen.

Cross-examined— I do not live in the same house as the complainant. I have lived in the same house, but that was in another house. My mother takes the house in which Mary Woodmore lives.

Eliza West corroborated the above evidence.

Police-constable, W. H. Stubbs, sworn— I was sent for about 1 last Thursday morning to Scarrot's-lane. I met defendant on the road. He went back to complainants house with me. The girls were in bed. Woodmore complained of his abusing her and breaking the windows, and I took him into custody. Woodmore had a black eye.

Defence— I saw the girls crying, and asked them what they had been saying about me. I put one outside the door. I did not strike the complainant or either of the girls, Rosa Cribb gave complainant the black eye.

Convicted in the penalty 10s., and 5s. costs, or committed to the House of Correction for 21 days. The money was paid.

Henry Underwood was charged with assaulting George Coward.

Coward, sworn— I was coming up St. James-street last night, at 20 minutes to 11 o’clock, when this young man came across the road and struck me in the mouth. A person of the name of Salter was with him. They knocked me down and kicked me in the back. The defendant gave no reason for it.

Inspector G. Grapes, sworn— At 20 minutes to 11 o’clock, Coward came to me and said he had been knocked down. I went to Mr. Homan’s comer and saw the policeman, who told me that Underwood was the person who struck the prisoner. He was the worse for liquor.

P.C. Linnington, sworn—I was at the Waggon and Horses, in Crocker-street. I heard a noise at the corner, and Coward came up and said that this young man had struck him. He came up at the time and struck him again in the face. He was not very drunk, nor very sober.

Cross examined by defendant— When Coward came up to me you came and struck him.

Defence— There was a scuffle, and I went across the road and my hat was knocked off. I did not strike him.

Sarah Coster, sworn— I was in company with Elizabeth Jackman. I saw the defendant strike a girl named Duffey. She had said nothing to him. He first threw a stone at her and made her nose bleed.

BOROUGH COURT. Monday— Magistrates present: The Mayor, R. M. Wavell, and E. Way, esqrs.

George Coward charged Henry Underwood with striking him several times on Sunday night last, in Crocker-street. It appears he and others were drinking, and there were several skirmishes, and complainant, who was the least to blame, got most of the blows. Defendant declared he did not strike him at all, but P.C. Limington swore he struck him in bis presence, and he was fined 15s, including costs, which he paid.

The defendant, Henry Underwood, was now charged with striking three prostitutes, named Elizabeth Jackman, Ann Duffey, and Sarah Cosier. It appeared Coward was with them, and this caused the ill-feeling. He was mulcted in another 15s, which he also paid.

John Chick, a German, was charged with keeping a disorderly house and encouraging prostitution therein. P.C. Stubbs proved that on Sunday morning, the 6th inst., he went to the defendant's beershop, in the High-street, about quarter-past one, when he found in the parlour three of the band of the Limerick Militia, a serjeant, and a civilian. In the passage he found another civilian, lying drunk on the floor with a common prostitute by his side. In one bed-room which the landlady unlocked he found two civilians and two prostitutes, in another bed-room one civilian and one prostitute, two civilians in another room, and another prostitute down stairs, most of whom were well supplied with beer. Defendant said he went to bed at eleven o'clock, and knew nothing about the matter. The Court said his conduct had been disgraceful, and they should fine him in the penalty of 3l. and costs, cautioning him that if he ever came there again he would not be let off so easily.

The prisoners pleaded not guilty.—The Court discharged Moore, and sentenced Crayford to one month's imprisonment, with hard labor.

Isle of Wight Observer - Saturday 12 December 1868

FRIENDLESS AND FALLEN.

To the Editor of the Isle of Wight Observer.

Sir, —The influence happily exercised by the English press giving publicity to the operations of benevolent enterprises induces me to solicit your aid in pleading the cause of an institution designed to afford the relief so urgently needed for the unhappy victims of immorality. The public are already too well acquainted with one phase of this wide-spread and melancholy evil: a glance at every public thoroughfare at once acquaints the observer with it. Such a view, however, gives but a very imperfect representation all that involved in a life prostitution. The fallen woman is there recognised under circumstances which naturally excite but little sympathy. To be seen in her true state —when the woman is herself again—it is necessary to visit her in her miserable abode, which is seldom without some valued relic serving to remind her of the time when she was virtuous and happy, and to which she clings amid all her misery and wretchedness. It is then that hollowness and shame of the life of so-called gaiety is seen, as the unhappy victim of sin, shorn of her finery and false appearance, realises her position as an outcast! When the fever of excitement is lulled, and the calmness of solitude enforces reflection, I say she then realises her misery, and I speak advisedly. Few can understand the suffering an immoral life entails. Seven years is its average length, and into its brief span crowded painful and distressing experience. Fully seventy per cent, of the unhappy creatures who crowd our streets have suffered their first fall through the wiles of the betrayers, thus losing their characters and their means of livelihood through one false step. Abandoned in their fall, without friend or counsellor, they have descended grade by grade until they reached the lowest depth in the social scale. These poor victims of a sinful life have experienced trials which would excite pity in the hardest heart, could all their sufferings be told. Many are supporting illegitimate children out of the wage of unchasteness, whose morality they carefully watch over. It must not be supposed that the majority fell into the condition of outcasts without struggling to regain their former position of respectability. Many have been domestic servants, needlewomen, &c., and the cry that is continually heard is, "Who will now employ me without a character ?" " Now that I have fallen, who will receive me?" Many a poor girl cast out to struggle upon the streets for the want of a helping hand to aid in restoring her. The London Female Preventive and Reformatory Institution has laboured in full view of all the distressing incidents which a mission to the fallen can only reveal, and the promoters of the institution are impressed with the importance of further efforts for the rescue of this unhappy class of our fellow-creatures. Now, sir, the institution whose claims upon the sympathy of the benevolent public, with your permission, I fain would urge, has been instrumental in aiding no less than 2,6O5 friendless and fallen women since its establishment in 1857, and the committee rejoice that the liberality of the subscribers has thus enabled them not only to effect the moral restitution of the majority of that number, but also to eliminate from society such a large proportion of painful and destructive an element. The institution now supports seven distinct homes, the particulars and operations which are contained in a detailed report, which will be most gladly forwarded to any taking an interest the subject, or who would like to inspect the homes. At the opening of the present year the committee, having funds at their disposal, authorised the admission (on any day) of friendless and fallen females anxious to reform; they also determined (seeing how many unhappy victims are inveigled from foreign countries) to extend the benefits of the institution to all fitting applicants, irrespective of birth or creed, thus enlarging the basis of their operations, and limiting it only by the amount of funds placed at their disposal. During the present year 430 poor creatures have been admitted, and have partaken of the shelter of the homes; of that number 285 were fallen, and 145 were friendless young women. Unhappily, *five hundred applicants* had to be *refused* for want of means to provide further accommodation. When all the homes are full, no less than 3,000 meals per week have to be provided for the support of the inmates. And in order to meet these and other necessary expenses, the committee are entirely dependent upon the voluntary, and often daily, contributions of the benevolent public. Aided by the experience gained in past operations, the committee have carefully arranged the working of each home. Five are devoted to the reception of fallen women only, one for those who have never fallen from the path of virtue, and another for the reception of convalescent young women of good character leaving hospitals and asylums. To secure a discriminate selection from the applications in the latter ease, a qualified female attends the various hospitals, &c., in order to seek the most suitable candidates for admission. In addition to the above, the committee have established a Night Reception House (admitting neither tramps nor vagrants), the doors of which remain open *all night* to receive the fallen women weary of a life of so much suffering and reproach, the only qualification necessary being proof of a desire to forsake the sinful course. In this asylum, Christianlike and genial, though severely plain, of necessity it must be, 450 of the " fallen" gladly took temporary shelter, were lodged, fed, conversed with, and then referred to homes, or places of refuge for penitent and suffering humanity. It known that one-half of these have been arrested in their miserable career and saved from moral and spiritual destruction. Of the inmates of the homes generally, many are restored to their friends, others undergo a training which qualifies them for domestic or other service; many are assisted to emigrate, and all brought under the influence Godly instruction, in which the Gospel of salvation is placed plainly before them. And now, sir, our *funds are exhausted*, and an account of our stewardship ready to be rendered. The cold blasts of wintry nights are sending us importunate applicants who, in sorrow and contrition, plead for shelter and relief. Must they be *rejected*, " and find no place of repentance, though they seek it carefully and with tears?" I would again appeal to the rich to spare of their abundance to relieve the great cry of suffering which goes up to heaven from the stricken hearts of poor perishing " fallen" women. I would appeal to those in humble circumstances to give a mite, even in their poverty, to this blessed work, for from many a cottage home throughout the land has the poor girl come, who has been betrayed and cast out in this great city. Those who are neutral, both in possessions and sentiment towards this mission, I entreat to " come over and help us", that we may not mock with cold and hollow sympathy, destitute of the means necessary to provide relief and rescue, the many who so earnestly seek reclamation.

I am, Sir, your obedient servant,

E. W. THOMAS, Sed.  
200, Euston-road, London, N.W.
