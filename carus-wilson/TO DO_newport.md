Upon the Iſland. itſelf, ' beſides many pleaſant Villages and Hamlets, Gentlemen's Seats, &c. there are four or five Towns; three of which, viz. Newport, Yarmouth, and Newtown, the latter of which is much the oldeſt Burrough, ſend each two Members to Parliament. Of theſe, we ſhall only take a little Notice of Newport, the Capital, and a few of the Parts adJacent, — This Town is ſeated on a riſing Ground near the

il Centre of the whole Iſland; and to make it the more convenient for commercial Affairs, it has the navigable River Me. dina running cloſe to its Skirts, and emptying itſelf into the | Sea at four or five Miles Diſtance, at the Harbour of Cowes. At this Port there is a Cuſtom-houſe, at which many Caroli-

m and Palatine Ships uſually clear. In this River are takers: Abundance of flat Fiſh, and great Quantities of the fatteſt and beſt flavoured Oyſters in the Kingdom. The Aire of Newport! is: lightſome and pleaſant; and though the Town is ſituatedupon a gentle and agreeable Eminence, yet it is ſo ſheltered: by the Hills which encompaſs: it at about a Mile Diſtance. that the Cold is ſeldom felt to a Degree of Severity common to moſt other Places. The Streets are ſpacious, clean, and conſequently ſweet. Theſe were at firſt evidently laid ut upon a regular Plan, conſiſting chiefly of three long ones, ex-+ _ tending from Eaſt to Weſt, and as many croſſing them at right Angles. They have been lately new piteh'd, at a great Expence; the Foot · way on each Side: being elegantly paved and poſted off, which affords a very handſome Appearance, beſides the: Pleaſure of excellent Walking. The Buildings; tho few of them grand, are neat and handſome, ſo that few Places, we believe, are more frequently viſited wy er or with greater Satisfaction.

Here are two Markets weekly, though only: that on Satur-deys is worthy of Notice. The great Number of Waggons, drawn by ſtately Teams of Horſes, which are ſeen at this Market, muſt needs attract the Obſervation of a Stranger. There are ſaid to be two hundred of theſe of a Day, all laden with Corn for this Market, and which of Courſe, according to their uſual Lading, muſt contain fourteen or fifteen hundred Quarters of Grain. Moſt of this is bought up by the Merchants and their Agents, for foreign Markets, ſo that in the laſt Year” near twenty thouſand Quarters were exported from Cotes only. A great deal, indeed, both of their Barley and Wheat is manufactured amongſt themſelves, and ſent abroad in Flour, Malt, and Biſcuit, for the Navy, Ec. Though in ſome Artieles this Manufacture has greatly diminiſhed of late Years, ſince the Government have cauſed Mills and Ovens to be erected for naval Services.

Here is alſo expoſed: to Sale in this Market, a large and \ pleaſant Sample of the various other Productions of this fertile Spot. Their Poultry and Butter, in particular, are fo plentiful and good, that great Quantities of both are weekly bought

up for the Supply of Portſmouth, &c. and of the latter much is


124 The NATURAL HISTORY is barrelled for the Winter Conſumption, and exported to very diſtant Parts. The rural Inhabitants, which reſort in great Numbers to the Markets for Bufineſs, are of a remarkably ſound and healthful Complexion z and the Fair Sex are deſervedly eſteemed as ſome of the faireſt of their Species, About a Mile to the weſtward of this Town ſtands Cari/brooks Caſtle, which is ſeated upon a very exalted Eminence, overlooking a Village of the ſame Name. This was once a conſiderable Fortreſs, and is ſaid to have been built by VhHitgar, a Favourite of Cerdic, King of the Vg Saxons, to whom he gave the Iſland after having ſubdued it, as before noted. It was afterwards improved by Richard de Rivers, Earl of Devon, in the Reign of Henry I. and repaired by Queen Elizabeth; but it is now fallen into great Decay. Though the Hill upon which the Caſtle ſtands has few to exceed it for Height in the Iſland, yet it is plentifully ſupplied with Water, than which there is none better. It is drawn up from a Well of 72 Yards deep, by the Labour of an Aſs, which runs in a Wheel for that Purpoſe. Upon theſe, and ſome other Accounts, particularly its being famous for the Retention of State Priſoners, (the laſt of which was the unfortunate King Charles I.) this Fortreſs is ſtill viſits ed by Strangers, as a Piece of Antiquity well worth their Notice. | In ſh
