VENTNOR.

The Glorious first of June.—

This memorable anniversary has for many years been celebrated as the day on which the extra four horse coaches have started for the season to run in the Island, on which occasion a dinner has been given by the Coach proprietors to a select circle of supporters and friends. The 1st of June falling on a Sunday this year the festivity was postponed until the following day, Monday, and a most lovely day it was. Never could a ride upon the outside of an easy going stage coach be better appreciated, a fine team of four-in-hand, skilful and courteous driver, good sample of passengers, and fine weather were enough to put any man upon good terms with himself or fortune. The goodly party alighted at friend Bush's at the Marine Hotel, where the feast of reason and flow of all things good bad been from the onset provided. Mr. Mew, of the Bugle, Newport, presided; Mr. Rendall, of the Pier Hotel, Ryde, was Vice-President. About 30 guests sat down to the dinner, which was replete with every excellence of the season. "The wheels" were drank with the usual demonstrations of respect for their usefulness and capability, and the healths of President, Vice-President, Mr. Webb, sen., Mr. Bush, Mr. Lambert, Mr. Hale, followed, all which were done worthy justice to. "The Press" was not forgotten, and the health of Mr. Tibbitts was coupled with it, which was suitably acknowledged by the honoured representative of the great engine. "Absent friends" were also toasted, and some excellent singing and an Irish story of the raciest humour added to the harmony of the meeting. "Our next merry meeting," concluded the festivity, which we emphatically pronounce the most hospitable, and the best for enjoyment attend the whole year; it is always looked forward to with pleasure and reflected upon with satisfaction. We are gratified in adding that those friends who have so repeatedly partaken of the hospitality instanced above have formed themselves into a committee for returning the compliment inviting Messrs. Mew, Kendall, Bush, and the whole coaching interest in the Island to a return dinner, which will come off on Tuesday week, at Mr. Bush's new hotel, Ventnor, combining a housewarming for that esteemed host with the compliment paid to his co-partners in the welfare of "the wheels." It will be a bumper greeting.

Ventnor

In number of the *Observer* at the beginning of tha year, there was an article on the public conveyances from Portsmouth to Ryde and in the Isle of Wight generally. A great change has taken place during the first half of the present century! what the remaining half may produce will not speculate upon at present! one thing is most certain in this time of locomotion it will not do for the inhabitants of the Isle Wight to remain idle, but every possibly arrangement should be made for the covenience and comfort of the visitors who come to the Island. The communication from Portsmouth and Ryde to Ventnor is capable of a great improvement, for if a person from Portsmouth or Ryde wishes to go by coach to Ventnor the utmost time he has there is two hours. When the extra coaches, are put on for the summer season the following arrangement would be a great accomodation to both residents and visitors and would doubtless prove equally advantageous to the coach proprietors. In the first place the steamer should leave Portsmouth at 8 o'clock, instead of 8.45, and then coaches leave Ryde for Ventnor at 9.0, 12.15, 3.30, and 7.0; Ventnor for Ryde at 7.30, 10.0, 30, and 4 30. This would be a decided improvement and great convenience to the public.

Ventnor

If anything need be further advanced in the way of argument as to the necessity of an improved transit than what has already appeared in the columns of this paper, it is the careless and indifferent manner manifested at this season of the year by these concerned. Last century it was from four to five days from London to York, this century it is but the same number of hours; but is still the same last century in the Isle of Wight,— one coach per diem from Ventnor to Ryde doing the journey in three hours, starting from thence at 11 o'clock. But it will be urged by those concerned, that there is not sufficient passengers to warrant any better or quicker mode of conveyance being adopted at this season of the year. To this we reply, How is it possible people can travel when there is no facility of conveyance to travel by? Suppose, for instance, all the Railways were to reduce their transit to an equal ratio with the Ventnor coaches, we can well guess the result, more especially if they only ran first and second dsss trains, to start at mid-day. No one, surely, would travel, and Railways would decline. Last Christmas we recorded that we were shut out from the world for three days, whilst parcels goods, perishable or not, were detained at the instance of advertised daily conveyances, excepting Mr. Yelfs, who sent on the parcels on Christmas day; in short, the mode in which the inhabitants of the Undercliff are treated by those concerned in the monopoly of the traffic between here and Ryde calls loudly for amendment, and which it will be impossible to effect by any appeal to the present parties, who hold themselves responsible to no one and care no more for the interests of the Undercliff than they do for the inhabitants of Hong Kong. Well, the next consideration is, can such state of things be amended? Yes, we say, it can; Railway communication is the only thing that will release us from this state of thraldom. If we are asked the question, but there are two lines before Parliament, which will we adopt? to this we reply, if there are two lines, so much the better, we will support and give our countenance to both plans; we are tired of the monopoly in one direction, let the transit be but divided and the spell is broken, we shall then have our visitors flowing into and out of the place two ways,—our goods the same, perishable and otherwise, that are and have been detained without appeal, and if appeal or complaint were made, it has been replied to (if at all) by evasion and insult. Therefore our duty is clear and demonstrable, namely, to support both schemes, and if preference is given, let it be given to the Newport and Cowes Extension line of Railway.

All Round the Island

...

... There is the gentleman (name unknown) who seems to exists on smoke and anecdotes, and grows a sufficiency of whiskers to keep his pipe constantly filled with them. He is telling the admiring stranger how Sydney Robinson runs a coach from Ryde to Ventnor twice a day, and how he goes down a hill as steep as the roofs of homes at the rate of fourteen miles an hour. "The hills of Wales, sir, are extraordinary; but the Island heats them all, sir." And with this he looks up, as much as to say "What have you got to say to that" ...

A THREE DAYS' TOUR THROUGH THE ISLE OF WIGHT.

...

But let us begin our journey.  Ryde at 11.30 and all on the coach. Away we spin up the steep bill of Ryde, at a ripping pace. The tits answer the whip well. The Isle of Wight retains the old characteristic of coach travelling; for there is no railway in the Island — the Queen won't listen to such a thing —and at Ryde the stranger is struck with the number of these old primrose-colored conveyances rumbling about as gaily as you please. They seem to revive the old times of the "red-nosed race," and have a very singular appearance to one who has not seen a real coach for years. The very walls of the inns are invariably decorated with highly-colored prints of a dashing coachman, driving King William the Fourth's red mail, embellished with a large yellow coat of arms, and a spicy red guard blowing a long yellow horn, behind. Even "an upset" doesn't seem to be a disagreeable picture. We wonder if there is such a thing as a drawing of a locomotive in the Island? We didn't see one; and no doubt there are thousands of natives there at the present moment who have never seen such a thing in reality. The Isle of Wight has three conspicuous features, viz.: steep and nasty hills, old coach travelling, and a race of men who, among the aborigines, are always to be seen with their hands in their pockets. Enquiring of a coachman the reason of the latter feature, he explained that some time ago, before the steamers ran, the primitive people of the Island walked on their hands and legs like bears; and as civilization spread among them they began to acquire a method of walking on their legs only; their hands became thus comparatively useless, and they now put them into their pockets to get them out of the way! The author of this anecdote is our old friend Sydney Robinson, who drives twice a day from Ryde to Ventnor, usually accompanied by George Crow - two old jarveys well known in Sussex and highly respected by and who seem to have taken refuge in the Island as the only place where they can exercise their professional skill.

A THREE DAYS' TOUR THROUGH THE ISLE OF WIGHT.

Ventnor is not only a romantic place, but it is a very singular place. Among the curiosities of this "Madeira of England" is the head waiter of the Royal Hotel. He is, perhaps, the most amusing waiter that one would With to he acquainted with. Complain of the quality of the wine, and lie will give you the history of it from the period of its manufacture up to the time of drawing the cork. He is perfectly unacquainted with the rules of punctuation; for he never makes a full stop, or even a semicolon, or a comma; but a few flashes of the admiration now and then sprout out of his loquacious remarks; and the great charm of it all is, that when he is run down, you cannot at all comprehend what he has been talking about— you merely gather that the wine in question was fermented in his presence about ten years before he was born; that Mr. Bash selected it when he was a baby in arms; that he bottled it as soon as he could waddle; that he has kept it in his cellar ever since he was breeched; and nothing but his strong affection for the gentlemen present would have induced him to bring it from its musty bins. Having succeeded in mystifying the complainant, he bobs off again; but soon reappears prepared to do feats of tumbling, sing a song, stand on his head, beat an imaginary drum on his cheeks, take your photograph with a telescope, dance a hornpipe. or anything else in reason. He is quite an original waiter, and must be a treasure to the place.

Ventnor forms part of the Undercliff of the Isle of Wight, and seems to be rising greatly in public estimation, and there are now running from the place nine four-horse coaches daily. This locality in notoriously the wildest in England; and it was observed some time since by Dr. Clark to be a strange thing, that the people of England should he searching all over the world for a mild climate, whilst the Undercliff quite disregarded. It has been found to be, during the winter months, three or four degrees warmer than Chichester. But it is a singular place; and one might as well live half-way up a chalkpit as in the centre of Ventnor. There is nothing but a series of hills, perpendicular as the roofs of houses. The buildings are all piled one on the top of the other; awl the backyard of your neighbour above looks into your attic window. Fancy a place being built on an irregular staircase, and you get it to a nicety. The hills all twist about in a sig-sag fashion, as they are constricted on the side of an aimed perpendicular cliff, and unless they were made out by these curves they could not be traversed by either man or beast. There is a beautiful esplanade; and the beach is very fine; hut as you look up on the towering cliff above, the houses appear like a lot of rooks' nests in a chalkpit, or something similar to a display of flower-pots in a large greenhouse. The southern foundation of a house is invariably some dozen feet lower than the upper. However healthy it may be in climate its formation would warmly suit asthmatical people who had to walk, or "rearing" horses.
