# Telling

*There's likely a long way to go on this, figuring out a proper story structure, finding the right characters to include and anecodotes to tell. Also finding variants for different time slots: a quick 5 minute tale, an 89, a 12, a 12, a 40, an hour long show. And so on. But for now, here's a quick run throufh of some of what I remember...,*

It's the 1840s, Newport, the Isle of Wight. The telegraph is still a few years away, and the railway, but there are gas lights illuminating the town. Dickens had been resident on the island in '49, and his books were as popular as you might expect. At the end of the summer, "Shirley", a Luddite tale and the new book by Currer Bell, author of the groundbreaking "Jane Eyre" a couple of years previously, was about to go to press. Speculation would surely start up again about who the real author actually was. And perhaps a few, in anticipation, had started re-reading Jane's Eyre tale, of her time in Lowood School, with its miserable food, and cold damp chill, and the typhus, and the tyrannical Mr. Brocklehurst, who controlled the shcool as if it were some of prison camp for clergymen's daughters.

Out on the Cowes road, just past Hunnyhill, Parkhurst Barracks; and the prison: something of an experiment, a facility for boys, something to help them become *useful* members of society, an apprenticeship, or transportation, in exchange for a pardon.

In town, the area around the old St Thomas' Church, between Pyle Street and South Street, or Cosham Street as it was then known, opposite what's now the bus station, that was the area that had a certain *reputation*. For sure, you could find female company on Paradise Row, just down from the Castle Inn, on the other side of the road, but the area around Tontine? Plenty of places for a drink around there. And plenty of places for more.

The streets could be lively too. Rarely was week when the borough court  didn't have someone up on a charge of bring drunk, or disorderly. And the men could be just as bad.

The 1850s. 1854, to be exact. Francis Pittis, auctioneer, fair-minded and just, as you might hope for one of the borough magistrates, is mid-way through his second, year-long term as Mayor. And a great honour it is, too, to be Mayor at the this time, for the funds have finally been raised, and just within the five year time limit proposed, for replacing the increasingly derelict St. Thomas Church with a new Church. His Royal Highness, Prince Albert, has agreed to lay the foundation stone, and the Bishop of Winchester will preside over the ceremony too. Tickets are sold, seats are erectd, and a procession formed, the local Freemasons providing a strong showing and also taking part in the ceremony.

A bottle, containing the coins of the realm and parchment roll, are placed in a cavity beneath the stone. The foundation stone was then partly lowered, and a silver trowel presented to Prince Albert, who uses it to spread cement on the lower stone. The upper stone is let down slowly, with solemn music, and appropriate words are said. His Royal Highness strikes the stone three times with a mallet, and its level is checked with a plumbrule. The Architect presents a maul to the Grand Master, who knocks the stone three times with it. And the brethren respond: *so mote it be*. The tools and the plans now presented to the builder, he in turn scatters corn on the stones then pours wine, and oil, over it. A prayer is offered, and again the brethren respond — 
so mote it be — and the foundation stone is finally considered laid.

His Royal Highness takes his leave, the Freemasons go to their dinner, and the other dignitaries to theirs. Francis Pittis, the Mayor, offers a toast to the His Royal Highness, Prince Albert, and a toast to the Bishop. And then there are the other toasts. Lots of them. And if I were to tell you of them now, we'd have no more time for any more of the tale.

It's 1855, and Currer Bell, author of "Jane Eyre" and "Shirley", dies in Haworth. Folk around those parts had guessed, of course, had *worked it out*, that Currer Bell was Charlotte Bronte. If the hints in their — her — first book, describing life at Cowan Bridge School for Clergymen's Daughters in the guise of life at Lowood hadn't been enough, then the clues in "Shirley" were to obvious to deny. And I do have tales of those times, of the Luddites who roamed the hills and valleys around Huddersfield, where a young Irish curate, a certain Patrick Bronte, had lived and worked, but those are tales for another day. Because now it's 1855, and a certain evangelical priest, the Revd. W. (for William) Carus Wilson was visiting his old family haunts around Kirby Lonsdale, where he'd founded a school three decades or so before.

And from there, to Ventnor, at the start of summer, in 1855, as announced by the fashionable list for Ventnor in the local paper of the day, the original Isle of Wight Observer.

Now, I don't know if the building works surrounding the new Church had anything to do with it, or whether it was the arrival a newly retired and particularly evangelical vicar to the Island — because yes, even then, over a hundred and fifty years ago, people retired here — but at the end of September 1855, a letter was presented to the Magistrates of Newport. A letter complaining about groups frequently "conducting themselves in a manner most offensive to virtue" and calling for better regulation and policing of lodging houses and beershops.

And if that might not seem as if it were much — toasting the Prince, and the Bishop of Winchester at the foundation of the new Church — it is one of the things that was remembered about Mr. Pittis, or *Sir* Pittis, as he later became, long time magistrate of the boriugh of Newport and several times Mayor, in his obituary almost forty five years later, in 1889. That and other time he met with Royalty, when he was knighted as the Mayor of Newport in the year that celbrated, and organised, the Queen's Jubilee celebrations in Newport in 1887.

On the one hand, the message was clear: Newport was a place "lost to Christianity, and devoted to crime", a home to a *torrent of juvenile profligacy and prostitution*.

There is no doubt that the streets could be described as *vibrant*. The Crimean War was in full flow, and Parkurst Barracks was used to station the troops just before they set off on th ships leaving Portsmpouth, heading off to who knew what future. Up to thirteen hundred young men at a time, barracked there; thirteen hundred new recruits, with coin in their pocket and a perhaps only a short life to live while they still had a chance.

The Magistrates were doing what they could, but in many cases, they had no case to prosecute if no-one complained.

And so it was that on New Year's day, 1856, an evangelical priest recently retired to the Island — to Ventnor — who had founded a school for Clergymen's Daughters, somewhere up North, thirty years previously, and with a track record in publishing penny publications filled with frankly harrowing Christian tales, on New Year's day, he had delivered to many of the perhaps more deserving households in Newport, a tract.

*"Tempters and Tempted"* it was called. And I still haven't managed to find a copy of it. But it certainly seemed to have had an effect, becuase the very next Council meeting, the new Mayor, a Mr. Hearn, stood up to denounce it and express his anger at it.

One of the other councillors traced it's origins back to *that letter* the magistrates had received a few months before and before the meeting was out, it was decided — not quite pithforks — but that a letter be sent by the mayor to the author of the tract, to the Revd. W. Carus Wilson, of Ventor.

Yes. A letter. A letter. And probably a very strongly worded letter at that. Or at least, a quite strongly worded letter. Probably. But still polite. I'm guessing. Because I haven't managed to find a copy or a transcript of that, either.

And did that letter have the desired effect, whatever that might have been? A retraction of the charges made against the people anand character of Newport, perhaps?

Erm... nope.

But it did provake *a* response, And quite quickly too. A response in the form of *another* tract, also published out of Ventnor, with the rather snappy, and social media and search engine optimised, title of *A LETTER TO THE MAYOR OF NEWPORT, in Reply to his Letter of Remonstrances regarding the Tract, entitled “Tempters and Tempted", by the Rev. W. CARUS WILSON.*.

Now, you know how things go in threes in stories? Well, that's the third thing I haven't been able to find a copy of — yet — but there are some clues as to what was in it. Something libelous, for example. Because the tract hadn't really been available for any time at all before a street seller, the rather excellently named Nobby Ducks — which may or may not have been a nickname — was hauled up before the Magistrates for selling a liebelous work. But although the police appeared to have been tipped off that it was libelous, there was no one there to actually prosecute the case, and so Nobby Ducks was released. At which point, his defense council asked for the pamphlets back or he would prosecute the Magistrates for illegally taking them. The Magistrates told him he would have to sort it out with the Police.

Despite no-one being in court that day to press the charges of libel, a case was called a few days later. By Mr. Pittis. Against the Reverend W. Carus Wilson. For it seems that the rather snappily titled, the social media and search engine optimised *LETTER TO THE MAYOR OF NEWPORT, in Reply to his Letter of Remonstrances regarding the Tract, entitled “Tempters and Tempted", by the Rev. W. CARUS WILSON* went even further than *Tempters and Tempted* had by calling out several people of the better classes, if not by name, but by implication.

And as evidence of this, Mr. Pittis' defence council, who also happened to be the Town Clerk, read out in Court the sentence on page 13 that he believed identified Mr. Pittis, as *"the magistrate who presides at a dinner toasting a Bishop after the consecration of a church, and spouting about the church of our forefathers"*.

Alough he didn't read the next bit. The bit where such a man is described as being ”known to be a frequenter of the brothel.". He didn't say that. But the report in one of the Hampshire newspapers did. Just so that if you *hadn't* seen the pamphlet, or didn't know what the actual libel was supposed to be, well, now you did.

At this point, Carus Wilson's defence council got up to defend his clients case, the reverend gentleman himself being absent and having sent a sick note in his place. It was all purely a misunderstanding, and when he wrote the pamphlet he had no thought that could ever be interpreted as referring to Mr. Pittis, whom he had only heard honourable things about, but instead had been referring to a *type* of person. And as evidence of that, the defense council then read out a letter that Carus WIlson had sent to Mr. Pittis explaining that that sentence had been pulled from a letter that Carus Wilson had received from someone in Bristol, sympathising in general terms as a comment about the fight against immorality *in general*. And thar Carus Wilson had certainly not meant to imply anything about anyone in particular in Newport. And he was sorry.

At this point, the Mayor interjected and said that was all very well but Carus Wilson had also continued to the malign the town and and its inhabitants in the tract. The audience in the court duly applauded and cheered their Mayor, but Carus Wilson's lawyer said that was *not* what the current case was about and that the Mayor's interruption was completely out of order.

The Bench conferred and said that as they were pretty sure that Mr. Pittis would be accepting the apology, the Mayor's challenges were not directly relevent to anything the Court had heard and he would not be allowed to make any further comments, not least becuase he was also the Chief Magistrate and should know better.

At which point we might imagine that Mr Eldridge, Pittis' council, and Mr. Pittis had a brief exchange, as the apology was accepted on behalf of Mr. Pittis, who, being a fair and just man, had not wanted to push things any further than an honourable resolution, being the good Christian that he, which is to say, Mr. Pittis, certainly was.

Carus Wilson's direct engagement with Island matters seems to tail off at this point, aside from reports of the occasional sermon, fundraising for the new CHurch and the local schools, but that's not to say he wasn't busy.

Indeed, he seems to have been spending a lot of time on the mainland, in Portsmouth and Gosport, through eighteen fifty six and seven, supporting the soldiers there. although I'm nopt sure how he got there? Was a "through boat" from Ventor?!

Carus Wilson's interests in the moral life of soldiers seems to have started whilst dtravelling in Southern European. Previous encounters with Sardinian soldiers in Nice and French soldiers in Boulogne had resulted in a mission to provide them with Bibles and prayer books. On the Island, his initial concerns appear to have been for the morals of the tempted soldiers at Parkhust. But in Portsmouth, he saw a greater opportunity: an opportunity to *start* something.

Just as he had been motivated three decades before to found a school to support the less well off clergymen by providing an education for their daughters for an affordable fee, in Portsmouth he championed the idea of Soldiers' Institute, a club for soldiers, similir in astyle to Mechanics Insitutes, and importantly, *away from the barracks* where the soldiers could go an relax, play games, drink coffee, consult books an newspapers in the reading room or library. And maybe even attend a few classes or two. Not *just* bible classes, but perhaps those as well.

And so it was — a building was found, money raised by subscription, and the Soldiers' Institute was born.

But still, Carus Wilson couldn't resist making a making a point though his pen.

An so it was, a year after publishing "Tempters and Tempted" and upsetting the boroughmen of Newport, Carus Wilson wrote another New Year's tract — °Portsmouth in Flames° — and I *have* managed to track a copy of this one down.

The flames it describes are the flames of TO DO

claimed some success

But the response appears to have been mockery.

Through 1857, Carus Wilson continued to visit Gosport, giving out bibles and prayer books; NAME,  his name occasionally appearing in the Hampshire press TO DO

But in the North of England, his name was filling the local and regional press with controversey.

When Currer Bell had died, and identified to one and all as Charlotte Bronte, of Haworth, TO DO





And there we have it. In ?? 1859, publisher died, then Ann, at their home in Ventnor then as so often happens etc the Revd. W. Carus Wilson, six weeks later in London.

daughter carried on the letters, the school continued, and the Soldiers' Institute struggled on.

In Newport, the ladies of the pave continued to ply their trade, the PUBS et etc.

Final story.

And that is where my tale ends.
