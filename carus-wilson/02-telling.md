*There's likely a long way to go on this, figuring out a proper story structure, finding the right characters to include and anecdotes to tell. Also finding variants for different time slots: a quick 5 minute tale, an 8, a 12, a 20, a 40, an hour long show. And so on. The general arc of the telling has scope for allowing different shorter set pieces, character sketches, etc., to be included as required. For now, here's a quick run through of some of what I remember...*

I'd like to tell you a story. A story I stumbled across and pieced together over a period of about six weeks earlier this year. A story that started when I stumbled across a report of a letter, a *memorial*, presented to the magistrates of Newport whilst looking through the  online British Newspaper Archive. A story of the *nursery of vice* that Newport was at the time. And a story that ended with some literary detective work, and a very public controversy that played out in the northern press.

So let's set the scene.

It's the 1840s. We're on the Isle of Wight. In Newport. The electric telegraph is still a few years away from reaching town, and the railway hasn't arrived yet either. But there are gas lights illuminating some of the streets and several newspapers, from the Isle of Wight Observer, and the Isle of Wight Mercury, to several Hampshire titles, all reporting the island's news.

In 1849, Charles Dickens had stopped over on the island for a short stay in Bonchurch; his books were as popular then as they are today, perhaps even more so. At the end of that summer of 1849, "Shirley", a Luddite tale and the new book by Currer Bell, author of the groundbreaking "Jane Eyre" a couple of years previously, was about to go to press. Speculation would surely start up again about who the real author actually was. Perhaps a few, in anticipation, had started re-reading Jane's Eyre tale, of her time in Lowood School, with its miserable food, and cold damp chill, and the typhus, and the evangelical Mr. Brocklehurst, who controlled the school as if it were some of prison camp for turning clergymen's daughters into faceless governesses.

So much for the books of the time. What was Newport actually like, in the 1850s?

Out on the Cowes road, just past Hunnyhill, was Albany Barracks; a little further up the road, the prison: something of an experiment, a facility for boys, something to help them become *useful* members of society, a route to an apprenticeship and a pardon, rather than transportation.

In Newport town itself, the layout was much as it is today, the streetnames largely the same. Three markets TO DO

 TO DO
 
the area around the old St Thomas' Church, between Pyle Street and South Street, or Cosham Street as it was then known, opposite what's now the bus station, that was the area that had a certain *reputation*. For sure, you could find company on the appropriately named Paradise Row, just down from the Castle Inn, on the other side of the road there.

You can perhaps get a sense of what life was like on Paradise Row from some of the reports of the time.

Take a certain Miss Eliza Brading, for example, "a dashing young Cyprian" as the Hampshire Adversiser described her. She had lately been exhibiting around Newport "under distinguished patronage", whatver that means, though you can be pretty sure it wasn't anything to do with her etchings. She lived thereabouts, in Paradise Row, in the mid-1840s, and if you'd lived there too, you might well have been familiar with her...

One time, a Sunday, quarter to two in the morning or thereabouts, a couple of the local policeman heard such a row in Paradise Row they felt the need to investigate. All manner of effing and blinding appeared to be going in one of the houses between male and female voices. Suddently, the door to the house in question flew open, and young woman rushed out, and slammed it shut. Moments later, the door was in pieces as her father literally smashed it open. Seeing the policemen, he picked up one of the pieces of broken wood, and started beating them with it.

Eliza Brading, for that's who the young lady was, stopped her drunken shouting at her father, and instead started hurling abuse at the policemen, and then joined her father's attack on them, biting them and clawing at them with her fingernails.

Eventually, the father and daughter were got under control, and told them to "just settle down, or we'll lock you up." But this seems to have been too much for Eliza — who was apparently "very tipsy" at the time — and she ended up being taken to the station-house. When her character was described to the court as that of a common prostitute, [raises here hands] "how dare you call me that" was her response, as she vigorously defended her chastity.

"Wasn't it your own father calling you a soldier's whore?" said the Inspector, "and you replying who it was that paid the rent and kept the family?"

"I was never with any soldiers", came the reply.

"Officers, then... aren't they soldiers? And when we are at the station-house, didn't you say you'd tell the court I'd look for any opportunity to come in with you?"

"Ah! you'd say anything, you would. And anyway, it was you who knocked my father down, three times at least, and I was only trying to defend him, and it was they who were hitting me, right across my back. And it was you who wouldn't even give me a glass of water to cool my parched lips at the station-house."

The court was not impressed, and sentenced her to a month in the local bridewell to stop her career for a short while at least. This sentence seems to have rather taken young Eliza back, becuase she had a full purse available with which to pay off her antcipated fine and hadn't expected to receive a custodial sentence.

It was then time for Eliza's father, James Brading, a mason, to face the bench. He couldn't deny the events, but he did try an alternative strategy.

"So did you find the money I lost from my pocket when you knocked me in the gutter that night? You said you'd see about it when you came back."

The Inspector just shook his head. "That's the first I've heard of any money. All you had on was your trousers, though you did say you'd tell the Magistrates where I sold the bad money," which raised a laugh in the court.

"How can you say that? Shocked, I am, that you a policemen should tell such a lie..."

But again the Court was not impressed, and James Brading was fined 15s (which I suspect, was 10 shillings fine, plus costs).

"Aren't these worth your 10 shillings and more?" he said, trying to show off the bruises he'd received at the hands of the police, presumably, rather than his daughter.

But the Court seemed not to think that, although they did offer him 10 days in jail in lieu of the fine. In the event, however, it seems his dutiful daughter and her ready purse strings covered his fine and kept him out of jail, even if she had not been so fortunate.

So that was a sense of life in Paradise Row.

But it wasn't just Paradise Row that had a reputation. The area around Tontine Yard, there were plenty of places there for a drink, The Tontine Tap most notable amongst them. The And plenty of places for more. And there are plenty of stories about just went on there, but they are perhaps stories more suited to another time.

The streets could be lively too. Rarely was there a week when the borough court didn't have someone up on a charge of being drunk, or disorderly, shouting and singing, or fighting and swearing in the streets at all hours. And the men could be just as bad.

If you search through the old archives, you find some of the names coming round again and again, some of them quite quickly, some of them years apart. And some fine old characters too.

Take Repentance Adams, for example, "repentance" being a cognomen, a commonly used nickname, her real name being "Patience". You can't help but get the feeling that she was someone who was known around town, someone you'd recognise if you saw her, someone you'd know a story about. I first came across her in 1834, when she was charged with having stolen a bed, then next year, this time described as an "old offender" along with another woman, Jane Wheeler, she was said to be aged forty two and had been hauled up before the court for stealing turnips. A couple of years later again, she was at the centre of something of a *cause célèbre*. It seemed that someone in Newport had been stealing doormats. From all over town, doormats had been going missing. People started to set watch; the police started to patrol more. When the culprit was at last discovered, scurrying through the Newport streets with the corner of a mat visible from underneath her apron, it was none other than old Repentance Adams. A few years further on, in the mid-1840s, she was in the papers again, the notorious doormat thief of the eighteen thirties, this time for stealing baskets. Four months hard labour she got for that. When 1850 came around, she was back before the bench on a charge of vagrancy. The last mention I saw of her, it was 1858, when the court reports mention her as "an old woman of eighty", charged with stealing a hand kerchief bundle from an inmate of the House of Industry.

She been making her way towards the bridge at the bottom Hunny Hill when she seen one of the men who lived at the workhouse coming the other way. He stopped at the cottage by the bridge there, place the bundle he'd been carrying over his shoulder by under the hedge, opened the gate and wandered up the path, nodding to young Winddebank the gardener as his did so. Now what's left under a hedge can be found under a hedge, even if it does contain a man's tobacco, sugar, a small piece of bacon and a couple of penny lardy cakes he was looking forward to for his tea, so as old Repentance Adams passed she scooped it up and hid under her skirts before hurrying away.

Now the man who gone up to the cottage had done so to ask for a light for his pipe, and a quick bit of chat, and clean forget his bundle as he left, hurrying past an old woman shuffling along the road before remembering it and turning back to...not find it. Not find it anywhere. But he was sure he left here somewhere... "You didn't see me leave a bindle here did you?" he said young man Windebank. "Leave a bundle? No...", came the reply, "but I did see that old woman from town pick one up.. You know the one..." and he described her...

The man turned round and immediately headed off in search of the old woman, he it seems must have hidden the bundle under her shawl, and as she'd made her way attempted to get dispose of the recently found goods. By the time he found, the evidence was gone, apart perhaps for some crumbs of lardy cake upon he apron. On challenging her, with claims that the gardener Windybank had seen he take the bundle, the old woman denied all knowledge of it, and she'd never heard of such a thing; so the man took her back to the cottage at the bridge by the river at the bottom of Hunny Hill, where young man Windybank confirmed what he'd seen. When the case was heard a few days later, the testimony was compelling, and despite her protestations of innocence, old woman Adams — Repentance Adams — was found guilty of the court, and preferring to receive its penalty than being sent to the Winchester Assizes, received a month's stay in Winchester jail as her sentence.

So that was Repentance Adams. A regular old offender indeed.

Back in Newport, back in 1854, Francis Pittis, auctioneer, fair-minded and just, as you might hope for one of the borough magistrates, is mid-way through his second, year-long term as Mayor. And a great honour it is, too, to be Mayor at the this time, for the funds have finally been raised, and just within the five year time limit proposed, for replacing the increasingly derelict St. Thomas Church with a new Church. His Royal Highness, Prince Albert, has agreed to lay the foundation stone, and the Bishop of Winchester will preside over the ceremony too. Tickets are sold, seats are erectd, and a procession formed, the local Freemasons providing a strong showing and also taking part in the ceremony.

A bottle, containing the coins of the realm and parchment roll, are placed in a cavity beneath the stone. The foundation stone was then partly lowered, and a silver trowel presented to Prince Albert, who uses it to spread cement on the lower stone. The upper stone is let down slowly, with solemn music, and appropriate words are said. His Royal Highness strikes the stone three times with a mallet, and its level is checked with a plumbrule. The Architect presents a maul to the Grand Master, who knocks the stone three times with it. And the brethren respond: *so mote it be*. The tools and the plans now presented to the builder, he in turn scatters corn on the stones then pours wine, and oil, over it. A prayer is offered, and again the brethren respond — __so mote it be__ — and the foundation stone is finally considered laid.

His Royal Highness takes his leave, the Freemasons go to their dinner, and the other dignitaries to theirs. Francis Pittis, the Mayor, offers a toast to the His Royal Highness, Prince Albert, and a toast to the Bishop. And then there are the other toasts. Lots of them. And if I were to tell you of them now, we'd have no more time for any more of the tale.

Around about that time, late summer and early Autumn of 1854, there used to be a pub on the Trafalgar Road, going out towards Carisbrooke, what was then known as Deadman's Lane. There was a pub somewhere thereabouts called the Crab and Lobster which appears to have had something of a reputation from the number of court reports it features in.

TO DO


Another year passes, and the newspapers carry the news that Currer Bell, author of "Jane Eyre" and "Shirley", has died in the North of England, somewhere, somewhere or other called Haworth. Folk around those parts had guessed, of course, had *worked it out*, that Currer Bell was Charlotte Bronte. If the hints in their — her — first book, describing life at Cowan Bridge School for Clergymen's Daughters in the guise of life at Lowood hadn't been enough, then the clues in "Shirley" were to obvious to deny. And I do have tales of those times, of the Luddites who roamed the hills and valleys around Huddersfield, where a young Irish curate, a certain Patrick Bronte, had lived and worked, but those are tales for another day. Because now it's 1855, and a certain evangelical priest, the Revd. W. (for William) Carus Wilson was visiting his old family haunts around Kirby Lonsdale, where he'd founded a school three decades or so before.

And from there, he retired to Ventnor, his arrival noted in the fashionable list for Ventnor in the local paper of the day, the original Isle of Wight Observer.

Now, I don't know if the building works surrounding the new Church had anything to do with it, or whether it was the arrival a newly retired and particularly evangelical vicar to the Island — because yes, even then, over a hundred and fifty years ago, people retired here — but at the end of September 1855, a letter was presented to the Magistrates of Newport. A letter complaining about groups frequently "conducting themselves in a manner most offensive to virtue" and calling for better regulation and policing of lodging houses and beershops.

And if that might not seem as if it were much — toasting the Prince, and the Bishop of Winchester at the foundation of the new Church — it is one of the things that was remembered about Mr. Pittis, or *Sir* Pittis, as he later became, long time magistrate of the boriugh of Newport and several times Mayor, in his obituary almost forty five years later, in 1889. That and other time he met with Royalty, when he was knighted as the Mayor of Newport in the year that celbrated, and organised, the Queen's Jubilee celebrations in Newport in 1887.

On the one hand, the message was clear: Newport was a place "lost to Christianity, and devoted to crime", a home to a *torrent of juvenile profligacy and prostitution*.

There is no doubt that the streets could be described as *vibrant*. The Crimean War was in full flow, and Parkurst Barracks was used to station the troops just before they set off on the ships leaving Portsmouth, heading off to who knew what future. Up to thirteen hundred young men at a time, barracked there; thirteen hundred new recruits, with coin in their pocket and a perhaps only a short life to live while they still had a chance.

The Magistrates were doing what they could, but in many cases, they had no case to prosecute if no-one complained.

And so it was that on New Year's day, 1856, an evangelical priest recently retired to the Island — to Ventnor — who had founded a school for Clergymen's Daughters, somewhere up North, thirty years previously, and with a track record in publishing penny publications filled with frankly harrowing Christian tales, on New Year's day, he had delivered to many of the perhaps more deserving households in Newport, a tract.

*"Tempters and Tempted"* it was called. And I still haven't managed to find a copy of it. But it certainly seemed to have had an effect, because the very next Council meeting, the new Mayor, a Mr. Hearn, stood up to denounce it and express his anger at it.

One of the other councillors traced it's origins back to *that letter* the magistrates had received a few months before and before the meeting was out, it was decided — not quite pithforks — but that a letter be sent by the mayor to the author of the tract, to the Revd. W. Carus Wilson, of Ventnor.

Yes. A letter. A letter. And probably a very strongly worded letter at that. Or at least, a quite strongly worded letter. Probably. But still polite. I'm guessing. Because I haven't managed to find a copy or a transcript of that, either.

And did that letter have the desired effect, whatever that might have been? A retraction of the charges made against the people anand character of Newport, perhaps?

Erm... nope.

But it did provoke *a* response, And quite quickly too. A response in the form of *another* tract, also published out of Ventnor, with the rather snappy, and social media and search engine optimised, title of *A LETTER TO THE MAYOR OF NEWPORT, in Reply to his Letter of Remonstrances regarding the Tract, entitled "Tempters and Tempted", by the Rev. W. CARUS WILSON.*.

Now, you know how things go in threes in stories? Well, that's the third thing I haven't been able to find a copy of — yet — but there are some clues as to what was in it. Something libelous, for example. Because the tract hadn't really been available for any time at all before a street seller, the rather excellently named Nobby Ducks — which may or may not have been a nickname — was hauled up before the Magistrates for selling a libelous work. But although the police appeared to have been tipped off that it was libelous, there was no one there to actually prosecute the case, and so Nobby Ducks was released. At which point, his defense council asked for the pamphlets back or he would prosecute the Magistrates for illegally taking them. The Magistrates told him he would have to sort it out with the Police.

Despite no-one being in court that day to press the charges of libel, a case was called a few days later. By Mr. Pittis. Against the Reverend W. Carus Wilson. For it seems that the rather snappily titled, the social media and search engine optimised *LETTER TO THE MAYOR OF NEWPORT, in Reply to his Letter of Remonstrances regarding the Tract, entitled "Tempters and Tempted", by the Rev. W. CARUS WILSON* went even further than *Tempters and Tempted* had by calling out several people of the better classes, if not by name, but by implication.

And as evidence of this, Mr. Pittis' defence council, who also happened to be the Town Clerk, read out in Court the sentence on page 13 that he believed identified Mr. Pittis, as *"the magistrate who presides at a dinner toasting a Bishop after the consecration of a church, and spouting about the church of our forefathers"*.

Although he didn't read the next bit. The bit where such a man is described as being "known to be a frequenter of the brothel.". He didn't say that. But the report in one of the Hampshire newspapers did. Just so that if you *hadn't* seen the pamphlet, or didn't know what the actual libel was supposed to be, well, now you did.

At this point, Carus Wilson's defence council got up to defend his clients case, the reverend gentleman himself being absent and having sent a sick note in his place. It was all purely a misunderstanding, and when he wrote the pamphlet he had no thought that could ever be interpreted as referring to Mr. Pittis, whom he had only heard honourable things about, but instead had been referring to a *type* of person. And as evidence of that, the defense council then read out a letter that Carus Wilson had sent to Mr. Pittis explaining that that sentence had been pulled from a letter that Carus Wilson had received from someone in Bristol, sympathising in general terms as a comment about the fight against immorality *in general*. And that Carus Wilson had certainly not meant to imply anything about anyone in particular in Newport. And he was sorry.

At this point, the Mayor interjected and said that was all very well but Carus Wilson had also continued to the malign the town and its inhabitants in the tract. The audience in the court duly applauded and cheered their Mayor, but Carus Wilson's lawyer said that was *not* what the current case was about and that the Mayor's interruption was completely out of order.

The Bench conferred and said that as they were pretty sure that Mr. Pittis would be accepting the apology, the Mayor's challenges were not directly relevant to anything the Court had heard and he would not be allowed to make any further comments, not least because he was also the Chief Magistrate and should know better.

At which point we might imagine that Mr Eldridge, Pittis' council, and Mr. Pittis had a brief exchange, as the apology was accepted on behalf of Mr. Pittis, who, being a fair and just man, had not wanted to push things any further than an honourable resolution, being the good Christian that he, which is to say, Mr. Pittis, certainly was.

Carus Wilson's direct engagement with Island matters seems to tail off at this point, aside from reports of the occasional sermon, fundraising for the new Church and the local schools, but that's not to say he wasn't busy.

Indeed, he seems to have been spending a lot of time on the mainland, in Portsmouth and Gosport, through eighteen fifty six and seven, supporting the soldiers there. although I'm not sure how he got there? Was there a "through boat" from Ventnor?!

Carus Wilson's interests in the moral life of soldiers seems to have started whilst travelling in Southern European. Previous encounters with Sardinian soldiers in Nice and French soldiers in Boulogne had resulted in a mission to provide them with Bibles and prayer books. On the Island, his initial concerns appear to have been for the morals of the tempted soldiers at Parkhurst. But in Portsmouth, he saw a greater opportunity: an opportunity to *start* something.

Just as he had been motivated three decades before to found a school to support the less well off clergymen by providing an education for their daughters for an affordable fee, in Portsmouth he championed the idea of Soldiers' Institute, a club for soldiers, similar in style to Mechanics Institutes, and importantly, *away from the barracks* where the soldiers could go and relax, play games, drink coffee, consult books and newspapers in the reading room or library. And maybe even attend a few classes or two. Not *just* bible classes, but perhaps those as well.

And so it was — a building was found, money was raised by subscription, and the Soldiers' Institute was born. TO DO

But still, Carus Wilson couldn't resist making a making a point though his pen.

And so it was, a year after publishing "Tempters and Tempted" and upsetting the boroughmen of Newport, Carus Wilson wrote *another* New Year's tract — "Portsmouth in Flames" — and I *have* managed to track a copy of this one down, albeit as part of a collection of tracts published by the Ipswich Temperance Society. Which perhaps gives you a clue as to its theme.

The pamphlet appears to be a response to Carus Wilson's encounters with the "haunts of immorality" and "the bars of the gin palaces" in and around Portsmouth, estabishments which "fanned the flames of sin" and "layed waste the dearest interests of immortal beings".

In particular, he layed the charge of sin not at the patrons of the bars and gin palaces and other "strongholds of Satan", but at the brewers and distillers, who would stoke the flames of sin in Portsmouth, fling souls on to the fires of hell, wholesale, as if they were faggots. He took heart that some of them were already "beginning to tremble at the prospect of their future reckoning", although he wondered at "the consciences of these men" and how "they expect to compose themselves on a dying pillow, or to stand in the judgment day" when the "flame of divine judgement" will surely make its ruling against them.

Anecdotally, it seems that Carus Wilson's mission persuaded "one of the largest brewers in Portsmouth to announce his conviction of the iniquities fostered by the sale of beer, and his determination to abandon his lucrative business for ever" and there were suggestions that "there was a visible decrease in the amount of drunkenness, vice, and disorder in the town", but generally, it seems as if the tract attracted mockery rather than moral improvement.

Commentators wondered whether Carus Wilson would follow up "Portsmouth in Flames" with other tracts — "Brighton in Blazes,"  maybe, or "Southampton, Storehouse of Sin,", or perhaps return his focus to the island with "Ryde the Ruined," — but increasing ill-health appears to have but an end to his New Year's Day publications.

Through 1857, Carus Wilson continued to visit Gosport, giving out bibles and prayer books; NAME,  his name occasionally appearing in the Hampshire press 

TO DO

But in the North of England, his name was filling the local and regional press with controversy.

When Currer Bell had died, and her identity was revealed to one and all as Charlotte Bronte, of Haworth, the Lowood School described so bleakly in Jane Eyre was rapidly identified with the Clergymans' Daughters School at Cowan Bridge, and who else could have been the inspiration for Mr Brocklehurst, the ??? TO DO other than Carus Wilson?

The story wasn't really a story, though. And it may have remained one of those peculiar literary noticings mentioned in a publication such as the rather fantastic *Notes & Queries*, which I'm hoping to weave into another set of historically connected tales, at some point. But then, after the prompting of Patrick Bronte, Charlotte's father, a couple of years earlier, came "The Life", in 1857 — or to give it it's full title, "The Life of Charlotte Bronte" — by Elizabeth Gaskell, or "Mrs Gaskell" as she was more widely known, friend and confidante to Charlotte Bronte, and as a Unitarian was might perhaps be expected to be rather antagonistic to the evangelical Carus Wilson and what may have been his rather fundamentalist position on Original Sin.

W. W. Carus Wilson had also been in correspondence with Mrs. Gaskell, who agreed to make some amendements to the thid edition of her biolgraphy of Chartlotte Bronte.

The description of Lowood, in "Jane Eyre" is evidently the result of a morbid impression on the mind of a highly sensitive child of nine, but it is due the estimable persons who were connected with it to state that the frightful charges brought against it by C. Bronte are denied; and the charitable designs of its founder have not been perverted in the way she has led her readers to believe.

a case of drugging


Caroline Peirce (Pearce) as a character running through 1854-6

July 1854 

Caroline Pearce and Ellen Pearce, two sisters and common prostitutes, were charged by P.C. Hobbs with being in the street Wednesday night last, about 12 o'clock, for the purpose of prostitution.

The policeman not being able to swear that Ellen was present at the time she was dismissed, but Caroline was fined 10s. and 5s. costs, which was paid.

Caroline Pierce and Ellen Pierce, two girls of the town, were charged with loitering in the High-street, on Wednesday night, at half-past twelve, for an improper purpose. Police-constable Hobbs said that he saw several girls there on the occasion, among whom were Caroline Pierce and, he believed, Ellen Pierce, but was not certain. He went towards the girls, when they passed through the Corn Market and stood under the Mechanics' Institution. He made towards them again, and they then moved towards the Green Dragon-yard. Caroline Pierce and another came back; the other girls went in different directions. He ordered them to go home, but instead of doing so, they went into the High-street. They were constantly in the High-street, and he had seen them speak to gentlemen, and go away with them. They were generally quiet, but the street swarms with girls of that description.— Police-constable Grapes said the girls were continually in the street at an improper hour.— Ellen said she was not in the High-street at all, and Caroline said she had been to a party at the Beehive, and only went into Cosham-street with her companions, who lived there, and she was going home when she met police-constable Hobbs. It should never occur again, and she was very sorry it had now happened.— Mr. Cooke said he had no doubt but that Ellen was as profligate as her sister, and warned them and other girls in Court about strolling the streets at night.— Caroline was fined 10s, and 5s costs, which she paid immediately.
