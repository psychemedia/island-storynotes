# The Cowen Bridge School Controversy

In what was to be W. Carus Wilson's final year, one of his original projects would see his name and character being challenged in the national press. The trigger was the publication of a biography of a renowned literary figure, a certain Currer Bell, also known as Charlotte Brontë. Currer Bell's first work, *Jane Eyre*, had featured a certain school for the children of clerics, and its overly religious founder, in less than complementary terms. And Charlotte Brontë's biographer, Mrs. Gaskell, had been even more damning in her characterisation of the real world inspiration for both the school and its founder.

JANE EYRE : AN AUTOBIOGRAPHY. Edited by CURRER BELL. 3 vols. Published: October, 1847


Charlotte Bronte died March 31st, 1855.

THE AUTHOR OF JANE EYRE ( From Sharpe's Magazine )

On the northern side of one of the wildest and bleakest moors of Yorkshire, stands the little village of Haworth, consisting of church and few gray stone cottages. One of these, scarcely superior to its fellows, and distinguished only by a sort of courtyard surrounded a low stone wall, and overgrown with grass (shrubs and refusing vegetate ungenial atmosphere), the parsonage. The architecture is of the simplest description—a straight walk leads up to the front door, either aide of which appears a window, that of the sitting room looking into the churchyard, well filled with gravestones. On this parsonage, until within a few mouths since, not a touch of paint, nor article of new furniture, had been expended for thirty years, the period which has elapsed since the death of Miss Bronte's mother. Some six or seven years antecedent to that date, Irish clergyman, the Rev. Patrick Bronte, then resident at Penzance, espoused a young lady, contrary to the wishes of her relations, who refused to hold any intercourse with her after her marriage. Her husband, obtaining the perpetual curacy of Haworth, took his bride to his new residence, where she spent the remainder her days, dying in a rapid consumption after the birth of her sixth child, Charlotte. Mr Bronte, who, though advanced in years, is still alive, is described as a man of studious and solitary habits, and of singular and highly eccentric turn of mind, which, together with a very peculiar temper, must have rendered him anything but a suitable guardian to a youthful family. Nor can we wonder at the mother's dying exclamation, "What will become of my poor children !" Engrossed by his own pursuits, the father never even dined with his family nor taught them anything, and the children learned to write and read from servants only. When Charlotte was twelve years old, she (even then of an original and self-reliant nature) asked and obtained her father's permission, that her sisters and herself should be placed at the clergy school Cowan Bridge. This, as it then existed, she has described to the life in "Jane Eyre." Two of her sisters died of the fever which one time devastated the school ; the two others, and probably Charlotte herself, quitted it with the seeds of consumption in their constitutions, fostered by the cruel privations they underwent. The food was horrible, and of it, bad as it was, they obtained so little that often they were literally half starved. Frequently has she "crept under the table to pick up the crumbs others had dropped." At the time of the fever the doctor examined the food ; he put some in his mouth, and hastily rejecting it, protesting it was not fit for dogs. "So hungry was I," said Charlotte, "that I could have eaten what he threw away." The three survivors returned to Haworth with broken health ; but there fresh trials awaited him. "At nineteen," continued Charlotte, "I should have been thankful fur a penny a week. I asked my father ; but he said ' What women want with money ?' She was yet only nineteen when she advertised for and obtained situation as teacher in a school; not finding it turn out she had hoped, she waited until she had saved money enough to pay her passage to Brussels, where she had secured a position as school teacher—she started alone, never having previously quitted Yorkshire. When she arrived in London it was night; she became alarmed, and, not knowing where to go, and fearing to trust herself with strangers, she took a cab, drove to the Tower Stairs, hired a boat, and was conveyed to the Ostend packet. At first, the otficer in command refused to take her on board till the next morning, but on learning her desolate situation, recalled his prohibition. In Brussels she remained two years ; her experiences there are detailed in "Villette." The character of "Adele," in particular, is drawn from life. On her return, she found that the health of her two remaining sisters was declining, and that her father's eyesight was becoming affected, and she considered it her duty to remain at home. She tried various ways of increasing their income, but failed in all. Without mentioning her project to her father, she wrote "Jane Eyre," a work of which Messrs. Smith and Elder had the good sense to perceive the merits, and were courageous enough to publish it, in spite of its peculiarities, which might have alarmed any but a really spirited publisher. About three months after the appearance of her novel, and when its success was no longer doubtful, Miss Bronte resolved to screw up her courage, and inform her father of the step she had taken. Mr Bronte, it appears, did not then join his family, even at meal-times. At dinner, Charlotte announced her intention to her sisters, adding, that she would put it into execution before tea! Accordingly, she marched into his study with a copy her work, wrapped up in review it, which she had received, and the following conversation ensued :—

"Papa, I have been writing a book!"

" Have you, dear!" (He went on reading)

"But, papa, I want you to look at it."

" I can't be troubled to read a manuscript."

" But it is printed."

" I hope you're not been involving yourself in any such silly expense."

"I think 1 shall gain some money by it; may I read you some reviews of it!" She read the reviews, and again asked him if he would look over the book ; he said she might leave it, and he would see. Later on that same evening he sent his daughters an invitation to drink tea with him. When the meal was nearly concluded, he said : "Children, Charlotte has been writing a book, and I think it is a better one than I expected." For some years he never mentioned the subject again.

A lady, who afterwards became intimate with Miss Bronte, thus describes her first introduction to her. "I arrived late at the house of a mutual friend, tea was on the table, and behind it sat a little wee dark person, dressed in black, who scarcely spoke, so that I had time for a good look at her. She had soft lightish brown hair, eyes of the same tint, looking straight at you, and very good and expressive ; reddish complexion, a wide mouth—altogether plain ; the forehead square, broad, and rather overhanging. Her hands are like birds' claws, and she is so shortsighted that she cannot see your face unless you are close to her. She is said to be frightfully shy, and almost cries at the thought of going amongst strangers." *Article: A Few Words About Jane Eyre.*

KIRKBY LONSDALE.

Rev. W. C. Wilson. — During the last few days, the Rev. Carus Wilson, has been paying a visit to Casterton Hall, his native place, after an absence of six years. His presence at Casterton, in the schools, we doubt not, would be very gratifying, and we are informed he expressed himself delighted with the manner in which they are at present conducted. He preached in the chapel of the above place on Sunday last, the 27th inst, to very crowded congregation from the words, " When the son of man cometh, will he find faith on the earth." This discourse was earnest, and eloquent, and could not fail but make a deep impression all present.

The original article https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=nyp.33433081661807&seq=372&q1=jane+eyre 1855 has a longer opening, commenting on the reception that "Jane Eyre" received when it was first published, as well as an extra closing paragraph, which was as follows:

> Such are a few particulars concerning this remarkable woman; with the broader features of her history, especially her marriage with Mr. Nicol, her father's curate, and her melancholy death six months after she (probably for the first time in her strange eventful life) knew what it was to enjoy domestic happiness — the daily press had already made everyone familiar. That she has been taken from us in the full vigour of her intellect, ere the sunshine of a happy home had fostered and developed the brighter and more genial portion of her nature, must ever be a source of regret to those who, admiring as we admire the works she has left as her lasting memorial, hoped for yet nobler proofs of her remarkable powers of invention, when time and an increased knowledge of life should have corrected the eccentricity, without lessening the originality, of her genius.
