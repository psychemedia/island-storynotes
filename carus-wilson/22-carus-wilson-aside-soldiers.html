<h1>Aside — Revd. Carus Wilson and the Soldiers’ Institutes<a class="headerlink" href="#aside-revd-carus-wilson-and-the-soldiers-institutes" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h1>
<p>Around the same time as his publication of <em>Tempters and Tempted</em> on the Island in early 1856, the Revd. W. Carus Wilson was also busy on the mainland, a short boat trip away in Portsmouth, overseeing the opening of a Soldiers’ Institute.</p>
<div class="dropdown admonition">
<p class="admonition-title">Frequent excursions to Portsmouth, <em>Memoir</em>, 1860</p>
<p><em><a class="reference external" href="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=DQ5hAAAAcAAJ">Brief memoir of the late Rev. W. Carus-Wilson</a>, reprinted by permission from “The Christian Observer” … With extracts from letters to soldiers in India, etc.</em> 1860.</p>
<p>[Rev. W. Carus Wilson] now frequently made excursions to Portsmouth for the purpose of preaching, either in the churches, the barracks, or the circus -a large building which had recently been opened for public worship. He was heard with marked interest, and it may be hoped with abiding effects, by crowded audiences. But there was one result of his largehearted benevolence and practical wisdom which will be remembered, together with the Friendly Visitor and the Clergy Daughters’ School, as the offspring of a mind gifted with the originality of genius. This was the establishment of the Soldiers’ Institute at Portsmouth. He saw that the poor soldier was beset by a fearful temptation in the total want ofmental occupation for his long intervals of leisure from duty. The natural resource was to drown the weary hours in the drunken and noisy revelry of the ale-house. He rightly judged, that as long as there was no way of escape from this temptation, all efforts to raise the moral and spiritual condition of the soldier would be in a great measure paralysed.</p>
<p>It struck him that a remedy might be found in an institution resembling the Mechanics’ and Literary Institutes which have become so general in large towns for other classes. The attempt was forthwith made. A house was taken and suitably furnished, and in a very short time the first “ Soldiers’ Institute “ was opened, with a reading-room, supplied with useful magazines and other books ; a coffee-room, where tea and coffee were supplied at very moderate prices ; and rooms where little parties could meet for the purpose of reading the Scriptures and prayer. The plan succeeded well : the Institute was hailed as a boon by numbers of the men ; and , while many contented themselves with the coffeeroom and the papers, there were not a few who were induced, by the influence and encouragement employed, to meet for reading and prayer.</p>

<p>SOLDIERS’ INSTITUTES.—</p>
<p>On the 23rd January last, the Soldiers’ Institute at Portsmouth was opened. It was described in the prospectus, a copy of which has been forwarded to us by a gentleman who takes much interest in the soldiers’ welfare, the Rev. W. Carus Wilson:—</p>
<p>“The Soldiers’ Institute comprises a reading-room, supplied with daily and weekly newspapers, and most of the  leading and useful periodicals and current literature of the day. Joined to this, a library for the exclusive use of the members, embracing works in every department in literature, as well as others that may prove useful in their profession. Class-rooms for mutual improvement, and occasional lectures, add another feature to the general object. United with the above are two coffee-rooms, which it is hoped will contribute to the comfort of the members, and tend to lessen the frequenting of public-houses. The subscription is fixed at one penny per week, for which a cheque is given, the possession of which entitles the holder to all the advantages of the institute, for so long a period as it is dated for.”</p>
<p>It will thus be seen that the Soldiers’ Institute is analagous to the Mechanics’ Institute, and is calculated to effect much good by furnishing useful employment and the means of innocent recreation during leisure hours. We heartily wish success to the Portsmouth Institute, and should be glad to see a similar plan adopted in other towns. The country would thus in some measure repay that debt which she owes to our brave soldiers.</p>

<p class="admonition-title">Opening of a Soldiers’ Institute in Portsmouth, January 1856</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0001365/18560126/104/0005">Portsmouth Times and Naval Gazette - Saturday 26 January 1856</a></p>
<p>OPENING OF A SOLDIERS’ INSTITUTE AT PORTSMOUTH.</p>
<p>On Wednesday evening a meeting was held on the opening of the Soldiers’ Institution, which has been established in King-street, Portsmouth, to afford the soldiers quartered this garrison a library, reading-room, and other conveniences, in which they can employ their time in reading, or other rational amusements during their leisure hours.</p>
<p>The Institution has been established mainly through the instrumentality the Rev. W. Carus Wilson, who first brought the subject forward, and who has been nobly seconded by the officers in the garrison.</p>
<p>Above 100 soldiers, principally of the Artillery, were present at the meeting, nearly fifty whom gave in their names members of the Institution, at the close of the meeting.</p>
<p>Captain Tate occupied the chair, and was supported the Rev. Mr. Childs, Rev. W.C. Wilson, Capt. Campbell, Capt. Savage, G. Rylands, Esq., C. Bintead, Esq. Revs. J. Knapp, J. Power, Capt. Hawke, and others, would have been there, had not circumstances prevented them.</p>
<p>The Chairman, in opening the proceedings, said that for the formation of the Institution they were greatly indebted to the philanthropic spirit of the Rev. W. C. Wilson, through whose exertions it had been brought forward. In the Institution the soldier would find every comfort—newspapers, library, coffee rooms, and every means of rational instruction and amusement, which he hoped would keep many from the haunts which abounded in the town, and lead them to understand that a vicious course of life was incompatible with true happiness. (Cheers.)</p>
<p>Rev. Mr. Childs said he would endeavour to place before the meeting the object they had in view in forming the institute. He formerly lived in a garrison town ( Devonport) for some time, and well knew what inducements were held out to young men in such towns to lead them into wrong paths, and the necessity there existed for the formation of some counteracting influence. The rev. gentlemen then pointed out to the meeting the hideousness of vice, by relating an incident which occurred during his residence Devonport. It was at the death-bed of a woman, who some years previously had been instrumental in causing a marine—her companion in vice—to be transported for a felony, which she, herself, had committed. He described the fearful effects produced by conscience in her last moments, and continued: Their object in forming the institution was to provide them with a “Clubhouse,” as it might called, where, when they left their barracks, they might have a lounge, read the papers, and perhaps meet a friend—where they might smoke their pipe, spin a yarn, and fight their battles over again. (Cheers.) If they did not like smoking, there was another room where they could have a quiet cup of coffee, and a comfortable chat with a companion. The room they were now in was the general room, where they would have placed upon a table all the news of the day, by which they might watch their companions in arms fighting for their country in other lands. (Cheers.) They would also have library and class rooms, where he hoped they would get mutual instruction amongst themselves. They did not want see them crammed with lectures, but see them gathering honey for themselves. That was a great fault in Mechanics’ Institutes; they gave information, without teaching men to exert themselves; it was if they crammed the stomach without causing them to earn their bread by the sweat of the brow. If they did the latter, they were better in physical health, and if they strove to learn themselves they would be better in mental health. (Hear, hear.) They wanted to see them form classes amongst themselves, in which those who were well instructed might help the others. It was also desired that they should have the management of the institution in their own hands ; that a committee of management should be formed out of the members. As there was a United Service Club, so they wished to form a kind of club for the troops in garrison, and upon its auspicious opening he begged to congratulate them. (Applause.)</p>
</div>
<p>During the opening, it seems the Reverend W. Carus Wilson was the star turn. His opening provides some context as one the reasons why Carus Wilson felt such an institution was required:</p>
<div class="dropdown admonition">
<p class="admonition-title">Contributing to the comfort and happiness of the soldier</p>
<p>Rev W. Carus Wilson, who in rising was received with much applause, said that whatever they did in the way of contributing to the comfort and happiness of the soldier, was only the payment of a moiety of the debt of gratitude which they owed the brave defenders of our country, and which had been much increased during these critical time. He had long seen the necessity of the formation of such institutions and he must say that, although he had taken part in various undertakings, none had given him greater pleasure and satisfaction than the little efforts which he had been able to put forth on behalf of the soldier. He had been much abroad of late years, and had caused many thousand Bibles to circulated in Italy, especially amongst Sardinian soldiers. He should not enlarge upon this subject, as he had promissed to attend a meeting of the Soldiers’ Friend Society the following Wednesday evening, when he hoped to give much interesting information respecting his labours in that field; he would therefore simply state that the work had been eminently successful ; both officers and soldiers had taken an interest in it and that at the camp at Boulogne, as well as in Italy, many thousands of Bibles, besides innumerable tracts, had been circulated amongst the soldiery.</p>
</div>
<p>With the opening speaker having described some of the direct benefits to members of the institute, Carus Wilson took the opportunity to review of the “collateral” advantages:</p>
<div class="dropdown admonition">
<p class="admonition-title">Collateral advantages</p>
<p>After speaking of the assistance he had received in the latter piece from the Rev. Mr Brown, the reverend gentleman said that it was a great delight to his mind to meet them that evening, but it was not necessary for him dwell on the advantages of the institution, as that had been so ably done by Mr. Childs, but he would remark that there were many collateral as well as direct advantages attendant upon it. He was glad to see the assimilation of ranks which it produced—that whilst the officer had his club-house, the soldier should have the same, for there was something exceedingly interesting in the fact that men of all ranks and classes were likely to be provided for. He hoped, however, they were as but the commencement of the work, for it was his longing desire to see the “The Soldier’s Institute “ made as perfect as possible, not only because this was the largest garrison town in the kingdom, but as an encouragement to other places to follow their example. (Cheers.) Some friends at Dover had already made application to him to assist in forming one for the barracks at that town, and he was sure he should find willing helpers there. (Hear, hear.) It would be gratifying to them to know that the proceedings were receiving countenance, not only from the officers of the army universally, but from higher quarters.— Lord Panmure having expressed himself favourable to them. (Applause.) The rev. gentleman then read a letter which had been addressed to Lord Panmure by a military chaplain; it spoke of the temptations to which the soldier was subjected, and remarked that although they could not expect to remove these altogether, it was their duty to do what they could to counteract their influence, and recommended the adoption of a plan similar to that carried out in the formation of the Portsmouth Soldiers’ Institute; he said that the ordinary library in the barrack was not sufficiently attractive; something on the principle of a <em>café</em> being the <em>desideratum</em>. This, continued the speaker, had met with the full approval of Lord Panmure, and whilst considering that they had commenced under very favourable auspices, he hoped to see the day when no garrison town in England would be destitute of such an institution.</p>
</div>
<p>He also wished to make it clear what he thought were the benefits of having the institute separate from the barracks, and the comforts that could be enjoyed their:</p>
<div class="dropdown admonition">
<p class="admonition-title">Best to have it distinct from the barracks</p>
<p>There was one point he would wish to refer to with to with respect to the collateral advantages of the institution. He thought it best to have it distinct from the barracks, as it would be a greater change for the soldiers, and it would enable them to fraternise with soldiers of other regiments; it would bring them out from the contracted limit of their own little circle, so that they might compare notes with one another. He thought this an important feature in the institution. (Cheers.) He perfectly agreed in the sentiments of the chaplain in the letter he had read—“No acts of Parliament, no efforts of their own, would keep men from evil, or lead them to good;” but although that was certain, they should do what they could. Men’s minds were always seeking after happiness and enjoyment, and they should give such a spirit every encouragement in a rational way. In the institution they were now such would be found, and they could enjoy their pipe and tobacco at their ease. With regard to smoking, that had been a debated point, but it was ultimately decided that such should be allowed to all who wished to pursue it. In the library they would find books of all kinds, but although they were not all religious books, he would not disguise from them that the great object they had in view was to make them true soldiers of the Cross, for there could be no true happiness without holiness. Many other things would be given them, and they might rest assured that if they found the premises too straight for them, they should be widened—(cheers)—for they would not rest content without endeavouring to promote their happiness, and he would conclude with expressing the earnest hope that God’s blessing would rest upon them and their undertaking.</p>
</div>
<p>There were then some votes of thanks given by the Chairman, along with other words of support:</p>
<div class="dropdown admonition">
<p class="admonition-title">A hearty thanks</p>
<p>Captain Savage being compelled to take his departure, the Chairman said, that previous to his doing so, he was sure they would all join in giving to him their hearty thanks for the part he had taken in the undertaking. (Loud applause.) Had it not been for the hearty co-operation of Capt. Savage and other officers, all the efforts of Rev. Mr. Wilson would have been unavailing.</p>
<p>The proposition was carried with acclamation.</p>
<p>Captain Campbell would only say a few words, as so much had been said the objects of the institution previous speakers. Thirty years ago, when in India, he could not help noticing the demoralising character of the army, and he therefore congratulated them that they lived in different times. He hoped they would appreciate the benefits of the institution, and that the present building would be found too small for them, when they would find better accommodation for them in another place. (Cheers.) He would always happy to contribute his mite, and would conclude by wishing prosperity to the undertaking. (Loud applause.)</p>
</div>
<p>Carus Wilson, it seems, was not the sort of person to let an opportunity to say “one more thing” go unmissed, and took to the floor again to suggest the benefits that such institutions could have on soldiers’ behaviour. Several other clergymen added their observations about the moral fight that soldiers were engaged in.</p>
<div class="dropdown admonition">
<p class="admonition-title">The earthly and spiritual fight</p>
<p>Rev. W. C. Wilson said there was one little fact which he would like to mention. A friend of his, the late Colonel Hewlett, who fell at the attack the Bedan, stated to him some time ago, that whereas out of his regiment of 850 men, there were formerly 30 in a morning who were brought before him in consequence of having “got into a scrape,” since they had formed an institution with a library, &amp;c., for the use of the regiment, they had dwindled down to six or eight. (Applause.) He hoped none in that room would got into such awkward predicaments.</p>
<p>Rev. W. C. Wilson, again rising, said he would remark that if any of the members wished to have any alteration or improvement made, their suggestions would receive the utmost attention.</p>
<p>Rev. Mr. Childs said that it was desired that a practical committee should be formed out of their own body, he would recommend them to consult together to recommend one from each company or corps, in whom they had confidence, on that committee.</p>
<p>Rev. W. C. Wilson read a most beautiful and affecting letter which he had received from soldier at Malta; every word in it breathe a spirit of religious principle, which it was truly delightful to listen to.</p>
<p>Rev. W. Livingstone, after remarking on the practice now observed by the greater portion of the clergy of this country, of offering up prayers for the safety of our soldiers during the war, which he stated originated with the Rev. Mr. Wilson, said that the institution had been established to draw the soldiers from the sources of temptation to which was subjected to enable him meet in place where might enjoy himself without danger to his morals, with friends belonging to other regiments, so as to promote that spirit of brotherhood which it was so cheering to behold. He remembered not long ago, reading a work in which the writer said the glory of England’s greatness had departed, that in the event another she would have no men who could maintain her honour, but he thought that when 8,000 Englishmen kept 25,000 Russians at bay for several hours, there was the same enthusiasm, the same unswerving indomitable bravery in them that there ever was (cheers); indeed, he believed more bravery had been shown in the Crimea than at any time in the Peninsula. (Loud applause.) But whilst they had shown such bravery in an earthly fight, there was a spiritual conflict with the powers darkness, which with God’s grace, they should carry on strongly and heroically, and he hoped that the establishment of this institution would enable them carry on that fight with success, and prayed that as they had met together that evening, they would meet together before the throne of grace.</p>
</div>
<p>The meeting then turned to a consideration of the governance of the institute, and again Carus Wilson had a say, not least in justifying the costs, and the direct benefits, of members.</p>
<div class="dropdown admonition">
<p class="admonition-title">The rules of the institution</p>
<p>G. Rylands, Esq., as one of the Committee, said that other classes of the community had institutions and associations in which they met together for mutual improvement; and so when Mr. Wilson proposed the establishment of soldier’s institute, they thought it but right that the soldier should possess the same advantages. (Cheers.) He hoped they would distinctly understand that their wish was that the institution should be under the control of the members themselves; and they hoped that if there was any paper placed upon the table which a majority of them did not approve of, or any other which they would like have, they would inform them of it, and their wishes would be complied with. The time which the institution should be opened would also be left for them decide upon. Every suggestion they might make, which would add to their comfort or convenience, would be attended to, as the Committee wished to make it a model institution from which other towns might take a copy. (Hear, hear.) As had been remarked by former speakers, they would find the table in the room in which they were sitting covered with magazines; the library filled with useful and entertaining books; class rooms, and lecture rooms; they might also, if they preferred it, have some one read to them. Every thing that was possible to be accomplished would be done to afford them instruction; and he hoped that not only every one present would join, but that each would induce a comrade go with him. (Applause.)</p>
<p>Rev. C. Wilson, after stating that the rules of the institution admitted all soldiers in the garrison to its benefits on payment of a 1d. per week, said that coffee also would furnished at the lowest possible price. He had determined to be the first to taste the coffee made in the institution, and he must say that he never tasted any better in England. (Applause.) The committee had also decided on opening the institution on the Sunday, not for reading the newspapers, or anything of a secular character, but for admittance to the religious works in the library, &amp;c. (Applause.) To make the work quite complete, the institution would be furnished with materials for amusement (but not for gambling) in the shape of draught and chess boards and men, backgammon, and a bagatelle board (cheers); these would be supplied with the understanding that, directly or indirectly, no gambling would be allowed. if one set of any of these was not found to be sufficient, he was sure the Committee would gladly furnish more. (Applause.)</p>
<p>A vote of thanks was then given to the Secretary, Mr. Batchelor, and the Chairman; and G. Rylands, Esq., having stated that a gentleman (Mr. D. Barker), agent of Soldiers’ Friend Society, had come down from Winchester and attended the meeting to obtain some information preparatory to forming a similar institution in that town.</p>
<p>The meeting separated, about fifty, as we before stated, giving in their names as members.</p>
