# A Barracks Town

It's the mid 1850s, and Britain is one of the allied forces sending off her young men to fight in the Crimea. In Newport, on the Isle of Wight, the troops are temporarily stationed in Parkhurst Barracks before making their way to Portsmouth, and the troop ships that await them.

For the young soldiers, many of them in their late teens or early twenties, entertainment is to be found in the public houses of Newport, and the arms of the women who ply their trade there.

## Local bye-laws

In the 1850s, disorderly conduct in the public streets had been regulated by the [Vagrancy Act, 1824](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1824/83/pdfs/ukpga_18240083_en.pdf), which included the following clause:

> ... every Common Prostitute wandering in the public Streets or public Highways, or in any Place of public Resort, and behaving in a riotous or indecent Manner;  ... , shall be deemed an idle and disorderly Person within the true Intent and Meaning of this Act.

Town Commissioners could also adopt regulations defined in the [Town Police Clauses Act 1847](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1847/89/pdfs/ukpga_18470089_en.pdf) as local Bye_laws. Among other things, this allowed them, to explicitly regulate, amongst other things, bad language and disordely conduct:

> XXVIII. Every Person who in any Street, to the Obstruction, Annoyance, or Danger of the Residents or Passengers, commits any of the following Offences, shall be liable to a Penalty not exceeding Forty Shillings for each Offence, or, in the Discretion of the justice before whom he is convicted, may be committed to Prison, there to remain for a Period not exceeding Fourteen Days, and any Constable or other Officer appointed by virtue of this or the special Act shall take into Custody, without Warrant, and, forthwith convey before a Justice, any Person who within his View commits any such Offence ; (that is to say,) ...
> 
> - Every Person who publicly offers for Sale or Distribution, or exhibits to public View, any profane, indecent, or obscene Book, Paper, Print, Drawing, Painting, or Representation, or sings any profane or obscene Song or Ballad, or uses any profane or obscene Language
> 
> - Every common Prostitute or Nightwalker loitering and importuning Passengers for the Purpose of Prostitution

Drunken behaviour could also be targeted:

> XXIX. Every Person drunk in any Street, and guilty of any riotous or indecent Behaviour therein, and also every Person guilty of any violent or indecent Behaviour in any Police Office or any Police Station House within the Limits of the special Act, shall be liable to a Penalty not exceeding Forty Shillings for every such Offence, or, in the Discretion of the Justice before whom he is convicted, to Imprisonment for a Period not exceeding Seven Days.

In addition, the owners of establishments that might encourage or facilitate disorderly conduct could also be prosecuted:

> XXXV. Every Person keeping any House, Shop, Room, or other Place of public Resort within the Limits of the special Act for the Sale or Consumption of Refreshments of any Kind who knowingly suffers common Prostitutes or reputed Thieves to assemble at and continue in his Premises shall, for every such Offence, be liable to a Penalty not exceeding Five Pounds.

https://www.oldscottish.com/statutes-c.html

The Contagious Diseases Acts were introduced in the 1860s for the compulsory examination of women believed to be common prostitutes for their hospitalisation (known as lock hospitals or lock wards) should they be diagnosed suffering from a contagious disease within the meaning of the Acts. The Acts were in reaction to fears that service men were vulnerable to infection from associating with prostitutes and that the Acts would apply to garrison towns and naval ports frequented by prostitutes. The Act of 1864 (27 and 28 Victoria C85) identified the following towns falling within the remit of the Act: Chatham, Colchester, Cork, Curragh, Portsmouth, Plymouth, Shorncliffe, Woolwich. The Act of 1866 (29 and 30 Victoria C96) added Canterbury, Devonport, Dover, Gravesend, Maidstone, Southampton and Winchester. The Act of 1873 did not stipulate particular towns or areas.


TH: neither Newport nor Parkhurst nor Albany get a mention.

## Parkhurst Barracks

Parkurst (Albany) Barracks were located on the northern edge of Newport, next door to Parkhurst prison, opened in December 1838 as an establishment for young male offenders, on the turnpike road to (West) Cowes.

```{admonition} Parkhurst Apprentices
:class: seealso

Accordinng to Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkhurst_apprentices):

> The Parkhurst apprentices, juveniles from a reformatory attached to Parkhurst Prison on the Isle of Wight, were sentenced to "transportation beyond the seas" and transported to Australia and New Zealand between 1842 and 1852. Either before leaving England or on arrival at their destination, they were pardoned on the conditions that they be "apprenticed" to local employers, and that they not return to England during the term of their sentence. In the ten years between 1842 and 1852 nearly 1500 boys aged from twelve to eighteen were transported to Australia and New Zealand from Parkhurst Prison.

As a garrison town, soldiers from a wide variety of regiments were stationed at Parkhurst Barracks, often *en route* to the Crimea via troop ships sailing out of Portsmouth. The muster appears to have reached about 1,300 officers and men at any one time, many of them young men in their teens or early twenties.

Troops were landed at Fountain Quay in Cowes, and then marched south to Parkhurst Barracks. The road on into Newport would have entered the town at Hunny-hill.

A brief report in the *Hampshire Telegraph* of Saturday, 11th October, 1856, extimates the muster at the barracks at about 1300 men.

The military depots at Parkhurst Barracks, in the Isle of Wight, muster about 1,300 men and officers. A number of the men have volunteered recently into the Military Train, which is the name of a permanent corps that is to be a substitute for the Land Transport Corps. The military train is to number about 3,000, and the head-quarters is at Bristol. As soon as there is any large number of volunteers at Parkhurst they are sent under an escort to that city.

Reports occasionally appeared in the local press announcing the latest troop movements in and out of Parkhurst Barracks.

Owing to the severity of the weather, our poor would have fared badly had it not been for the liberality of the wealthy. As it is, coals, bread, and other comforts have been distributed among the necessitous, and an intimation given that whilst the cold continued the wants of the needy would not be forgotten nor disregarded.

During the week we have had fresh arrivals of recruits for Parkhurst Barracks, and several hundred soldiers of different regiments have left for Portsmouth *en route* for the Crimea, all of whom wore a cheerful countenance and did not appear at all depressed at leaving England; but on the contrary, they cheered lustily, and vowed they would give a good account oft the Russians if they should have the good luck to meet them.

Visitors continue to arrive daily in considerable numbers in the Isle of Wight, the coaches appear well laden, and carriages of all descriptions are again in motion ; lodgings are getting in request, and in Newport many are occupied by military officers and their families, in consequence of the quarters at Parkhurst not affording accommodation for the number.

Large drafts of men and a considerable number of officers have lately left Parkhurst Barracks for the Crimea, who have been replaced by fresh arrivals, so that the Barracks are quite full at the present time. The Isle of Wight Militia Artillery, upwards of 100 strong, were under orders to be billetted at Ryde, so as to make room for the 48th Regiment in Newport, but the order was afterwards countermanded.
