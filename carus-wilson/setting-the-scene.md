# A Barracks Town

It's the mid 1850s, and Britain is one of the allied forces sending off her young men to fight in the Crimea. In Newport, on the Isle of Wight, the troops are temporarily barracked in Parkhurst Barracks before making their way to Portsmouth, and the troop ships that await them.

For the young soldiers, many of them in their late teens or early twenties, entertainment is to be found in the public houses of Newport, and the arms of the young women who ply their trade there.
