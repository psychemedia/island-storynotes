Newport, Jan 4th

At our Guildhall, on Saturday, the 28th ult. ...

An information was laid against Thornas Long, a coachman at Ryde, who keeps a retail beer-house in the neighbourhood, charging him with having, on the 24th ultimo, kept his house after ten o'clock at night, the time allowed by the Magistrates, whereby he had Incurred the penalty of 5l. Long, who bears a good character, was laid up with the gout and not able to attend; his wife (Mary Long) on hearing her husband called, stepped into the box. and on being asked if guilty or not, pleaded not guilty. Mr. Hearn, having proved that Long's house was licensed, and that ten o'clock was the time to close at night by order of the Magistrates, called Nathaniel Ashford. the chief constable at Ryde, who, being sworn, stated that he was sent for on the night of the 24th Dec. by Mrs. Long, to the Horse and Groom. I went there, it was just after eleven at night when I went first. I found several people fighting, and forty or fifty outside, many were stripped fighting, and the blood flying in all directions. I requested them to depart, and in about twenty minutes they dispersed. There were people in the dancing room, and Farrow, the fiddler was there; I cleared the room and then went round the town, when I returned I again found people in the house who were not travellers; there was Dore. Cotton, and Mew there; it is a disorderly house, and is frequently complained of, and what I complain of is when the constables have cleared the house and the doors are locked and we are gone, the house is again opened to admit company; when I went the second time there were several men outside with Mrs. Long's daughters, the door was not fastened, and others were inside. The Chairman of the Magistrates, in the course of a very suitable address to Mrs. Long, expressed his sorrow that she should keep a house of such ill fame, and while her husband was behaving well at his work, she was disgracing him by her dlsorderly conduct at home. Fined 5l.

Henry Scott. of Chale, another retailer of beer had a similar information laid against him for having his house open after ten o'clock on the 24th December. John Spanner, sworn:— I am tything man of Chale, at ten minutes before twelve on the night of the 24th, I went to Scolt's house, found several people there and cups on the table; I asked him If he knew what time it was, and he said yes. I did not go there a second time but heard that they were fighting outside his house at one in the morning. I told him the week before how It would be If he did not shut up his house in proper time. -Though Scott pleaded guilty at first, he now called a witness, apparently to clear himself of the charge, but he got him further into the scrape, for his witness, Thomae Dore, admitted he went there between six and seven in the evening, and stayed there till twelve wilh many others, and he knew it was twelve by Scott's clock, but said, we never had nothing in the world to drink after Spanner came to the door, which wa. half-past ten.— Convicted In the penalty of 2l. 10s.

Parkhurst apprentices

"The Parkhurst apprentices, juveniles from a reformatory attached to Parkhurst Prison on the Isle of Wight, were sentenced to "transportation beyond the seas" and transported to Australia and New Zealand between 1842 and 1852. Either before leaving England[1] or on arrival at their destination,[2] they were pardoned on the conditions that they be "apprenticed" to local employers, and that they not return to England during the term of their sentence. In the ten years between 1842 and 1852 nearly 1500 boys aged from twelve to eighteen were transported to Australia and New Zealand from Parkhurst Prison."

The Isle of WIght: Its Past and Present and...
Mudie
p131
"The Isle of Wight cannot strictly be said to have any history of its own, as distinct from that of England, of which it always formed a part since England was a kingdom."
On the traditional accounts of it in the early times
no reliance can be placed, because we do not know that they have been handed down from anything like authentic sources, or have had their origin at the time of the events
to which they relate. We must farther bear in mind, that oral traditions are exceedingly treacherous matters, even in those case where there is no motive, and therefore no imaginable intention, to deceive. W e know that, in the case of any event which makes an impression and becomes a tale of the day, scarcely any two relaters of that tale, even though they have been eye-witnesses of that which they relate, give their relations in the same manner. This is the case, to a very considerable extent, even among those who are well-educated, can discriminate between truth and false hood, and are regarded as persons of probity; and, if this holds among them — as it does hold in every instance where a thorough investigation can be made, much more must it hold among the ignorant- as proneness to exaggeration is the invariable character of persons of this description."

The termination of the expedition was most disastrous; the whole
force perishing at the batle of St.Aubin, and only one boy surviving to carry home the tale."

Having, in opposition to the wishes of Henry VII., raised a force of 40 gentlemen and 400 yeomen of the island, picturesquely clad in white coats with broad red crosses, he joined the Duke's forces — a portion of whom assumed the same dress to deceive the enemy into the belief that the English allies were more numerous than they really were — and engaged the King's army under La Tremouille, July 20,1488. La Tremouille gained a complete and sanguinary victory: Woodville's whole force was cut to pieces with the exception of a boy, who carried the disastrous intelligence to his native isle. So overwhelming a calamity had never fallen on the Isle of Wight; all its noblest and best were swept away at one blow, and there was scarce a single family which had nut personal cause for lamentation.

p373-4 Edward the First and his two successors reserved the
title of "lord of the island" to themselves, governing by
"custodes" or "wardens,"who were often changed, the office being not unfrequently in commission. ... On the accession of Richard II the lordship was again
granted to a subject,... and from this period till the final ces sation of the office in the reign of Henry VII., the roll of "Lords of the Wight" contains the names of some of the highest persons in the realm.
p374 On the disastrous termination of Sir Edward Woodville's rash expedition to Britanny, the title ceased; and the Crown, sensible of the importance of the office, never again be
stowed it upon a subject. The government of the island
became a mere military appointment, and the"Captain,"or "Governor," ashe was afterwards styled, was answerable to
the sovereign for the due discharge of his duties.

p383 The low fortunes of the island received a stil more terrible blow forty years later, in the disastrous issue of Woodville's rash expedition to Britanny, which robbed it of al its bravest and best. An ordinance was immediately passed by Parliament, prohibiting any persons to hold lands, &c., of more than the annual value of ten marks, in order that the isle, which was then "desolate and not inhabited, but occupied with beasts and cattle," might be again peopled and able to defend itself from an invader.

p118 Fitz Osborne pursued in the Isle of Wight the same course
of conduct towards the Church, which his master and
relative, the Conqueror, had adopted on the mainland. Like many of the Norman nobles and gentry, Fitz Osborne was what would be now called a strong churchman; in 1045 he had founded the Abbey of Lire, or Lyra, in the diocese of Evreux in Normandy, where also he was the founder of the Abbey of Coulanges, in which he died. As was the case with most of the Norman abbeys, a legend is attached to the foundation of Lire, which can be read in the
church history of Normandy {A\'t/s/rm Pia, p. 545). The monk William of Poitiers says that Normandy was an Egypt,
a Thebaid, as regarded monasteries. Duke William of Normandy, so the same writer tells us, never refused his authorization to any one desirous of giving to churches. 'He built
so Ordericus affirms. A com-
many monasteries,'

the clergy, and good friends of the clergy (at the beginning at least), suj)ported the ('hurch. It appears from Domesday Book, the great authority on the condition of England at the period of the Conquest, that William Fitz Osborne gave to his

Soon after they arrived at the little town of Brading; and Mrs. Merton and Agnes went to visit the Church, while Mr. Merton rested for an hour or two at the inn. As they entered the church-yard, they saw, to their great joy, their old acquaintance Mr. Bevan, whom they had not seen before since they left Carisbrook Castle. He told them he had been staying at Newport; but that he had now come to Brading to see the Church, which was the oldest in the island, part of it being said to have been built in the year 704. "It is also large for the Isle of Wight, which is remarkable for the smallness of its churches," continued he; "and it contains some curious old tombs of the Oglanders, the founder of whose family came over with William the Conqueror; also the original of the epitaph which has been so often quoted, beginning: 4 Forgive, blest shade! the tributary tear* — I do not remember the rest, but the words are doubtless familiar to you."

...

He then endeavoured to turn their attention to another subject, and began speaking of Brading Haven.

"The sea here," said he, "spreads over a piece of land eight or nine hundred acres in extent, which, tradition tells us, was formerly partly covered with an extensive oak forest, in which the Druids performed their rites. In the centre of the forest was a stone-cased well, in which Merlin, who was a powerful magician, had confined a troublesome water-spirit; and the exact situation of this well was kept a secret, as it was said, that if ever the lid was raised, ruin to the whole country round would follow. The time of the Druids passed away, and all memory of the well was lost, till the time of William the Conqueror, when the Norman knight, Fitz Osborne, who subdued the island and reigned over it as an independent sovereign, gave this tract of land to one of his followers, Robert Okelandro. This knight, being fond of hunting, determined to clear away the underwood in the forest, and in doing so he discovered the enchanted well, and ordered its cover to be removed that it might be filled up; some of the oldest inhabitants of the place remonstrated; but he would be obeyed; the cover was taken off, and the waters rushed up with such force as to overwhelm the whole district, and to drown the adventurous knight and several of his attendants."

LANDGUARD
LANDGUARD (Levegarestun, xi cent.; Langred, xiii cent.) is perhaps to be identified with Levegarestun, which was held of the Confessor as an alod by two freemen, and belonged in 1086 to William son of Azor. (fn. 184) It was held of the honour of Carisbrooke in the 13th and 14th centuries, but was said in 1582 to be held of the manor of Wolverton. (fn. 185) In the latter half of the 13th century it was held with Wolverton by Robert de Glamorgan, (fn. 186) but had perhaps previously been held by Geoffrey Tichborne, who had given land in Landguard to the chaplains of Limerstone (fn. 187) (q.v.). It appears to have passed with Wolverton until 1431. (fn. 188) At the beginning of the 16th century the manors of Landguard and Watchingwell were held by Thomas Baker and his wife Joan, and came to their daughter Joan wife of John Earlisman, on whose death in 1542 the property was divided between her two daughters, Landguard being assigned to Jane, the wife of Edward Hungerford. After her husband's death Jane married Edward Moore, and the two in June 1572 granted 'the site and capital messuage and farm-place of the manor of Langorde' to Richard Cooke of Chale for the term of 100 years. (fn. 189) Edward Moore and Jane remained in possession until 1574, (fn. 190) but they probably left no issue, as the manor passed to John Cheke, probably son of Jane's sister Joan Cheke (see Watchingwell). John died seised of it, then called the manor of North Landguard, in 1582, leaving a son Edward. (fn. 191) This estate afterwards seems to have passed to Sir John Richards, who died seised of it in 1626, leaving a son John. (fn. 192) The further descent of this estate has not been traced.

A second manor later known as Great Landguard belonged to the Knights, Michael Knight dying seised of it in 1612. (fn. 193) This estate then passed with Luccombe in Bonchurch to Mr. Arthur Harry Howard Atherley, (fn. 194) who is the present owner.

The old house, a 17th-century stone structure, with a later Georgian brick front, was pulled down in 1879 and rebuilt by the present owner's father, Lieut.-Col. Atherley.



THE ISLE OF WIGHT Clinch
p99-100 There is a curious dole left, it is said, by Isabella, the heiress of this manor in the reign
of Henry I. The legend, which may possibly be fabulous, is as follows: When she lay dying
Langred (Languard), given
she prayed her husband to set aside for the poor as much land as would enable her to institute a dole of bread to all who came to the gates of Tichborne on Sir
every Lady Day.
Roger thereupon took a brand from the hearth and
promised her as much land as she could encircle whilst the wood was burning. She caused rebuilding.
The house is situated on rather low
herself to be carried from her bed to a place
still pointed out, and began creeping on her hands and knees; and in this way she encircled,
before the brand was consumed, a plot of ground twenty-three acres in extent, still known as the Crawels.

p177 Smuggler's retreat / shibeen
Whitwell
One of the small cottages in the lower part of the village, once used as the village post office, during the i8th century was widely known as the "smugglers' retreat," and kept open as a shebeen or "pop" shop, where smuggled spirits could be obtained at a cheap rate. Being an unlicensed house, it was closed later by the lord of the manor. A legendary story attaches to the house, connected with the little spring of water, still seen issuing from a recess in the stone wall, close to, but below the ground level of the house. The story is as follows: "At the base of the down above and on its northern aspect, is a farmstead placed in the valley and situated a short distance off the road to the right, leading from St. Lawrence to Whitwell. In the farm yard is the usual pond, on which a brood of ducks—one of these being a fancy breed —were accustomed to swim about and disport themselves. One morning the latter was missing, and early next day it was reported that the missing duck had been found lying in an exhausted condition by the spring near the cottage. From this fact it was positively asserted that the duck had fallen into the well at the farm, and found its way under- ground to St.Lawrence, a mile and a half distant." From this circumstance, the house obtained its later name as the "Duck." The sign of the "Dog and Duck" was a common public house sign in the 17th century, and had reference to a sport in vogue at that period, which consisted in seeing ducks hunted in a pond by spaniels. The pleasure arose from watching the bird escape from the dog's mouth by diving.

The house obtained further notoriety from being the residence of a well-known and successful leader in the local contraband trade, and thither all the local free traders resorted. Captain H maintained intimate relations with the opposite coast, crossing the Channel frequently in his dealings with France and Holland. A story is told which throws a side-light on the social aspects of village life at this period. A vessel—commonly known as a "Dutch Dogger"—lay anchored off the shore fronting the village one Sunday morning and attracted the villagers on board, for the purpose of obtaining spirits, or, possibly to aid in removing the cargo. When the minister arrived for the usual service, the clerk said: "It be no use opening th' church, ail th' folks begone aboard the dogger." The clerk was an old man named
Thos. Paine, living at the "Duck" public-house. His successor, "old John Green," combined the office of parish clerk with that of schoolmaster. He was widely known for his poetical effusions, and currently credited with maintaining more than a passively sympathetic relation with the contrabandists of the day. There was no church-house, and old John occupied the cottage still standing nearly opposite the church. This served a double purpose as vestry and schoolroom. Here, the rector had to robe himself, putting on a white surplice over his black gown. The arrangements for the religious service were of the primitive type customary in small parish churches at that period. The pulpit and reading desk were combined and the clerk sat under. The rector led the singing, and after reciting the first verse of the hymn before the sermon, dis- appeared from view, sitting down on a low stool, to disrobe himself of the white surplice and to reappear in the black gown in which he concluded the service.

godeton livers ?? abbey ?? corruption of Lyra?

Undercliff of Isle of Wight, p264
his inference is strengthened by the fact of the church being one of the six benefices presented by the first Lord of the Island to the Norman abbey of Lyra soon after the conquest took place—^between 1066 and 1071—^probably for the very reason that the benefice was a valuable one.
