Parkhurst apprentices

"The Parkhurst apprentices, juveniles from a reformatory attached to Parkhurst Prison on the Isle of Wight, were sentenced to "transportation beyond the seas" and transported to Australia and New Zealand between 1842 and 1852. Either before leaving England[1] or on arrival at their destination,[2] they were pardoned on the conditions that they be "apprenticed" to local employers, and that they not return to England during the term of their sentence. In the ten years between 1842 and 1852 nearly 1500 boys aged from twelve to eighteen were transported to Australia and New Zealand from Parkhurst Prison."

THe Isle of WIght: Its Past and Present and...
Mudie
p131
"The Isle of Wight cannot strictly be said to have any history of its own, as distinct from that of England, of which it always formed a part since England was a kingdom."
On the traditional accounts of it in the early times
no reliance can be placed, because we do not know that they have been handed down from anything like authentic sources, or have had their origin at the time of the events
to which they relate. We must farther bear in mind, that oral traditions are exceedingly treacherous matters, even in those case where there is no motive, and therefore no imaginable intention, to deceive. W e know that, in the case of any event which makes an impression and becomes a tale of the day, scarcely any two relaters of that tale, even though they have been eye-witnesses of that which they relate, give their relations in the same manner. This is the case, to a very considerable extent, even among those who are well-educated,can discriminate between truth and false hood , and are regarded as persons of probity ; and, if this holds among them — as it does hold in every instance where a thorough investigation can be made, much more must it
hold among the ignorant- as proneness to exaggeration is the invariable character of persons of this description."

The termination of the expedition was most disastrous; the whole

p377 The next great calamity from which the island suffered,
from which indeed it was slow in recovering,was not an
invasion of French foes ,but an il-judged attempt on the part of the then “Lord,” Sir Edward Woodville, to carry terror into the ranks of their old enemies by actively espousing
the cause of the Duke of Brittany against Charles VIII. Having , in opposition to the wishes of Henry VII . , raised a force of 40 gentlemen and 400 yeomen of the island, picturesquely clad in white coats with broad red crosses, he
joined the Duke's forces — a portion of whom assumed the same
dress to deceive the enemy into the belief that the English
allies were more numerous than they really were — and
engaged the King's army under La Tremouille, July 20,1488. La Tremouille gained a complete and sanguinary victory:
Woodville's whole force was cut to pieces with the exception of a boy, who carried the disastrous intelligence to his native isle. So overwhelming a calamity had never fallen on the Isle of Wight ; all its noblest and best were swept away at one blow , and there was scarce a single family which had nut personal cause for lamentation .
p373-4 Edward the First and his two successors reserved the
title of " lord of the island ” to themselves, governing by
"custodes” or “wardens,"who were often changed, the ofice being not unfrequently in commission. ... On the accession of Richard II the lordship was again
granted to a subject,... and from this period till the final ces sation of the office in the reign of Henry VII., the roll of “ Lords of the Wight" contains the names of some of the highest persons in the realm.
p374 On the disastrous termination of Sir Edward Woodville's rash expedition to Britanny, the title ceased; and the Crown, sensible of the importance of the office, never again be
stowed it upon a subject. The government of the island
became a mere military appointment, and the"Captain,”or “Governor," ashe was afterwards styled, was answerable to
the sovereign for the due discharge of his duties.

p383 The low fortunesofthe island received a stil more terrible blow forty years later,in the disastrous issue of Woodville's rash expedition to Britanny, which robbed it of al its bravest and best. An ordinance was immediately passed by Parliament, prohibiting any persons to hold lands, &c.,of more than the annual value of ten marks, in order that the isle, which was then “desolate and not inhabited, but occupied with beasts and cattle,” might be again peopled and able to defend itself from an invader.

p190 Boniface Wishing Well
He will visit the Well - St. Bonny's or The Wishing Well — which once bubbled brightly out of the chalky bosom of the hill, but is now reduced to a sandy pool. It was first discovered, says the legend, by a certain bishop, who,riding across the hill on a misty night, lost his way, and found his steed, to his horror, slowly sliding down the precipitous side, until at length he suddenly drew up with his hoofs
fixed in the hollow of this well. The bishop thereupon vowed to St. Boniface that if he reached the bottom securely he would dedicate to his honour an acre of land. The saint closed with the bargain ; the bishop reached home without further let or mishap; and the land, known as The Bishop's Acre,still belongs to the glebe of Bonchurch. It lies at the foot of the hill, and is marked out by a ridge of turf.
In the old times, on the feast-day of St. Boniface, the village maidens were wont to ascend the down and place garlands of flowers about the well, in honour of the patron saint. A superstition attached to it,that a wish breathed inwardly by the stranger who for the first time drank of its water, would assuredly be fulfilled,- a pleasant enough fancy, which the lads and lasses of Bonchurch doubtlessly, in their love-making days, turned to good account.

p118  Fitz Osborne pursued in the Isle of Wight the same course
of conduct towards the Church, which his master and
relative, the Conqueror, had adopted on the mainland. Like many of the Norman nobles and gentry, Fitz Osborne was what would be now called a strong churchman; in 1045 he had founded the Abbey of Lire, or Lyra, in the diocese of Evreux in Normandy, where also he was the founder of the Abbey of Coulanges, in which he died. As was the case with most of the Norman abbeys, a legend is attached to the foundation of Lire, which can be read in the
church history of Normandy {A\'t/s/rm Pia, p. 545). The monk William of Poitiers says that Normandy was an Egypt,
a Thebaid, as regarded monasteries. Duke William of Normandy, so the same writer tells us, never refused his authorization to any one desirous of giving to churches. ' He built
so Ordericus affirms. A com-
many monasteries,'
])Ound of boldness and political scheming, William's followers, soldiers and lawyers, like the ancient Romans, shaven like
the clergy, and good friends of the clergy (at the beginning at least), suj)ported the ('hurch. It appears from Domesday Book, the great authority on the condition of England at the period of the Conquest, that William Fitz Osborne gave to his

" The sea here," said he, " over a of spreads piece
land eight or nine hundred acres in extent, which, tradition tells us, was formerly partly covered with an extensive oak forest, in which the Druids performed their rites. In the centre of the forest was a stone-cased well, in which Merlin, who was a powerful magician, had confined a troublesome water-spirit; and the exact situation of this well was kept a secret, as it was said, that if ever the lid was raised, ruin to the whole country round would follow. The time of the Druids passed away, and all memory of the well was lost, till the time of William the Conqueror, when the Norman knight, Fitz Osborne, who subdued the island and reigned over it as an independent sovereign, gave this tract of land to one of his followers, Robert
Okelandro. This knight, being fond of hunting, determined to clear away the underwood in the forest, and in doing so he discovered the enchanted well, and ordered its cover to be removed that it might be filled up ; some of the oldest inhabitants of the place remonstrated ; but he would be obeyed ; the cover was taken off, and the waters rushed up with such force as to overwhelm the whole district, and to drown the adventurous knight and several of his attendants."]p142 St. Catherine's Down," continued Mr. Merton, " is about nine hundred feet above the level of the sea, and is the highest part of the island."

feet high now in most parts, and that it is gradually
sinking."

Roger thereupon took a brand from the hearth and
promised her as much land as she could encircle whilst the wood was burning. She caused rebuilding.
The house is situated on rather low

still pointed out, and began creeping on her hands and knees ; and in this way she encircled,
before the brand was consumed, a plot of ground twenty-three acres in extent, still known as the Crawels.

p177 Smuggler's retreat / shibeen
Whitwell
One of the small cottages in the lower part of the village, once used as the village post office, during the i8th century was widely known as the “ smugglers’ retreat,” and kept open as a shebeen or “ pop ” shop, where smuggled spirits could be obtained at a cheap rate. Being an unlicensed house, it was closed later by the lord of the manor. A legendary story attaches to the house, connected with the little spring of water, still seen issuing from a recess in the stone wall, close to, but below the ground level of the house. The story is as follows: "At the base of the down above and on its northern aspect, is a farmstead placed in the valley and situated a short distance off the road to the right, leading from St. Lawrence to Whitwell. In the farm yard is the usual pond, on which a brood of ducks—one of these being a fancy breed —were accustomed to swim about and disport themselves. One morning the latter was missing, and early next day it was reported that the missing duck had been found lying in an exhausted condition by the spring near the cottage. From this fact it was positively asserted that the duck had fallen into the well at the farm, and found its way under- ground to St.Lawrence, a mile and a half distant.” From this circumstance, the house obtained its later name as the “ Duck.” The sign of the “ Dog and Duck ” was a common public house sign in the 17th century, and had reference to a sport in vogue at that period, which consisted in seeing ducks hunted in a pond by spaniels. The pleasure arose from watching the bird escape from the dog’s mouth by diving.
The house obtained further notoriety from being the residence of a well-known and successful leader in the local contraband trade, and thither all the local free traders resorted. Captain H maintained intimate relations with the opposite coast, crossing the Channel frequently in his dealings with France and Holland. A story is told which throws a side-light on the social aspects of village life at this period. A vessel—commonly known as a “ Dutch Dogger ”—lay anchored off the shore fronting the village one Sunday morning and attracted the villagers on board, for the purpose of obtaining spirits, or, possibly to aid in removing the cargo. When the minister arrived for the usual service, the clerk said : “ It be no use opening th’ church, ail th’ folks begone aboard the dogger.” The clerk was an old man named
Thos.Paine,living at the “Duck” public-house. His successor, “old John Green,” combined the office of parish clerk with that of schoolmaster. He was widely known for his poetical effusions, and currently credited with maintaining more than a passively sympathetic relation with the contrabandists of the day. There was no church-house, and old John occupied the cottage still standing nearly opposite the church. This served a double purpose as vestry ands choolroom. Here,the rector had to robe himself, putting on a white surplice over his black gown. The arrangements for the religious service were of the primitive type customary in small parish churches at that period. The pulpit and reading desk werec ombined and the clerk sat under. The rector led the singing, and after reciting the first verse of the hymn before the sermon, dis- appeared from view, sitting down on a low stool, to disrobe himself of the white surplice and to reappear in the black gown in which he con- cluded the service.

History Of Isle of Wight, Warner
p180-2
A late amiable naturalilt, speaking of a range of chalk downs, in the upper part of Hampfhire, refembling thofe of the ifland, has the following
obfer-
obfervation : " perhaps I may be fingular in my opinion, and not fo happy as to convey to you the fame idea; but I never contemplate thefe
mountains, without thinking I perceive fome- thing analogous to growth, in their gentle
fwellings, and fmooth fungus like protuberances, their fluted fides, and regular hollows and Hopes, that carry at once the air of vegetative dilatation and expanfion."* The idea is novel and in- genious, and feems to be founded in truth, from
certain appearances of gradual enlargement which the Ifle of Wight hills have exhibited.
It is a well-known facl, that, about half a cen-
tury fince, Shanklin down, which (lands in the
$outh-Eaftern part of the ifland, was not to be difcerned, from St. Catherine's, owing to the intervention of Week down, whofe magnitude and elevation completely fcreened it from the
eye. A gradual, but imperceptible expanfion, however, of Shanklin down, has at length reared
it to a greater bulk, and a greater height, (by at

White's Nat. Hift. Selborne, p. 163.

lead one hundred feet) than that of its formerly
invidious neighbour.
It feems fufficiently clear, that this difference
in the appearance of the two downs muft have arifen rather from the growth of Shanklin, than the finking of Week ; fince the latter, and all the furrounding downs, bear the fame relative proportion to each other they ever did, which could not be the cafe, had any change taken

OUR Pisgah for this stage is St Catherine's Down, once held the highest point of the Island, but now dethroned, like Ben Macdhui, in favour of the Ben Nevis of St Boniface. It appears that in Georgian days Week Down was charged with hiding Shanklin Down from the view of St Catherine's, as is no longer the case, the moral being that one or other of these heights has been raised or depressed, as may well have happened to superstructures upon so slipperyfoundation. Insuchaquestionofmeasure-
ments, at all events, "the self-styled science of the "
so-callednineteenthcentury withitsmoreelaborate observations, gives a surer title to eminence. But St Catherine's is only a few feet lower than the ridge above Ventnor ; and from it, too, a fine prospect may be had, ranging over the Isle of Wight to the heights of the mainland, and across the Channel to the French coast in clear weather.

Divines, who feek for the completion of prophecies, may have a more comfortable and authentic proof, from the re- cent appearance of SkanMm Down, from the Tower of $L
Catherine. Within memory of man, another, called Week Down, interfered fo far as to render the former fcarcely vifi- ble from the Tower; but, at prefent, Shanklin Down appears from that ancient ftructure a hundred feet higher than that of Week: fo that, in this inftance at leaf!:, cc every valley fhall be exalted, and every mountain fhall be made low." remember the infinite fatisfaction I gave to a truly learned and pious Divine on this fubjecl:, by relating to- him, that the later meafures of the height of our boafled Snowdon made
it about a hundred and fifty feet lower than it was in the preceding century.

Stories are told by the inhabitants of the
parish of Chale of the sinking of Week down, which lies about three miles off,in the intermediate way between St.Catherine's and
Shanklin down. They say, that formerly Shanklin down, through the interference of Week down, could only be seen from St.
Catherine's; whereas now it is visible from Chale down; consequently either Week
down must have funk considerably, or
Shanklin down must have increased its altitude. And some of the old people tell you
that this has partly happened within their own
 own remembrance. So wonderfularethe operations of Nature,that it is not for man
to say,“ It cannot be;"but this is an event so far out of her usual course, that I own I could not readily give credit to it.

There are many things in Nature which
not only appear incomprehensible to a careful observer,but which cannot always be
accounted for by the naturalist. Of this we met with an instance here. W e could not help surveying, with a wonder bordering on
astonishment, the sheep that had got over the edges of the craggy precipices, from the
downs they grazed on, and lay in the hollows of the rocks, in order to shelter t h e m
felves from the heat;- we even observed their bleating young ones carefully to de fcend, and reach their dams in safety.-
How ,thus fearless of danger,they leave the plains,andventure on these hazardous de clivities,where the least false step must be
attended with destruction,is,we believe,
beyond the comprehension of the mostfa
gacious naturalist.- So extraordinary did it
appear to us, that nothing but ocular d e
monstration could have convinced us of the truth of it.- The account received from a
peasant,had we not seen their situation, would havemet with but little credit from us.
p207-8
 A phoenomenon of another nature, but not less singular, presented itself to us here.
When wesatout from Knowle a storm seemed to be pending in the horizon ; and by the time we had reached St.Lawrencew eheard
several claps ofthunder. As every incident which tended to produce picturesque effects instantly attracted our attention ,we cast our eyes towards the sea, in order to observe whether any alteration had taken place on
its smooth surface ; when , to our great surprise, we plainly perceived a vessel ,within
eight miles of the shore, labouring under the effects of the storm , and apparently in the greatest distress. And what was extremely striking was, that though the sea where
where the vessel happened to be,rolled (as
it is commonly termed,)mountains high, yet not a breath of that air, which was there fo tempestuous, ruffled the water on the beach beneath us.- An operation of N a
ture that had never before fallen under our
inspection ; and we greatly regretted not having with us some ingenious painter, in
the marine line, to take an exact represents ation of it.
: A light, rendered more bright by the
contrast, had spread itselfround the elec
tric cloud, which was thus venting its rage upon the helpless ship, and rendered the
scene more gloomy. By a glass, we could
perceive that she laboured much under the 'violence of the storm , and every wave came full fraught with danger. For near an
hour did the tempest permit us to behold
its raging at a distance; but at length a brisk wind springing up, it made its way towards us,and we should have shared in
its“ pitiless peltings,”had we not retired
to a neighbouring cottage, where we continued til it had passed on.

godeton livers ??  abbey ?? corruption of Lyra?

Undercliff of Isle of Wight, p264
his inference is strengthened by the fact of the church being one of the six benefices presented by the first Lord of the Island to the Norman abbey of Lyra soon after the conquest took place—^between 1066 and 1071—^probably for the very reason that the benefice was a valuable one.
