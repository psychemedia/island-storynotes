## The Three Little Pigs who went to market

*What is this tale?*

Liverpool Albion - Saturday 09 November 1878

The time honoured story of *How Three Little Pigs went to Market and the Old One Stayed at Home* (G. Waterson, Sons, and Stewart) is a highly tragic, strictly moral, and very amusing story, and is here not only very cleverly illustrated, but is also set to music. The illustrations are comical and far from vulgarity, and the contrast between the highly respectable and elaborately dressed three little pigs who went to market, and the unrecognisable three little pigs who came home again after having quarrelled on the way, is very ludicrous. Young children will certainly enjoy Mr. Doyle's pictures.

> The title, which typifies Victorian punniness, conceals a drastic story in which Mother Pig cooks and eats her children in mistake for pancakes and then expires from the medicine that is prescribed for her. What is also of interest, however, is that this relatively obscure Scottish toybook is illustrated by Charles Doyle, brother of the great *Punch* illustrator, Richard, and father of the creator of Sherlock Holmes.

`[On violence in picture books]` ... An earlier book, published, one would guess, in the 1860s, with the title *The tragic yet strictly moral tale of how three little pigs went to market and the old one stayed at home*, is stated to be 'related in Eggs-hameter, illustrated with cuts from Bacon, and printed in Pigment'. The three little pigs are sent to market by their mother to buy flour, milk and eggs for pancake batter. Alas they start fighting and come home coated in batter from snout to trotter.

And they looked so much like batter,  
Only richer far and fatter  
The old pig, mad as a hatter,  
Put them all in the frying-pan,  
Till all into one they ran.

And then we see their mother, watched by salivating cats, settling down at table to demolish the whole panful, her only expression being greedy anticipation. She eats them all up, and the consequence is a fearful attack of indigestion in the middle of the night.

The doctor gave her a pill,  
Which was certain sure to kill,  
So she died upon the spot,  
And she deserved what she got.

The last picture is a garland of naked piglets, capering gleefully round three mournful little boys clasping their stomachs, the moral being two-fold.

Now boys, you should never fight,  
Nor in quarrelling take delight,  
And never, oh, never at night,  
Roast pork for supper take.

Even more harrowing is a picture book of 1859 which went into several editions. It is based on a rhyme which Thomas Hood used to tell his children — *The headlong career and woful ending of Precocious Piggy*. The tale is very simple; Piggy, dressed as a mid-Victorian swell, goes out to see the world. He takes to driving a gig and drinking. He also goes to a grand ball and (dressed rather more seedily) to the fair.  He also buys a wig. But then his destiny catches up with him.

Where are you going to, you little pig?  
'The Butcher is coming, I've grown so big!'  
The Butcher. Poor pig!  
Are you grown so big?  
Well I think it high time then you hop the twig!

And that is the end of the text. The delicately tinted pictures which illustrate this brief last chapter in Piggy's life show the distraught pig with his hair standing on end kneeling and clasping frenzied trotters, while an implacable butcher in top boots mordantly sharpens his knife. Decorating the text on the page opposite is a composition showing a gutted pig's carcass wreathed in sausages, accompanied by a ham and a pig's head on a plate, and beside it the pig in a shroud haunting his old sty. But what seems especially curious is the introduction by Thomas Hood's daughter. Admitting that she herself used to cry over poor Piggy's tragical fate, she nevertheless concludes with the pious wish that the book will 'bring a merry laugh to the little face of that happy childhood that [my father] loved so well.'

Clever and kindly Tom Hood, not long before he died, gave me a bound copy of that droll yet sympathetic nursery story, written by his distinguished father the poet and wit, entitled 'The Headlong Career and Woeful Ending of Precocious Piggy.' Tom Hood often told me how, as a little boy, he had enjoyed the comical history, when it was related to him by his father, who had written it especially for the amusement of his children, and who were all, more or less, deeply interested in Piggy's adventures. I have drawn many a laugh and many a tear from the little ones to whom I have read the story, and my copy, a gift from the son, who so cleverly illustrated his father's quaint fancy, is much prized by me. Before presenting me with the book, Tom Hood added a pen-and-ink drawing which represents 'Piggy' in evening dress, with crush hat, gloves, and opera-glasses complete. Piggy looks remarkably funny, and one cannot resist laughing heartily at the cleverness of the sketch. Tom Hood also added the following verse to the illustration:

"Where are you going to, you little pig?"  
"To the New Prince of Wales's, dressed out in full fig.'  
"In full fig, young pig?  
A pig in full fig!  
You'll see Marie Wilton, you lucky young pig!"'

‘The Headlong Career and Woeful Ending of Precocious Piggy', by the late Thomas Hood, illustrated by his Son, is an instance of the use of a name, for these few doggrel verses of Hood's are raked up out of the dust-heap of oblivion, and brought out with marvellously dull drawings all about—"Where are you going to, you little pig!—Why, I'm going to have a nice ride in a gig.— In a gig, little pig? what, a pig in a gig? Well, I never yet saw a pig ride in a gig." Of all the drolleries that Aesop has suggested, perhaps this is the feeblest, and it should not have been published by Messrs. Griffith & Farran, even for the smallest of children.

ILLUSTRATED BOOKS FOR THE YOUNG.

THE PUBLICATIONS OF MESSRS. GRIFFITH AND FARRAN.

`‘The Headlong Career and Woeful Ending of Precocious Piggy'. By the late Thomas Hood. Illustrated by his Son.`

WE have selected such as we considered the most suitable for our pages from some very pretty books which the successors of the old firm at the well-known "corner of St. Paul's Church-yard" have sent us, as heralds of the approaching season; and we have placed at the head of our notice a little *brochure* by the late THOMAS HOOD, as a very small mark of the respect due to whatever bears his honoured name. The poet left two children. The simple and touching preface is written by the daughter, now the wife of the Rector of Cossington, and the very clever and amusing illustrations are by the son (Thomas Hood the younger), both already known to the public as the authors of charming tales and poems. The children working out the father's intention in this particular way is a decided novelty in juvenile literature. Mrs. Broderip says, "The following story of 'The Precocious Pig,' was originally related by our dear father when the writer of these lines was a little girl, much inclined to cry over poor Piggy's disaster, and the artist who illustrates it so appropriately was a little fat boy, who chuckled over Piggy's misdeeds with intense enjoyment. Our smiles are now graver and sadder, for, after many years of chance and change, the old familiar words recall only a beloved memory of one who forgot his own cares and sufferings to minister to his children's amusement and pleasure. We feel, however, we are fulfilling what would have been our father's own wish in giving to another generation of little girls and boys the veritable history of Piggy's chequered career. To him children were always welcome; and to us it will be a great pleasure that anything of his can, so many years after his death, bring a merry laugh to the little face of the happy childhood he loved so well."

The poem has no pretension to any portion of the great author's wit or pathos; it is just such a story as a clever, good-natured papa would rhyme for his little ones, with the moral not dragged in, but coming out of the events, and showing how dangerous it is for little pigs, and, by analogy, little people, to abandon too early the shelter of the parental roof. All this has been admirably worked out by the amateur artist. In the very first page Piggy's confidence and Piggy's danger are shown in a way that could do no discredit to our best caricaturist—Leech; every stroke helps the story—every line tells a tale—the falling bird, the butterfly just escaped from the cocoon, yet fluttering on the edge of a watchful spider's web; while on the opposite page Master Piggy, the very perfection of priggishness, and all priggish accessories, is trotting confidently out of the farmyard. All the illustrations are equally "telling;" and did we not know that Mr. Hood has devoted his future to the highest purpose of which this life is capable, we should warn some of the public favourites in this particular walk of Art (for it is Art) that they must look to their laurels.

*The Headlong Career and Woful Ending of Precocious Piggy.* By the late Thomas Hood. Illustrated by his Son. Published by Griffith and Farren.

The story of Precocious Piggy told long ago by the late Thomas Hood to his children, and now illustrated by his son, and edited by his daughter, is an allegory, in which the life of a "fast" youth is typified in the "headlong career" and "woful euding" of a young pig, who starts to see the world and after sundry wild doings finds himself in the hands ef a butcher. The illustrations are clever and humorous. The pig figure as well as the pig fac is preserved throughout.

... We will therefore at once say that we have read and re-read with delight, *The Headlong Career and Woful Ending of Precocious Piggy*, by the late Thomas Hood, illustrated by his son and edited by his daughter, and issued by our old friends at the corner of St. Paul's Churchyard, that world-noted emporium for children's books. In this we first see Piggy at his toilette surrounded by macassar, kalydor, and all other modern appliances. Having dressed himself in the height of dandyism, he sets out to see the world, applying his glass to his eye to assist him therein. Some one whispered "have a taste," and he turns his attention to landscape gardening; but this was slow work for a learned pig, so he takes to driving, sets up a dog-cart, drives a tandem, and does something in the hunting line. Smoking and drinking follow as a matter of course, with soda water and headache in their train. Balls and full-dress evening parties, together with some *fast* life at country fairs and *bal masques*, prepare us for the *denouement* in which Piggy finds his way into pork. Mrs. Broderick tells us that to her father children were always welcome; in return, children will welcome this work of his.

*The Headlong Career and Woful Ending of Precocious Piggy.* By the late Thomas Hood. Illustrated by his Son (London: Griffith and Farran).—This rhymed narration of the adventures of the Precocious Piggy was written by the late Thomas Hood, for the amusement of the inmates of his own nursery; and in the agreeable form which it has now assumed through the labours of the poet's son and of Messrs. Griffith and Farran, we have no doubt that it will contribute to the entertainment of many other nursey *in esse* and *in psosse*. In *Precocious Pig*, his career and untimely fate may be read the stern lesson of life to many an ambitious youth, who, sick of the restraint of parents and home, determines to "see the world," and partake of its delusive enjoyments.

Where are you going to, you little pig?  
"I'm leaving my mother, I'm growing so big!"  
So big, young pig,  
So young, so big!  
What, leaving your mother, you foolish young pig!

Piggy, however, is not to be deterred by good advice, but straightway sallies forth upon his adventures. With an eccentricity of choice, which may perhaps be accounted for by his porcine propensities, he first of all betakes himself to landscape gardening; this fancy, however, is of but short duration, for he very soon sets up a gig, takes to tandem driving and the pleasures of the chase; drinking, dancing, running rigs, and going to masquerades follow in their order, until, alas! unhappy fate! presently comes destiny in the form of the butcher, and puts an end to poor Piggy's career of selfishness and sensuality.

Where are you going to, you little pig?  
"The butcher is coming, I've grown so big!"  
The butcher! Poor pig,  
You have grown so big?  
Well, I think it high time that you hop the twig.

The illustrations, from the pencil of Thomas Hood's son, have really very great merit; for they are intensely humorous, and very suggestive of the moral of the story. The appearance of Piggy himself through the various stages of his career is very admirably preserved; and the minor illustrations, which allegorically typify the dangers and temptations which beset him, from the callow nestling falling into the jaws of the attentive cat, and the spider weaving her snares for the unthinking fly, down to the suggestive group composed of a butcher's keen knife, string of sausages, ham, and carcase of poor Piggy, form a very agreeable commentary upon the whole story. In a few prefatory lines, written by Mrs. Broderip (Hood's daughter), we are told that both she and her brother feel that they are fulfilling what would have been their father's own wish, in giving to another generation of little girls and boys the veritable history of Piggy's chequered career; but whether Hood did or did not intend them to be published, we are quite sure that many little readers will receive it with the warmest welcome.

The Three Little Pigs and the OGRE.

XIX.

THERE were three nice, fat little pigs. The first was small, the second was smaller, and the third was the smallest of all. And these three little pigs thought of going out into the woods to gather acorns, for there were better acorns there than here.

"There's a great ogre who lives over yonder in the woods," says the barn-yard cock.

"And he will eat you up, body and bones," says the speckled hen.

"And there will be an end of you," says the black drake. "If folks only knew what was good for them, they would stay at home and make the best of what they had there," said the old grey goose who laid eggs under the barn, and who had never gone out into the world or had had a peep of it beyond the garden gate.

But no; the little pigs would go out into the world, whether or no; "for," said they, "if we stay at home because folks shake their heads, we will never get the best acorns that are to be had;" and there was more than one barleycorn of truth in that chaff, I can tell you. So out into the woods they went.

They hunted for acorns here and they hunted for acorns there, and by and by whom should the smallest of all the little pigs meet but the great, wicked ogre himself.

"Aha!" says the great, wicked ogre, "it is a nice, plump little pig that I have been wanting for my supper this many a day past. So you may just come along with me now."

"Oh, Master Ogre," squeaked the smallest of the little pigs in the smallest of voices — "oh, Master Ogre, don't eat me! There's a bigger pig back of me, and he will be along presently."

So the ogre let the smallest of the little pigs go, for he would rather have a larger pig if he could get it.

By and by came the second little pig. "Aha!" says the great, wicked ogre, "I have been wanting just such a little pig as you for my supper for this many a day past. So you may just come along with me now."

"Oh, Master Ogre," said the middle-sized pig, in his middle-sized voice, "don't take me for your supper; there's a bigger pig than I am coming along presently. Just wait for him."

Well, the ogre was satisfied to do that; so he waited, and by and by, sure enough, came the largest of the little pigs.

"And now," says the great, wicked ogre, "I will wait no longer, for you are just the pig I want for my supper, and so you may march along with me."

But the largest of the little pigs had his wits about him, I can tell you. "Oh, very well," says he; "if I am the shoe that fits there is no use in hunting for another; only, have you a roasted apple to put in my mouth when I am cooked? for no one ever heard of a little pig brought on the table without a roast apple in its mouth."

No; the ogre had no roasted apple.

Dear, dear! that was a great pity. If he would wait for a little while, the largest of the little pigs would run home and fetch one, and then things would be as they should.

Yes, the ogre was satisfied with that. So off ran the little pig, and the ogre sat down on a stone and waited for him.

Well, he waited and he waited and he waited and he waited, but not a tip of a hair of the little pig did he see that day, as you can guess without my telling you.

And Tommy Pfouce tells me that the great, wicked ogre is not the only one who has gone without either pig or roast apple, because when he could get the one he would not take it without the other.

"And now," says the cock and the speckled hen and the black drake and the old grey goose who laid her eggs under the barn, and had never been out into the world beyond the garden-gate —" and now perhaps you will run out into the world and among ogres no more. Are there not good enough acorns at home?

Perhaps there were; but that was not what the three little pigs thought. "See, now," said the smallest of the three little pigs, "if one is afraid of the water, one will never catch any fish. I, for one, am going out into the woods to get a few acorns."

So out into the woods he went, and there he found all of the acorns that he wanted. But, on his way home, whom should he meet but the great, wicked ogre.

"Aha!" says the ogre, "and is that you?"

Oh, yes, it was nobody else; but had the ogre come across three fellows tramping about in the woods down yonder?

No, the ogre had met nobody in the woods that day. - "Dear, dear," says the smallest little pig, "but that is a pity, for those three fellows were three wicked robbers, and they have just hidden a mealbag full of money in that hole up in the tree yonder."

You can guess how the ogre pricked up his ears at this, and how he stared till his eyes were as big as saucers.

"Just wait," said he to the smallest little pig, "and I will be down again in a minute." So he laid his jacket to one side and up the tree he climbed, for he wanted to find that bag of money, and he meant to have it.

"Do you find the hole?" says the smallest of the little pigs.

Yes; the ogre had found the hole.

"And do you find the money?" says the smallest of the little pigs.

No; the ogre could find no money.

"Then good-bye," says the smallest of the little pigs, and off he trotted home, leaving the ogre to climb down the tree again as he chose.

"And now, at least, you will go out into the woods no more," says the cock, the speckled hen, the black drake, and the grey goose.

Oh, well, there was no telling what the three little pigs would do yet, they would have to wait and see.

One day it was the middle-sized little pig who would go out into the woods, for he also had a mind to taste the acorns there.

So out into the woods the middle-sized little pig went, and there he had all the acorns that he wanted.

But by and by the ogre came along. "Aha!" says he. "Now I have you for sure and certain."

But the middle-sized little pig just stood and looked at a great rock just in front of him, with all of his might and main. "Sh-h-h-h-h-h !" says he, "I am not to be talked to or bothered now!"

Hoity-toity! Here was a pretty song, to be sure! And why was the middle-sized pig not to be talked to? That was what the ogre should like to know.

Oh, the middle-sized little pig was looking at what was going on under the great rock yonder, for he could see the little folk brewing more beer than thirty-seven men could drink.

So! Why, the ogre would like to see that for himself.

"Very well," says the middle-sized little pig, "there is nothing easier than to learn that trick! just taka a handful of leaves from yonder bush and rub them over your eyes, and then shut them tight and count fifty."

Well, the ogre would have a try at that. So he gathered a handful of the leaves and rubbed them over his eyes, just as the middle-sized pig had said.

"And now are you ready?" said the middle-sized little pig.

Yes; the ogre was ready.

"Then shut your eyes and count," said the middle-sized little pig.

So the ogre shut them as tightly as he could and began to count, "One, two, three, four, five," and so on; and while he was counting, why, the little pig was running away home again.

By and by the ogre bawled out "*Fifty!!!*" and opened his eyes, for he was done. Then he saw not more, but less, than he had seen before, for the little pig was not there.

And now it was the largest of the three little pigs who began to talk about going out into the woods to look for acorns.

"You had better stay at home and take things as they come. The crock that goes often to the well gets broken at last;" that was what the cock, the speckled hen, the black drake, and the grey goose said; and they thought themselves very wise to talk as they did.

But no; the little pig wanted to go out into the woods, and into the woods the little pig would go, ogre or no ogre.

After he had eaten all of the acorns that he wanted he began to think of going home again, but just then the ogre came stumping along. "Aha!" says he, "we have met again, have we?"

"Yes," said the largest of the three little pigs, "we have. And I want to say that I could find no roast apple at home, and so I did not come back again."

Yes, yes, that was all very fine; but they should have a settling of old scores now. The largest of the three little pigs might just come along home with the ogre, and to-morrow he should be made into sausages; for there was to be no trickery this time, so there was an end of the matter.

Come, come! the ogre must not be too testy. There was such a thing as having too much pepper in the pudding — that was what the largest of the little pigs said. If it were sausages that the ogre was after, maybe the pig could help him. Over home at the farm yonder was a storehouse filled with more sausages and good things than two men could count. There was a window where the ogre could just squeeze through. Only he must promise to eat what he wanted and to carry nothing away with him.

Well, the ogre promised to eat all he wanted in the storehouse, and then off they went together.

By and by they came to the storehouse at the farm, and there, sure enough, was a window, and it was just large enough for the ogre to squeeze through without a button to spare in the size.

Dear, dear! how the ogre did stuff himself with the sausages and puddings and other good things in the storehouse.

By and by the little pig bawled out as loud as he could, "Have you had enough yet?"

"Hush-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh!" says the ogre, "don't talk so loud, or you'll be rousing the folks and having them about our ears like a hive of bees."

"No," bawled the little pig, louder than before, "but tell me, have you had enough yet?"

"Yes, yes," says the ogre, "I have had almost enough, only be still about it!"

"Very well!" bawled the little pig, as loud as he could, "if you have had enough, and if you have eaten all of the sausages and all of the puddings you can stuff, it is about time that you were going, for here comes the farmer and two of his men to see what all the stir is about."

And, sure enough, the farmer and his men were coming as fast as they could lay foot to the ground.

But when the ogre heard them coming, he felt sure that it was time that he was getting away home again, and so he tried to get out of the same window that he had gotten in a little while before. But he had stuffed himself with so much of the good things that he had swelled like everything, and there he stuck in the storehouse window like a cork in a bottle, and could budge neither one way nor the other; and that was a pretty pickle to be in.

"Oho!" says the farmer, "you were after my sausages and my puddings, were you? Then you will come no more."

And that was so; for when the farmer and his men were done with the ogre he never went into the woods again, for he could not.

As for the three little pigs, they trotted away into the woods every day of their lives, for there was nobody nowadays to stop them from gathering all the acorns that they wanted.
