Whilst searching for mentions of Bridewell, perchance I also stumbled across another location of note, the Cross Bones graveyard in Southwark South London.

In the back streets of south London, a short walk from Shakespeare's Globe, Southwark Cathedral and The Shard, is the site of an old burial ground with an extraordinary history. For centuries it was a paupers' graveyard for the area formerly known as The Mint, one of London's poorest and most violent slums. According to local lore, it was once the final resting place for the Winchester Geese, medieval sex workers licensed by the Bishop of Winchester to work in the brothels of The Liberty of the Clink, which lay outside the law of the City of London.

In 1161 Bishop Henry of Blois was granted the power to license prostitutes and brothels in the liberty by King Henry II.[1] The prostitutes were known as Winchester Geese, and many are buried in Cross Bones,[1] an unconsecrated graveyard. Similarly, to "be bitten by a Winchester goose" meant "to contract a venereal disease",[2] and "goose bumps" was slang for symptoms of venereal diseases.

After the Norman Conquest of 1066, William the Conqueror gave the Isle of Wight to his kinsman William Fitzosbern, who started to build a wooden castle on top of the burh. In 1071 William Fitzosbern died, and his son Roger continued its fortification, planning rebellion against the king. In 1078 the rebellion failed and the castle was controlled by the Crown, and it was there that William the Conqueror arrested his traitorous half-brother Odo in 1082.

Roger de Breteuil, 2nd Earl of Hereford (1056 – after 1087), succeeded in 1071 to the earldom of Hereford and the English estate of his father, William Fitz-Osbern.[1] He is known to history for his role in the Revolt of the Earls[2][3][4]
Roger did not keep on good terms with William the Conqueror, and in 1075, disregarding William's prohibition, Roger married his sister Emma to Ralph Guader, Earl of Norfolk.[1]
Immediately afterwards, the two earls rebelled. Roger, who was to bring his force from the west to join forces with those of the Earl of Norfolk, was held in check at the River Severn by the Worcestershire fyrd, which the English Bishop Wulfstan, Walter de Lacy, and other Normans.[1]
Trial, sentence, and reprieve
On the collapse of their rebellion uprising, Roger was tried for treason[5] before the Great Council, for his role in the Revolt of the Earls. Roger was deprived of his lands and earldom in 1075, and sentenced to perpetual imprisonment.[1] Ralph Breton and Waltheof, 1st Earl of Northumberland were charged as co-conspirators.[5]

Roger was released with other political prisoners when William I died in 1087.

William FitzOsbern (c. 1020 – 22 February 1071), Lord of Breteuil, in Normandy, was a relative and close counsellor of William the Conqueror and one of the great magnates of early Norman England. FitzOsbern was created Earl of Wessex,[1] a title which his son did not inherit. He was created Earl of Hereford in 1067,[a] one of the first peerage titles in the English peerage. He is one of the very few proven companions of William the Conqueror known to have fought at the Battle of Hastings in 1066. His chief residence was Carisbrooke Castle on the Isle of Wight, one of many castles he built in England.

In the summer of 1067 King William returned to Normandy and left his half-brother Bishop Odo of Bayeux and FitzOsbern in charge of England during his absence

Following the Norman conquest, the hide of Southwark was given to William the Conqueror's brother Bishop Odo, but in 1090 he leased it to a local priory, who later passed it on to the Bishop of Winchester (Henry de Blois, brother to the future King Stephen). The nature of the deal meant that the area became a 'Liberty', meaning it was under the jurisdiction of the priory only. It wasn't policed by the King, nor the county officials of Surrey, and most importantly, not the City of London either. So, with the protection and freedom of the church, the outsiders moved into Southwark. And since they were there to make money, they sold the one thing they had that the citizens of London wanted to buy: sex.

 most pragmatic church and political figures recognised that just being sinful wasn't going to stop young people having sex, and reasoned that prostitution was a necessary evil to keep the sin somewhere safely out of the way ("Take away the sewer and you will fill the palace with pollution", as Thomas Aquinas would later put it). And then there was money. Brothels, also known as 'stews', could turn over a lot of money and be charged hefty rents, and this made Southwark one of the most profitable bits of land in the country. The Bishop of Winchester was more than happy to tolerate a bit of sin in exchange for filling his coffers. So the Southwark sex trade boomed. The prostitutes even gained the nickname 'Winchester geese', in honour of their landlord..

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odo_of_Bayeux
Odo of Bayeux (died 1097), Earl of Kent and Bishop of Bayeux, was the uterine[1] half-brother of William the Conqueror, and was, for a time, second in power after the King of England.

Odo was the son of William the Conqueror's mother Herleva and Herluin de Conteville.
Although Odo was an ordained Christian cleric, he is best known as a warrior and statesman, participating in the Council of Lillebonne. He funded ships for the Norman invasion of England and is one of the very few proven companions of William the Conqueror, known to have fought at the Battle of Hastings in 1066. The Bayeux Tapestry, probably commissioned by him to adorn his own cathedral, appears to labour the point that he did not actually fight, that is to say shed blood, at Hastings, but rather encouraged the troops from the rear

In 1072, or a little later, a trial took place [The trial is recorded in various chronicles; see VAN CAENEGEM, R.C., English Lawsuits from William I to Richard I (1066-1199), §5, in the first of two Selden Society publications (abbrev. SS with volume number & year of publication) 106 (published 1990)] between Lanfranc and William's half-brother, Odo (in French texts, Odon or Eudes) a son of William the Conqueror's mother Herleva by Herluin de Conteville. Lanfranc3 was Abbot of Caen, but William I wanted him as archbishop of Canterbury in place of Stigand, the last pre-conquest archbishop. Lanfranc was born in Pavia, a notable centre of legal learning, c1010 where he had had a lay career in both civil and canon law. Before Caen, he had served as prior of the Benedictine house of Bec in Normandy which he had entered in 1042, his scholarly reputation preceding him. He died in 1089.

Odo had been made bishop of Bayeux before the Conquest and after the Battle of Hastings
William made him Earl of Kent and was there when Lanfranc arrived to take up office as
Archbishop. The trial, presided over by bishop Geoffrey of Coutances on the king's behalf, was by the Shire Court at its traditional site, Penenden Heath in mid-Kent . On this occasion the court included both French and English, lay and ecclesiastic, who were acquainted with the preConquest laws and customs; one valued expert was Ægelric, bishop of Chichester for whom William provided a chariot to ensure his attendance: Ægelricus episcopus Cicestra, vir
antiquissimus et legum terre sapientissimus…ad ipsas antiquas legum consuetudines
discutiendas et edocendas… 4
 Lanfranc had complained to the King that Odo and others had
despoiled the Church of Christ at Canterbury of its lands, terras proprias, depriving it of the
secular jurisdiction it had customarily enjoyed. The lands were extensive and are listed,5
 in
Kent and seven other counties, north and south of the Thames. The archbishop's claim is
described as a "deraignment," that is, an assertion or accusation of spoliation – what would later
be thought of as dissesin, and on a grand scale. The parties deliberated for three days: omnes
consederunt, et quoniam multa placita de diraciocinacionibus terrarum et verba de
consuetudinibus legum inter archiepiscopum et Odonem Bajocensem episcopum, qui multas
terras de archiepiscopatu sibi usurpaverat. The names are given of those who had seized lands
and associated customary rights claimed by the church (using their Old English names). After hearing the claim and the evidence, restitution was ordered.

## A Tale of Bishop Odo

Many of you will be familiar from school history lessons at least of the Bayeux Tapestry, the nine hundred year old tapestry that tells the tale among other things of William of Normandy, which is to say, William the Conqueror's, defeat of Harold Godwinson, King of England, at the Battle of Hastings in 1066.

One of the few people mentioned by name in the tapestry is Bishop Odo of Bayeux. Some say Odo commissioned the tapestry, others that it was presented to him. But whilst the story of how the tapestry came to be is disputed, what is not disputed is that Odo was the half-brother of William, by way of Herleva, who was natural mother to both.

The Isle of Wight: its history, topography and antiquities: with notes upon its principal seats, churches, manoral houses, legendary and poetical associations, geology and picturesque localities ...
by Adams, W. H. Davenport (William Henry Davenport), 1828-1891

Publication date 1884

pp.17-8

On one occasion only did the Conqueror visit his island fortress, and that was in an hour of peril which strongly brought out the dominant qualities of his kingly mind. His half-brother, Odo, bishop of Bayeux, half warrior, half priest, who had received from him the earldom of Kent, and fat estates and manifold honours, collected during the Conqueror's absence in Normandy a large and powerful following in the Isle of Wight, with the view of crossing into Italy and intriguing for the Popedom.

The king, apprised of his brother's ambitious design, suddenly returned, and summoned to Carisbrooke Castle his knights and menat-arms, and other vassals.

They met in the Royal Hall (*regalis aula*), by the shifting lights of a hundred torches, which wavered and flickered merrily enough upon the glittering armour of the knightly crowd. William sat awhile in stern silence upon the dais; but when the murmur of voices was hushed, he recounted, one by one, the offences which Odo had done against him.

"Excellent peers," he cried, if we may believe the old historian, "I beseech you hearken to my words, and give me your counsel. At my sailing into Normandy I commended England to the government of Odo, my brother, the bishop. In Normandy my foreign foes have risen up against me — yea, and inward friends, I may say, have invaded me; for Robert my son, and other young lords whom I have brought up, and given arms, have rebelled, unto whom my false clients and other bordering enemies have given their assistance. But they have not prospered — God (whose servant I am) ever defending me; neither have they gotten anything of mine besides iron in their wounds. They of Anjou prepared against me; whom, with the fear only of war, I have pacified. These businesses, you know, have drawn me into Normandy, where I have stayed long, and employed my painful endeavours on public behoofs. But, in the meantime, my brother hath greatly oppressed England, spoiling the Church of lands and rents; hath made it naked of ornaments given by our predecessors; and hath seduced my knights, with purpose to train them over the Alps, who ought to defend the land against the invasion of the Danes, Irish, and other enemies over strong for me: but my greatest dolour is for the Church of God, which he hath afflicted, and unto which the Christian kings that reigned before me have given many gifts, and with their loves honoured; for which now (as we believe) they rest, rejoicing with a happy retribution in a pleasant state. But my brother, to whom I committed the whole kingdom, violently plucketh away their goods, cruelly grindeth the poor, and with a vain hope stealeth away my knights from me, and by oppression hath exasperated the whole land with unjust taxations. Consider thereof, most noble lords, and give me, I pray you, your advice what is herein to be done" (*Speed*, book ix.).

But Odo was a prelate, and sacred, a noble wealthy and powerful, and not over slow in his punishment of an enemy. No wonder, therefore, that out of all that knightly train not one dared raise his voice against him.

"Seize him!" shouted the Conqueror, as if resolved to construe their silence into an acknowledgment of his brother's offences — "seize him, and let him be closely guarded."

But not a knight laid his finger upon the prince of the Church. All stood mute and aghast at the wrath of the king, who, with instant decision, sprang from his seat, strode through his astonished followers, and grasped his brother's robes.

Whereupon Odo exclaimed, "I am a priest and a servant of the Lord. None but the Pope has the right to judge me."

The monarch, prepared for the crafty excuse, replied, "I do not punish thee as a priest, but as my own vassal, and as a noble whom I myself have made."

And Odo, surrounded by armed men, was borne from his sovereign's presence, and in due time despatched across the seas, to wear out many years in a Norman fortress.

Great spoil fell into William's hands. "Heaps of yellow metal did move admiration in the beholders; and many of his bags were taken up out of the bottom of a river [the Medina?], where they were hidden, full of gold ground into powder" (*Speed*).

https://www.southwarknews.co.uk/history/the-bishops-brothels/ For one part of Southwark in particular, with street names like Sluts' Hole, Cuckold Court, Codpiece Lane and Whores' Nest, this was quite an undertaking and perhaps why in 1107, the Abbot leased the Liberty's 70 acres of Bankside real estate to the Bishop Gifford of Winchester for eight pounds a year.

Bishop of Winchester - In 1161 he produced a decree especially for the brothels of Bankside, which shows how notorious they were, comparable to Amsterdam's modern day equivalent.

The Ordinances Touching the Government of the Stewholders in Southwark Under the Direction of the Bishop of Winchester set out 39 rules for running the eighteen houses of ill repute and gave Southwark's brothels what amounted to royal recognition, a special status and protection they would enjoy for the next four centuries.

See First Part of K. Hen. VII. Act i. sc. iii. The houses on the Bankside are mentioned in the reign of Hen. II., in 1162, being then eighteen in number. Strict rules were issued for their regulation, the Clink prison being originally provided to receive transgressing 'stew -holders.' The title of the rules established by the Act 8 Hen. II. runs, ' Ordinances touching the government of the Stewholders in Southwark under the direction of the Bishop of Winchester.' As further indicating their ecclesiastical patronage, one of the houses bore the sign 'The Cardinal's Hat.' They were not finally abolished till 1546, under Hen. VIII.; until which time the profits accruing from their licences were no doubt in the hands of the Bishop of Winchester.

From the arrangement in Stow's "Survey" it appears that the Bordello, or Stews, "a place so called of certaine Stew-houses priviledged there," were situated between the bear- gardens and the Clinke, "a Gaole or Prison for the Trespassers in those parts; namely, in olde time for such as should brabble, fray, or breake the peace on the said bauke, or in the Brothell houses." As remotely as 1102 (8 Henry I.) some parliamentary ordinances "touching the Government of the Stewholders in Southwark, under the discretion of the lord Bishop of Winchester," were issued, the purpose of which seems to have been to restore the state of things there, "accordinge to the ovlde customes that hath been vsed and accustomed tyme out of mynde." `[The women were forbidden the rites of the Church, and denied Chrisian burial if not reconciled before their decease; but a plot of unconsecrated ground, call the Single Women's Churchyard, was allotted for the interment "far from the Church".]` The regulations were numerous; no single woman was to be kept against her will, and all were "to be A'voyded out of the Lordship" on holidays.

Stow acquaints us that the allowed houses had signs painted on thieir front walls towards the Thames, among which were the Boar's Head, the Cross Keys and the Cardinal's Hat.

The Survey Of London
by John Stow

Published 1842

p151-

Now, to return to the west bank, there be two bear gardens, the old and new places, wherein be kept bears, bulls, and other beasts, to be baited; as also mastiffs in several kennels, nourished to bait them. These bears and other beasts are there baited in plots of ground, scaffolded about for the beholders to stand safe.

Next on this bank was sometime the Bordello, or Stewes, a place so called of certain stew-houses privileged there, for the repair of incontinent men to the like women; of the which privilege I have read thus:

In a parliament holden at Westminster, the 8th of Henry IX, it was ordained by the commons, and confirmed by the king and lords, that divers constitutions for ever should be kept within that lordship or franchise, according to the old customs that had been there used time out of mind: amongst the which these following were some, viz.

"That no stew-holder or his wife should let or stay any single woman, to go and come freely at all times when they listed.  
"No stew-holder to keep any woman to board, but she to board abroad at her pleasure.  
"To take no more for the woman's chamber in the week, than fourteen pence.  
"Not to keep open his doors upon the holidays.  
"Not to keep any single woman in his house on the holidays, but the bailiff to see them voided out of the lordship.  
"No single woman to be kept against her will that would leave her sin.  
"No stew-holder to receive any woman of religion, or any man's wife.  
"No single woman to take money to lie with any man, but she lie with him all night till the morrow.  
"No man to be drawn or enticed into any stew-house.  
"The constables, bailiff, and others, every week to search every stew-house.  
"No stew-holder to keep any woman that hath the perilous infirmity of burning, not to sell bread, ale, flesh, fish, wood, coal, or any victuals, etc."

These and many more orders were to be observed upon great pain and punishment. I have also seen divers patents of confirmation, namely, one dated 1345, the 19th of Edward III. `["Li. St. Mary Eborum. English people disdayned to be baudes. Froes of Flaunders were women for that purpose." — Stow.` Also I find, that in the 4th of Richard II., these stew-houses belonging to William Walworth, then mayor of London, were farmed by Frees of Flanders, and spoiled by Walter Tyler, and other rebels of Kent: notwithstanding, I find that ordinances for the same place and houses were again confirmed in the reign of Henry VI., to be continued as before. Also, Robert Fabian writeth, that in the year 1506, the 21st of Henry VII., the said stew-houses in Southwarke were for a season inhibited, and the doors closed up, but it was not long (saith he) ere the houses there were set open again, so many as were permitted, for (as it was said) whereas before were eighteen houses, from thenceforth were appointed to be used but twelve only. These allowed stew-houses had signs on their fronts, towards the Thames, not hanged out, but painted on the walls, as a Roar's head, the Cross keys, the Gun, the Castle, the Crane, the Cardinal's hat, the Bell, the Swan, etc. I have heard of ancient men, of good credit, report, that these single women were forbidden the rites of the church, so long as they continued that sinful life, and were excluded from Christian burial, if they were not reconciled before their death. And therefore there was a plot of ground called the Single Woman's church-yard, appointed for them far from the parish church.

In the year of Christ 1546, the 37th of Henry VIII., this row of stews in Southwarke was put down by the king's commandment, which. was proclaimed by sound of trumpet, no more to be privileged, and used as a common brothel, but the inhabitants of the same to keep good and honest rule as in other places of this realm, etc.

Then next is the Clinke, `[It is now but little used; and it is understood that the persons who are at present confined therein for debt will, under a late act of parliament, shortly he removed to the Queen's Bench.]` a gaol or prison for the trespassers in those parts; namely, in old time, for such as should brabble, frey, or break the peace on the said bank, or in the brothel houses, they were by the inhabitants thereabout apprehended and committed to this gaol, where they were straitly imprisoned.

Next is the bishop of Winchester's house, or lodging, when he cometh to this city; which house was first built by William Gifford, bishop of Winchester, about the year 1107, the 7th of Henry I., upon a plot of ground pertaining to the prior of Bermondsey, as appeareth by a writ directed unto the barons of the Exchequer, in the year 1366, the 41st of Edward III. (the bishop's see being void), for eight pounds, due to the monks of Bermondsey for the bishop of Winchester's lodging in South- wark. This is a very fair house, well repaired, and hath a large wharf and landing-place, called the bishop of Winchester's stairs.

Adjoining to this, on the south side the roof, is the bishop of Rochester's inn or lodging, by whom first erected I do not now remember me to have read; but well I wot the same of long time hath not been frequented by any bishop, and lieth ruinous for any lack of reparations. The abbot of Maverley had a house there.

East from the bishop of Winchester's house, directly over against it, standeth a fair church called St. Mary over the Rie, or Overie, that is over the water. This church, or some other in place thereof, was of old time, long before the Conquest, a house of sisters, founded by a maiden named Mary; unto the which house and sisters she left (as was left to her by her parents) the oversight and profits of a cross ferry, or traverse ferry over the Thames, there kept before that any bridge was built. This house of sisters was after by Swithen, a noble lady, converted into a college of priests, who in place of the ferry built a bridge of timber, and from time to time kept the same in good reparations, but lastly the same bridge was built of stone; and then in the year 1106 was this church again founded for canons regulars by William Pont de la Arche and William Dauncy, knights, Normans.

William Gifford, bishop of Winchester, was a good benefactor also, for he, as some have noted, built the body of that church, in the year 1106, the 7th of Henry I.
The canons first entered the said church then; Algodus was the first prior.

Odo  - first chief justice http://www.duhaime.org/LawMuseum/LawArticle-1122/Odo-of-Bayeux-First-Chief-Justice-of-England-1038-1096.aspx
 Few had legal training and the trust of William but his half-brother, the bishop Odo, who was named as first chief justice of the new realm.

 Odo was also made a powerful land baron, granted the lucrative earldom of Kent, and he held the alternate title of the Earl of Kent.

Odo's responsibilities were not just as a final appellate court. The chief justice was also first officer in charge of finances and public order. He also stood as William's agent when, as he often did, William left England to return to Normandy. The English historian Henry of Huntingdon, writing in the first century after the conquest, referred to Odo as: Episcopus Baiocensis, Justiciarus et Princeps totius Angliae.

Translation: Odo, Bishop of Bayeux, Justiciar and Chief of all England.
There was another reported case at the time, involving Odo but not as judge, as defendant. This time, Odo was accused of taking Church land. The trial was presided over by Geoffrey of Counstance. The Court upheld the charge against the Chief Justice.
The legacy of Odo was rich by any standard but not for this chief justice.
As he suppressed rebellions, he kept much of the land of the rebels.

Soon, his land holdings were immense and he held a personal fortune. As any good, medieval and rich bishop might be inclined to do, he began to aspire to the papacy. Houses and lands were bought up in Italy and Rome and he put together a fleet and was poised to sail to Rome to claim the Holy See when a small detail caught up to him. He had forgotten to run this by William who heard of it in the nick of time and rushed to the port of departure. The King ordered his soldiers to arrest Odo but they cowered as the chief justice was decked in ecclesiastic robes. William himself stepped forward and arrested Odo uttering the famous words:

"God forbid that I should touch the Bishop of Bayeux, but I make the Earl of Kent my prisoner."

Odo was sent back to France where he was imprisoned at the Castle of Rouen for five years, until William died in September of 1087.

Instantly, Odo threw himself into the intrigue of Royal succession and he backed the claim of Rufus. In 1087, Odo was returned to his former positions including Chief Justiciar but he was bitten by the bug of political conspiracy. Soon, he was in league with Geoffrey of Counstance and others in a proposed coup d'etat in favour of pretender to the throne Robert of Normandy. But Rufus recognized Odo as the ringleader and attacked him immediately. Odo's troops were overwhelmed and Odo ran into the castle of Paverny. After seven weeks, Odo surrendered and was once again, banished from England.

He retreated to Bayeux under the protection of Robert. In 1095, he was present at the famous Council of Clermont at which Pope Urban II proclaimed the First Crusade.
Odo began the pilgrimage to the Holy Land where Robert eventually died during the siege of Antioch. Odo had decided to stop over at Palermo to visit his old friend, Roger, the Count of Sicily. There, he died in 1096 or 1097.

Bishop Odo  (carisbrooke gold) https://erenow.net/postclassical/1066thehiddenhistoryinthebayeuxtapestry/17.php [1066: the hidden history in the Bayeux Tapestry
by Bridgeford, Andrew] The Downfall of Bishop Odo

The king was in Normandy when he learnt of Odo's plans. [1082] He raced back across the Channel and arrested Odo without warning on the Isle of Wight. The bishop's underlings were compelled to reveal the whereabouts of his treasure. Hidden in various secret places, wrote William of Malmesbury in about 1125, was such a quantity of gold that it 'surpassed anything that our age could imagine'. Many sacks of beaten gold were hauled out of rivers, where they had been secretly stashed away; and apparently those who already knew the whereabouts of Odo's secret hoards were able to make off with much of the treasure before the king's men arrived.

Odo protested that he was a clerk and a priest of God and that William had no right to condemn a bishop without papal authority. To this William replied, on the advice of Archbishop Lanfranc, that he was arresting not the Bishop of Bayeux but the Earl of Kent, subtly turning Odo's hitherto successful duality firmly against him. Wace, writing in the second half of the twelfth century, tells us that at times Odo had even coveted the throne of England, making discreet enquiries as to whether there was any precedent for a bishop to succeed to a kingdom.10 Whatever the truth in this, William now conceived an utter hatred for his half-brother. The arrogant and over-mighty Odo languished as William's prisoner in the dungeon of Rouen for the next four years.

William Of Malmesburys Chronicle Of The Kings Of England
by Giles, J. A.

Published 1847

p.307-8

.... William's brothers, by this match, were Robert, a man of heavy, sluggish disposition, whom he made earl of Moreton; and Odo, whom, while he was earl, he made bishop of Bayeux; and when king, created him earl of Kent. Being of quicker talents than the other, he was governor of all England, under the king, after the death of William Fitz-Osbeme. He had wonderful skill in accumulating treasure; possessed extreme craft in dissembling: so that, though absent, yet, stuffing the scrips of the pilgrims with letters and money, he had nearly purchased the Roman papacy from the citizens. But when, through the rumour of his intended journey, soldiers eagerly flocked to him from all parts of the kingdom, the king, taking offence, threw him into confinement; saying, that he did not seize the bishop of Bayeux, but the earl of Kent. His partisans being intimidated by threats, discovered such quantities of gold, that the heap of precious metal would surpass the belief of the present age; and, at last, many sackfuls of wrought gold were also taken out of the rivers, which he had secretly buried in certain places. When released, at the death of his brother, he joined Robert's party, as he was averse to his nephew William: but then too matters turning out unfavourably, he was banished England, and went over to his nephew and his bishopric in Normandy. Afterwards, proceeding with him on his enterprize to Jerusalem, he died at Antioch while it was besieged by the Christians.

Of William the Second. [a.d. 1087 — 1100.]

William then, the son of William, was born in Normandy many years before his father came to England; and being educated with extreme care by his parents, as he had naturally an ambitious mind, he at length reached the summit of dignity. He would no doubt have been a prince incomparable in our time, had not his father's greatness eclipsed him; and had not the fates cut short his years too early for his maturer age to correct errors, contracted by the licentiousness of power, and the impetuosity of youth. When childhood was passed, he spent the period of youth in military occupations; in riding, throwing the dart, contending with his elders in obedience, with those of his own age in action: and he esteemed it injurious to his reputation, if he was not the foremost to take arms in military commotions; unless he was the first to challenge the adversary, or when challenged, to overcome him. To his father he was ever dutiful; always exerting himself in his sight in battle, ever at his side in peace. His hopes gradually expanding, he already aspired after the succession, especially on the rejection of his elder brother, while the tender age of the younger gave him no uneasiness. Thus, adopted os his successor by his father during his last illness, he set out to take possession of the kingdom ere the king had breathed his last: where being gladly received by the people, and obtaining the keys of the treasury, he by these means subjected all England to his will. Archbishop Lanfranc, the grand mover of every thing, had educated him, and made him a knight, `[At this period the custom of receiving a knighthood from the hands of bishops or abbats yet obtained. There is a law of Henry I., prohibiting abbats from making knights. Hardy.]` and now he favoured his pretensions to the throne; by his authority and assistance William was crowned on the day of the saints Cosmos and Damian, `[The 27th of September.]` and passed the remainder of the winter quietly and with general favour.

At the expiration of this period, in the beginning of spring, his first contention was with his uncle, Odo, bishop of Bayeux. For when Odo, on his release from confinement, as I have related, had firmly established his nephew, Robert, in the duchy of Normandy, he came to England, and received from the king the earldom of Kent. But when he saw every thing in the kingdom managed, not at his own pleasure, as formerly, for the administration of public affairs was now committed to William, bishop of Durham, he was moved with envy, and having revolted from the king, he tainted many others by insinuating, that the kingdom belonged to Robert, who was of gentler disposition, and whose youthful follies had been corrected by many adversities; that William, delicately brought up, and overbearing from that ferocity of mind which was manifest in his countenance, would dare every thing, in defiance of right and equity: that it must soon come to pass, that they would lose the honours they had already obtained with so much difficulty; that nothing was gained by the father's death, if those whom he had cast into prison, were to be killed by the son. To this effect he used, at first, secretly to mutter, together with Roger Mont- gomery, Gosfrith, bishop of Coutances, with his nephew Robert earl of Northumberland, and others; afterwards they were more open in their clamours, repeating and disseminating them by letters and by emissaries. Moreover, even William, bishop of Durham, the confidential minister of the king, had join^ in their treachery. This was matter of great concern to William, it is said; because, together with the breach of friendship, he was disappointed of the resources of the distant provinces. Odo now carried off booty of every kind to Rochester, plundering the king's revenues in Kent, and especially the lands of the archbishop; breathing eternal hatred against him, because, he said, it was by his advice that his brother had cast him into chains. Nor was this assertion false: for when William the elder formerly complained to Lanfranc, that he was deserted by his brother: "Seize, and cast him into chains," Said he. "What!' replied the king, "he is a clergyman!" Then the archbishop with playful archness, as Persius says, balancing the objection with nice antithesis," `[Persius Sat i. 85]` rejoined, "you will not seize the bishop of Bayeux, but confine the earl of Kent"

Nelson's Handbook to the Isle of Wight: Its History, Topography, and ...
by William Henry Davenport Adams

Publication date 1873

pp. 19-21

A.D. 1065

On one occasion only did the Conqueror visit his island-fortress, and that was in an hour of peril which vividly brought out the manly qualities of his kingly mind. His half-brother, Odo, bishop of Bayeux, half-warrior half-priest, who had received from King William the province of Kent, and fat estates and manifold honours, collected during the Conqueror's absence in Normandy a large and powerful following in the Isle of Wight, with the view of going forth into Italy and intriguing for the Popedom.

The king, apprised of his brother's ambitious design, suddenly returned, and summoned to Oarisbrooke Castle his knights and men-at-arms, and other vassals.

They met in the Royal Hall (*regalis aula*), by the shifting lights of a hundred torches, which wavered and flickered merrily enough upon the glittering armour of the knightly throng. William, with moody brow and angry eye, sate in stern silence upon the dais; and when the murmur of voices was hushed, he recounted, one by one, the oflFences which Odo had done against him:—

"Excellent peers," he cried, if we may believe the old historian, "I beseech you hearken to my words, and give me your counsel. At my sailing into Normandy I commended England to the government of Odo, my brother, the bishop. In Normandy my foreign foes have risen up against me, — yea, and inward friends, I may say, have invaded me; for Robert my son, and other young lords whom I have brought up, and given arms, have rebelled, unto whom my false clients, and other bordering enemies, have given their assistance. But they have not prospered, God (whose servant I am) even defending me; neither have they gotten anything of mine besides iron in their wounds. They of Anjou prepared against me whom, with the fear only of war, I have pacified. These businesses, you know, have drawn me into Normandy, where I have stayed long, and employed my painful endeavours on public behoofs. But, in the meantime, my brother hath greatly oppressed England, spoiling the Church of lands and rents; hath made it naked of ornaments given by our predecessors, and hath seduced my knights, with purpose to train them over the Alps, who ought to defend the land against the invasion of the Danes, Irish, and other enemies overstrong for me; but my greatest dolour is for the Church of God, which he hath afflicted, and unto which the Christian kings that reigned before me have given many gifts, and with their loves honoured; for which now (as we believe), they rest, rejoicing with a happy retribution in a pleasant state. But my brother, to whom I committed the whole kingdom, violently plucketh away their goods, cruelly grindeth the poor, and with a vain hope stealeth away my knights from me, and by oppression hath exasperated the whole land with unjust taxations. Consider thereof, most noble lords, and give me (I pray you) your advice what is herein to be done." — *Speed, Book ix.*

But Odo was a prelate, and sacred — a noble wealthy and powerful, and not over-slow in his punishment of an enemy. What marvel, then, that out of all that knightly gathering not one dared raise his voice against him?

"Seize him!" shouted the Conqueror, as if resolved to construe their silence into an acknowledgment of his brother's offences, — "seize him, and let him be closely guarded."

But not a knight laid his finger upon the prince of the Church. All stood mute and aghast at the king's wrath. With instant decision, he sprang from his seat, strode through his astonished followers, and grasped his brother's robes.

Whereupon Odo exclaimed, "I am a priest and a servant of the Lord! None but the Pope has the right to judge me."

The monarch, prepared for the crafty excuse, replied, "I do not punish thee as a priest, but as my own vassal, and a noble whom I myself have made."

And Odo was surrounded by armed men, and borne from his sovereign's presence; and in due time he was despatched across the seas to wear out many years in a Norman fortress.

Great spoil fell into William's hands. "Heaps of yellow metal did move admiration in the beholders, and many of his bags were taken up out of the bottom of a river (the Medina?), where they were hidden, full of gold ground into powder." — *Speed*.

TO DO

Ch. III. Norman oppression.— The English secretly form conspiracies. — Large bodies emigrate to Constantinople and join the emperor's hody-guard.— Attempt of Eustace, count of Boulogne, to surprise Dover Castle. Meanwhile the English were oppressed by the insolence of the :N^rmans, and subjected to grievous outrages by the haughty governors who disregarded the king's injunctions. The° chiefs of inferior rank, who had the custody of the castles, treated the natives, both gentle and simple, with the utmost scorn, and levied on them most unjust exactions. Bishop Odo himself, and William Fitz-Osbern, the king's lieutenants, puffed up with pride, gave no heed to the reasonable complaints of his English subjects and disdained to weigh them in the balance of equity. They screened their men-at-arms who most outrageously robbed the people and ravished the women, and those only incurred their wrath who were driven by these grievous affronts to be loud in their remonstrances. The English deeply lamented the loss of their freedom, and took secret counsel how they might best shake off a yoke so insupportable, and to which they were so little accustomed. They accordingly sent a message to Sweyn,- king of Denmark, entreating him to take measures for recovering the crown of England, which his ancestors Sweyn and Canute had formerly won by their victorious arms. Some went into voluntary exile, either to free themselves from the domination of their Norman masters, or for the purpose of obtaining foreign aid to renew the contest with their conquerors. Some, the very flower of the English youth, made their way to distant regions, and served valiantly in the armies of Alexius, emperor of Constantinople,^ a prince of great sagacity and ...

p49
What shall I say of Odo, bishop of Baieux, who was earl palatine, and generally dreaded by the English people, issuing his orders everywhere like a second king. He had the command over all the earls and barons of the realm, and with the treasures collected from ancient times, was in possession of Kent, the former kingdom of Ethelbert, son of Ermenric, Eadbald, Egbert, and his brother Lothaire, and where the first English kings were converted to the faith of Christ by the disciples of Pope Gregory, and obtained the crown of eternal life by their obedience to the divine law. The character of this prelate, if I am not deceived, was a compound of vices and virtues; but he was more occupied with worldly affairs than in the exercise oi spiritual graces. The monasteries of the saints make great complaints of the injuries they received at the hands of Odo, who, with violence and injustice, robbed them of the funds with which the English had piously endowed them in ancient times. `[ Lanfranc, with great firmness, claimed before the inquest of the county .resided over by Geoifry, bishop of Coutances, certain estates of which Odo had deprived the see of Canterbury, and obtained their restoration]`

p372
Cii. VIII. Odo, bishop of Bajeux, takes measures for succeeding Hildebrand in the papacy — He is arrested his King William for abusing his authority, and imprisoned at Rouen.

While the storms which we have just described were agitating the world, certain sorcerers at Rome applied their art to discover who would succeed Hildebrand in the papacy,`[ Urban II., March 12, 1088— July 29, 1099.]` and found that after the death of Gregory `[Gregory VI L, April 22, 1073— May 25, 1085.

The last words of this pope, pronounced at the point of death, are well known: "I have loved justice and hated iniquity; therefore I die in exile."

But the magnificent reply of one of the PreLates who attended him is not so commonly known: "You, my lord, cannot die in exile, for as the vicar of Christ and his apostles, you have received the nations for your inheritance, and the utmost parts of the earth for your possession."]`, a prelate of the name of Odo Would be pope of Rome.

When Odo, bishop of Bayeux, who, under his brother King William, had the chief rule over the Normans and English, heard this, he made light of the authority and wealth which the government of a western kingdom conferred, and aspired to the papal power which would give him wider sway and raise him above all earthly princes. He therefore despatched his emissaries to Rome, where he purchased a palace, and conciliating the senators by magnificent gifts, he ornamented his residence with lavish expense and costly superfluities.

Attaching to his person Hugh, earl of Chester, and a goodly company of distinguished knights, he engaged them to attend him to Italy, by prodigal promises added to his entreaties. The Normans are ever given to change and desirous of visiting foreign lands, and they therefore readily joined themselves to the aspiring prelate whose ambition was not satisfied by the dominion of England and Normandy. In consequence they resolved on abandoning the vast estates which they possessed in the west of Europe, and pledged themselves to attend the bishop beyond the Po. `[M. Le Prevost remarks that, notwithstanding the vanity and ambition of Odo were equal to his avarice, there is difficulty in believing that the bishop ever seriously contemplated obtaining the papacy, or even fixing his residence near a pontiff of such rigid morals and resolute character as Gregory VII., in the midst also of all the difficulties and dangers which arose out of the contest between the chief of the church and the emperor, seconded by the anti-pope Guibert, which was then at its highest pitch of violence. Our brother editor conjectures that Odo, ill-informed of the obstacles which these two personages raised to free communication with the legitimate pope, only proposed to exhibit his pomp at the council convoked for the autumn of the following year. It is, however, scarcely to be supposed that the bishop of Bayeux would have taken the steps related by our author for a merely temporary purpose. History is not without an example of English wealth spent for a more chimerical purpose in the case of Richard's (earl of Cornwall) ambition for the empty title of king of the Romans, Wolsey, too, whose character in many respects was singularly identical with that of Odo, made pretensions to the papacy. On the whole we are led to conclude that the bishop's real intentions had transpired, and that our historian's statements are at least founded on what he thought credible authority. The accurate Mahueshury ...ys that Odo "by stuffing the scrips of the pilgrims wUh letters^and money had nearly purchased the Roman papacy from the citizens. — B. iii. p. 307, Bohn's Antiq. Lib.]`

The wise king William speedily heard of these preparations but the scheme did not meet his approbation, for he considered that it was fraught with injury to his own kingdom as well as to others. He therefore lost no time m crossing the sea, and at the isle of Wight presented himself unexpectedly to bishop Odo, when he was on the point of sailing for Normandy with a pompous retinue. Having assembled the great nobles of the realm in his royal court, the king thus addressed them: —

"Illustrious lords, listen attentively to what I shall say, and give me, I pray you, salutary counsel. Before I went over to Normandy, I entrusted the government ot England to my brother the bishop of Bayeux. There were inNormandy many who revolted against my authority, and, if I may so say, both friends and foes set themselves against me. Even my own son Robert, and the young nobles whom I had brought up and invested with the ensigns of knighthood rebelled against me, while some traitorous vassals and my border foes eagerly joined the ranks of the malcontents. But by God's help, whose servant I am, they failed of success, and got nothing from me but the sword which pierced them with wounds By the terror of my arms I restrained the people of Anjou, who were leagued for war against me and I also curbed the rebellious inhabitants of Maine. Thus occupied, I found myself embarrassed by affairs beyond sea, and was long detained labouring earnestly for the public good.

Meanwhile, my brother grievously oppressed the English robbing the churches of their lands and revenues, and stripping them of the ornaments with which our forefathers enriched them; while he seduced my knights, whose duty it was to defend England against the Danes- and Irish, and other enemies who threatened hostilities, and has made preparations, in contempt of me, for transporting them into foreign regions beyond the Alps. My heart is overwhelmed with grief, especially on account of the injury he has done to the churches of God. The Christian kings who reigned before me were devoted to the church, on which they heaped honours and gifts of every kind, and hence, as we believe, they now repose in the seats of bliss, rejoicing in their glorious rewards. Ethelbert, Edwin and St. Oswald, Ethelwulfa and Alfred, Edward the elder and Edgar, with Edward my cousin and most dear lord, richly endowed our holy church, which is the spouse of Christ. And now, my brother, to whom I entrusted the care of my entire kingdom, has laid violent hands on her substance, has cruelly oppressed the poor, has seduced my knights on frivolous pretences, and has spread disorder through the whole of England by his unjust exactions. Consider then prudently what is to be done, and let me know, I pray you, what you advise."

All the council, however, being restrained by fear of the powerful prelate, and hesitating to make a decision against him, the stout-hearted king said: "A dangerous ambition must always be curbed, and an individual must not be spared, for favour or aifection, to the public detriment. Let this man therefore who disturbs the state be arrested, and closely confined, that he may not do further mischief."

No one however daring to lay hands on a bishop, the king was the first to seize him, upon which Odo cried out, "I am a clerk, and the Lord's minister; it is not lawful to condemn a bishop without the judgment of the pope." To which the prudent king replied: "I do not condemn a clerk or a bishop, but I arrest an earl I have myself created `[William had created his brother earl of Kent.]`, and to whom, as my vicegerent, I entrusted the government of my realm, it being my will that he should render an account of the stewardship I have committed to him."

In this manner the royal authority was exerted to arrest the bishop, who was conducted to Normandy, and being imprisoned in the castle of Rouen, was kept there in close custody four years, that is, as long as the king lived. `[The Saxon Chronicle, followed by Roger de Hoveden and others, places the arrest of Bishop Odo in the year 1082 (in the autumn), consequently his captivity must have continued for live, or nearly five, years.]`

The chief disturber of the peace being thus laid low, the knights returned to their duty, and, by the king's wisdom, his throne was fortified against all attacks from within or without.

In this prelate we see clearly exemplified what Eulgentius says, in his book on Mythology: ' "The man who makes pretensions to which he is not entitled, will sink lower than he is."

The bishopric of Bayeux, and the rich earldom of Kent, and the exercise of royal power in common with his own through England and Normandy, was not enough for one clerk, who aspired to the government of the whole world, moved neither by Divine inspiration nor a canonical election, but by the impulses of his own insatiable ambition.

He lost therefore what he already possessed, was left to pine in captivity, and has left a warning to posterity not to be too eager in the pursuit of honours.




p402

At length, his disorder continually increasing, and perceiving that inevitable death was becoming imminent, he became anxious about the future, which was veiled from his sight, reflecting on which with deep concern, he was frequently moved to sighs and groans. He summoned to his side his sons William Eufus and Henry, who Avere in attendance on him with some of his friends, and gave them many wise and prudent directions for the regulation of his states. Robert, his eldest son, had long since entered on a course of repeated quarrels with his father, and had recently taken umbrage in consequence of some new follies, and retired to the court of the king of France.

The wise king hastened to make provision for the future welfare of himself and others, ordering all his treasures to be distributed among the churches, the poor, and the ministers of God. He exactly specified the amount to be given to eacli, and gave directions to the notaries to reduce it to writing in his own presence. He also contritely sent large donations to the clergy of Mantes, to be applied to the restoration of the churches he had burnt. He gave admonitions to all who were present relative to the maintenance of justice and good faith, keeping the law of God and peace, the privileges of the churches, and observing the rules of the fathers. His eloquent discourse, worthy to be held in everlasting remembrance, and at times interrupted by tears, v;as to the following effect.

Victrix, it is believed, having obtained some relics of St. Gervase and St. Proteus (discovered by St. Ambrose in 38G), placed this church under their invocation. It is at least certain that the crypt is the most ancient Christian monument :n Normandy. Roman bricks are built into the wall. Duke Richard II. gave this church to the abbey of Fecamp. The priory erected by the monks, and in which King William breathed his last, stood to the south of the church.

A.D. 1087.] THE CONQUEEOE'S DYING WOEDS. ttOS

Cn. XV. Discourse of King William the Conqueror on his death-bed, in which he recapitulates the principal events of his life — His disposition of his treasure and states.

"I tremble," he said, "my friends, when I reflect on the grievous sins which burden my conscience, and now about to be summoned before the awful tribunal of God, I know not what I ought to do. I was bred to arms from my childhood, and am stained with the rivers of blood I have shed. It is out of my power to enumerate all the injuries which I have caused during the sixty-four^ years of my troublesome life, for which I am now called to render account without delay to the most righteous Judge. At the time my father went into voluntary exile, entrusting to me the duchy of Normandy, I was a mere youth of the age of eight years, and from that time to this I have always borne the weight of arms. I have now ruled this duchy fifty-six years,- amidst the difficulties of incessant wars. My own subjects have often conspired against me, and shamefully exposed me to serious losses and great injuries. They have perfidiously put to death Turketil my guardian,^ Osberne, son of Hirfast,* steward of Normandy; Count Grilbert, the father of his country,^ and many others, who were the pillars of the state.

In these trials I had proof of the fidelity of my people: often by night I was secretly taken from the chamber of my palace by my uncle Walter,*' through fear of my own

"The Normans, when under the rule of a kind but firm master, are a most valiant people, excelling all others in the invincible courage with which they meet difficulties, and strive to conquer every enemy. But under other circumstances they rend in pieces and ruin each other. They are eager for rebellion, ripe for tumults, and ready for ever}- sort of crime. They must therefore be restrained by the strong hand of justice, and compelled to walk in the right way by the reins of discipline. But if they are allowed to take their own course without any yoke and like an untamed colt, they and their princes will be overwhelmed with poverty^ shame, and confusion. I have learnt this by much experience. My nearest friends, my own kindred, who ought to have defended me at all hazards against the whole world, have formed conspiracies, and rebelling against me, nearly stripped me of the inheritance of my fathers.

"Guy, son of Reynold, duke of Burgundy,^ by my aunt Adeliza, returned me evil for good. I had kindly received him on his arrival from a foreign country, and treated him with the regard due to an only brother, giving him Vernon, Brionne,^ and an important part of my Norman territories. Notwithstanding this, he did all in his power to injure me, both by word and deed, calling me bastard, degenerate and unworthy to reign, and defaming me as if I had been his enemy. Need I add more? Breaking his fealty, he rebelled against me, seduced from my service Eanulf de Bayeux,^ Haymon-aux-Dents,* Nigel du Cotentin,^ and many others, forcing them by his nefarious counsels to be partakers of his perjury. Eegardless therefore of the homage and fealty which he had sworn to me, he strove to strip me of the whole of Normandy. Thus, while I was yet a beardless

youth, I found myself compelled to take up arms agamst him, and to fight on the plain of Yal-des-Dunes^ against my cousin and liege man. Then, by the help of God,^ the righteous judge, I conquered my foes between Caen and Argences,^ and having by His permission utterly defeated them, I obtained entire possession of my paternal rights.

Sending forward to Arques some light troops who were eager for the fray, I followed myself" with the main body, which was far from considerable, to lay siege to the castle. But before 1 reached the country between the two rivers, the Sie and the Garenne, the advanced guard fell in with Count Engelran pushing forv,' ard to occupy the fortress, and killed him, fighting bravely, for he was a valiant knight, and routed his squadrons. Pressing the siege closely, I compelled the perjured count to go into banishment, and did not permit him to return to the domains he lost during all the days of his life.^ I also, by virtue of a papal decree, deposed the insolent archbishop, who neither observed his fealty to me, nor his duty to Grod, and raised to the see the venerable monk Maurilius who was providentially sent from Elorence, an Italian city.*

"Henry, in all the plenitude of his royal power and the fervour of his chivalrous spirit, has been often seen at the instigation of my enemies, to trample me under his feet as a defenceless man, endeavouring to crush me and impose upon me unjust conditions. He has made frequent irruptions into my territories at the head of large armies, but he has never been able to triumph in the spoils and booty he has gained, or the captives he has made among my subjects. He has often crossed the frontiers with great military pomp, and terrible menaces, but he has never returned to his own kingdom without sorrow and shame. He has brought in his train numbers of most valiant men, who, alas! never saw their own country again, having fallen by my sword and the arms of my followers.

"On one occasion, King Henry, was so enraged against me, that he invaded my territories with a vast army in two divisions, in order to overwhehn them by a double attack.^ He led one body of troops himself into the diocese of Evreux, and ravaged the whole country on this side the Seine, while he gave the command of the other division to his brother Eudes,- with Eeynold de Clermont, and the two counts, Ealph de Montdidier,^ and Guy de Ponthieu,*, with orders to enter Normandy by the fords of the Epte,^ and, carrying fire and sword through Brai and the Talois, with the whole dis- trict of Kouen, to continue their devastations to the sea-

* This double invasion of Normandy by the French was made in the begianing of spring, 1054, before Lent (February 16). It appears to have been intended to revenge the ill-success of the former campaign before Arques.

'^ Eudes, fourth son of King Robert and Constance, who died without having been married, appears to have been a prince of slender abilities. Odo namque nimis stultus erat, is the blunt language of a cotemporary chronicler.

' Ralph III., called the Great, comte de Valois and Amiens in 1030, in right of his father, Ralph II., re-united to it Pontoise, Mantes, and great part of the Vexin, after the death of his cousin Walter in 1063. See before, p. 79. He never bore the title of Comte de Montdidier ^iven him by our author, and only possessed that place by depriving his cousin- german, Rothais daughter and heiress of Eudes, comte de Montdidier of it. Having married twice, he divorced his second wife to marry the queen, Anne of Russia, widow of Henry I. Faithful to his habits of violence and usurpation, towards the close of his life (about 1071 or 1072) he seized the castle of Peronne^ of which exploit he was so proud that he afterwards used no other title but that of Ralph de P^ronne. He died at Montdidier, Sept. 8, 1074, under excommunication for his divorce, and was buried in the priory of Notre-Dame in that town.

Simon de Cr^pi, his son and successor, led a life as pure and holy as that of Ralph had been violent and criminal. One of his first cares was to restore Montdidier to the right heirs, and to disinter his father's body, and have it conveyed to his own patrimony at Crepi. This exhumation was made on March 22, 1076. Simon, who was present, was so shocked at the appearance of his father's corpse, that it was a new motive for his quitting the world and devoting himself to a monastic life, which he shortly afterwards did, although his friends, to withdraw him from it, brought about his marriage with Judith, daughter of Robert Comte d'Auvergne. The new married pair made vows of chastity on the day of their union, and both embraced a religious life. Simon was one of the nearest relatives and most devoted friends of Queen Matilda.

Stationing myself with part of my troops along the bank of the Seine against the king's tents, I kept him in check, and was ready to fall upon the enemy at whatever point he attempted to ravage my territories. Meanwhile, I detached against Eudes and his division Robert, Count d'Eu, with Eoger de Mortemer,^ and other distinguished knights; who, encountering the French near the castle of Mortemer, the line of battle was formed by both armies, and a desperate engagement ensued, in which the carnage was enormous, for the combatants on both sides were full of ardour and resolved not to yield but with their lives. On one side, the French made furious assaults, inspired by the ^ope of gaining the spoils of the victory; on the other, the Normans struck home, animated by their determination to repel the enemy and defend their lives and possessions. Tliis battle w^as fought beyond the Seine in the winter season, before Lent, eight years after that of Yal-des-Dunes.' Gruy, count of Ponthieu, was taken prisoner and Eudes, E-eynold, and others were put to flight, owing their escape to "the speed with which they ran away. Count Ealph [de Yalois] would also have been taken, if Eoger, my commander-in-chief, had not favoured his escape on account of the fealty he had formerly sworn to him. In acting thus, in the hour of the count's utmost need, he paid him a noble and legitimate service; receiving him in his castle, where he entertained him three days, and afterwards conducting him in safety to his own territories. Notwithstanding, for this breach of his duty to me, I banished Eobert from Normandy, but, being soon afterwards reconciled with him, restored him all his domains, except the castle of Mortemer, iu which he had sheltered my enemy; which I think he justly forfeited, and I granted it to his cousin AVilliam de A¥arrene,^ one of my loyal young vassals.

William, as we have just seen, had marched in person against the king of France, who bad crossed the Seine. It was between their two camps, separated, probably, by only a small interval, that Ralph de Toni executed his commission. According to Robert Wace, he cUmbed up into a tree, but Ralph de Diceto says he stood on a hillock: "It was night when, standing on a neighbouring^ hill, he began to shout aloud, "My name is Ralph de Toni, and I bring you melancholy, news; hasten with your chariots and cars to Mortemer, to carry otf the bodies of the slain. The French have chosen to encounter the Norman chivalry, and have found its assault more severe than they expected. Eudes, the king's brother, has fled, and Guy, count of Ponthieu, is a captive.

king of France witli an account of what Lad occurred on the left bank of the Seine. On hearing the news, which reached him in the dead of the night, King Henry lost not a moment in putting his troops in motion, and, having made a precipitate retreat, from that hour he has never reposed for a single night on my territories.

"Thus, from my very infancy, I have been continually involved in numberless embarassments, but, by God's mercy, I have freed myself from them all with the highest honour. I became in consequence an object of jealousy to all my neighbours, but by His aid in whom I always put my trust, none of them were able to prevail against me. The Bretons and Anjevins have found this; the French and Flemings are witnesses of it; the Manceaux have severely felt it.

"Geoffrey Martel, count of Anjou,^ Conan, duke of Brittany,^ and Eobert the Frisian, count of Flanders,^ engaged in perfidious enterprises against me; but as God was my protector, though they made great efforts and laid many snares for me, they were never able to accomplish their designs. I have placed on my brow a royal diadem, which none of my predecessors wore, having acquired it by the grace of God, not by hereditary right. It would be difficult for me to recount my labours beyond sea, and the perilous conflicts in which I have been engaged with the people of Exeter, Chester, and JN^orthumbria, with the Scots and Welsh, Norwegians, Danes, and other adversaries who attempted to deprive me of the crown of England: in all which I obtained the victory. But much as human ambition is disposed to triumph in such successes, I am a prey to cruel fears and anxieties when I reflect with what barbari-

ties they were attended, I therefore liumblj entreat you, the priests and ministers of Christ, to commend me in your prayers to Almighty God for the forgiveness of the sins with which my conscience is burdened, and that through his inexhaustible mercy he will vouchsafe to grant me salvation among his elect. I direct my treasure to be given to the churches and the poor, that what was amassed in crime may be dispersed among the saints and applied to holy uses. Por you ought to remember how dearly I have loved ' you, and how stoutly I have defended you against all your enemies.

"I have never injured the church of God, which is our mother, but have always paid her, as circumstances demanded, due honour. I never sold ecclesiastical dignities. I prohibited simony, which I always detested. In the election of prelates my choice was directed by meritorious conduct and wise doctrine, and as far as it has been in my power the government of the church has been committed to the most worthy. This may be truly proved by my selection of Lan- franc, archbishop of Canterbury; of Anselm, abbot of Bee; Grerbert, abbot of rontenelles; Durand, of Troarn; and many other doctors of my realm, whose praise, I think, is spread to the ends of the earth. Such were the associates with whom I conversed, and in whose society I learnt the maxims of wisdom and truth; so that I always delighted to receive their counsels.

"Nine abbeys of monks and one of nuns, founded in Normandy^ by my predecessors, have, under God's blessing, been augmented by my care, nobly enriched with the splendid endowments of various kinds I have conferred upon them. Moreover, during the time I have governed the duchy, seventeen convents of monks and six of nuns have been erected,^ in which the full service is regularly

performed, and large alms are daily distributed for the love of the King Supreme. "With such fortresses Normandy is well protected, and in them men are taught to combat the demons and the sins of the flesh. By God's inspiration all these abbeys have been either of my creation or foundation, and I became their zealous benefactor and kind promoter. Moreover, all the endowments, whether in lands or other revenues, which my barons have given to God and his saints, for the good of their souls, both in Normandy and England, I have graciously confirmed, and have gratuitously ratified by my princely authority the charters granting them, against all claims and pretensions.

"Such have been my cares from my earliest years, and these duties I leave to my successors to be observed in all time to come. In these, my sons, constantly follow my example, that you may be honoured for ever before God and men. I especially exhort you, who are my own flesh, to cultivate unceasingly the society of good and wise men, and to submit to their rule in all things, if you desire to possess durable glory. From the teaching of pious philosophers you will learn to discern good from evil, to adhere to justice on all occasions, and to spare no pains in avoiding iniquity; to be merciful protectors of the weak, the poor, and the pious, while you bridle and put down the proud and malicious: to refrain from injuring simple folk, to frequent with devotion the services of holy church, to love the worship of God above all riches, and to observe unweariedly the divine law by day and by night, in prosperity and in adversity.

"I granted the dukedom of Normandy to my son Robert, because he was the eldest,^ before I fought against Harold on the heath ^ of Senlac. He has already received the homage of nearly all the barons of this land. The grant thus made and ratified I cannot annul. But I know for (pertain that the country which is subject to his dominion will be truly wretclied. He is a proud and silly prodigal, and will have long to sufier severe misfortune.

"I appoint no one my heir to the crown of England, but leave it to the disposal of the Eternal Creator, whose I am, and who ordereth all things. For I did not attain that high honour by hereditary right, but I wrested it from the perjured king Harold in a desperate battle, with much effusion of human blood, and it was by the slaughter and banishment of his adherents, that I subjugated England to my rule. I have persecuted its native inhabitants beyond all reason. Whether nobles or commons, I have cruelly oppressed them; many I unjustly disinherited; innumerable multitudes, especially in the county of York, perished through me by famine or the sword. Thus it happened: ^ the Deiri and other people beyond the Humber called in the troops of Sweyn, king of Denmark, as their auxiliaries against me, and put to the sword Eobert Comyn and a thousand soldiers within the walls of Durham, as well as others, my barons and most esteemed knights, in various places.^ These events inflamed me to the highest pitch of resentment, and I fell on the English of the northern counties like a raving lion. I commanded their houses and corn, with all their imple- ments and furniture, to be burnt without distinction, and large herds of cattle and beasts of burden, to be butchered wherever they were found. It was thus that I took revenge on multitudes of both sexes by subjecting them to the calamity of a cruel famine; and by so doing, alas me! became the barbarous murderer of many thousands, both young and old, of that fine race of people. Having, therefore, made my way to the throne of that kingdom by so many crimes, I dare not leave it to any one but God alone, le.st after my death worse should happen by my means.

While King William discoursed thus, with much more to the same effect, and the bystanders who cautiously scanned the dim prospects of the future, were lost in amazement, Henry, his youngest son, hearing that no provision was made for him out of the royal wealth, said sorrowfully to the king: "And what, my father, do you give me?" to which the king replied: "I bequeath to you five thousand pounds of silver from my treasury." Upon which Henry said: "What shall I do with this money, having no corner of earth which I can call my own?" To which the king answered: "My son, be contented with your lot, and trust in the Lord. Suffer patiently your elder brothers to precede you. Robert will have Normandy, and William England. But you, also, in your turn, will succeed to all the dominions which belong to me, and you will surpass your brothers in wealth and power." After he had said this, the king, fearing lest in such extended territories some sudden tumults might burst forth, addressed a letter to Lanfranc the archbishop, on the appointment of a successor to the throne, and affixing his seal, gave it to his son William Rufus, commanding him to embark for England without delay. He then kissed him, and, giving him his blessing, directed him to hasten his departure and cross the sea to secure the crown. The prince lost no time in riding to the port of Wissant, `[Wissant, which was a celebrated port in the middle ages, is situated between Boulogne and Calais, about four leagues and a half from the former. In his tenth book our author makes William Rufus embark at the port of Touque.]` and there he received intelligence of his father's death. Henry was equally prompt in securing the money allotted to him. He had it carefully weighed that there might be no deficiency, and, summoning his intimate friends in whom he could confide, sought a place of safety in which to deposit his treasure.

Meanwhile the physicians and royal attendants in charge of the dying prince, together with the nobles who had come to visit him, took an opportunity of speaking in favour of the captives who were detained in prison, humbly entreating him to have pity on them and grant their release. The king replied to them: "I have long kept in captivity Morcar, the noble English earl; in this I have been unjust, but my fear has been that if he were liberated he would raise disturbances in the kingdom of England. `[See before, b. iv. c. 7, p. 45.]` I threw into prison Roger de Breteuil `[See ib. p. 82.]` who opposed me with bitter animosity, and stirred up against me his brother-in-law Ralph de Guader and many others, and I swore that he should not be set free as long as I lived. In like manner I confined many persons to punish them for their own offences, and others to prevent their causing future rebellions. Justice requires this, and the divine law, through Moses, commands the rulers of the world to restrain the guilty that the innocent may not perish. `[We are not able to discover any passage of this kind in the Pentateuch.]` Being now, however, at the point of death, as I hope to be saved and, by God's mercy, absolved from my sins, I order that the prison doors shall be forthwith thrown open, and all the prisoners, except my brother, the bishop of Bayeux, be released and suffered to go free, for the love of God, that He also may have mercy on me. But they are not to be liberated, but on condition that they first take an oath to my ministers, for the security of the state, that they will use every means to preserve the peace both in Normandy and in England, and will stedfastly resist the enemies of tranquillity to the utmost of their power."

When Robert, earl of Morton, heard that by the king's decision his brother was condemned to perpetual imprisonment he was much distressed. Herluin de Conteville `[Conteville-sur-mer, near the mouth of the Risle.]` had married Harleve, the concubine of Duke Robert, by whom he had two sons. Odo and Robert. William, who was first duke and afterwards king, had heaped honours and possessions on his father-in-law both in Kormandy and England, and had enriched with large domains his sons, Ralph, born of another wife `[This is the only notice we have of this eldest son of Herluin de Conteville, and half-brother of the Conqueror.]` and Robert and Odo, his own uterine brothers. For having expelled from Normandy on slight pretences William, surnamed Werlenge, count of Morton, son of Count Mauger, `[William de Jumièges (b. vii. c. 19) relates the circumstances under which William Werlene forfeited the earldom of Morton.]` he had conferred the county of Morton on Robert, son of Herluin, and thus his own brother. Moreover, on the death of Hugh, bishop of Bayeux, son of Count Mauger, `[Ralph comte d'Ivri. It was in 1040 that William gave his brother the bishopric of Bayeux, vacant by the death of William d'Ivri.]` he gave that bishopric to his brother Odo, whom he afterwards made earl of Kent in England. At length, King William arrested him in the Isle of Wight, `[See before, c. viii. p. 372, et seq. for the details of this transaction.]` on account of his overweening pride, as I have before fully related, and having detained him four years in prison, was unwilling, such was the insolence of Odo, to release him even when he was himself at the point of death. In consequence, the earl of Morton, of whom I have lately spoken, was sorely afflicted, and, by his own supplications and those of his friends on behalf of his brother, wearied the suffering prince.

The king was exhausted by the numerous solicitations from so many quarters for the release of the bishop of Bayeux; but at length he said: "I wonder that your penetration has not discovered the character of the man for whom you supplicate me. Are not you making petitions for a prelate who has long held religion in contempt, and who is the subtle promoter of fatal divisions? Have I not already incarcerated for four years this bishop, who when he ought to have proved himself exemplary in the just government of England, became a most cruel oppressor of the people, and destroyer of the convents of monks? In desiring the liberation of this seditious man, you are ill-advised, and are bringing on yourselves a serious calamity. It is clear that my brother Odo is a man not to be trusted, ambitious, given to fleshly desires, and of enormous cruelty; and that he will never be converted from his whoredoms and ruinous follies, I satisfied myself of this on several occasions, and therefore I imprisoned, not the bishop, but the tyrannical earl. There is no doubt that if he is released, he will disturb the whole country and be the ruin of thousands. I say this not from hatred, as if I were his enemy, but as the father of my country, watching for the welfare of a Christian people. It would indeed give me inexpressible and heart-felt joy to think that he would conduct himself with chastity and moderation, as it always becomes a priest and minister of God." `[Whatever amplifications our author may have made in the speeches which he has put into the king's mouth (a practice we find him frequently pursuing in common with most ancient historians), it does appear that Odo was excepted from the general amnesty, and the sequel of the history will show how well his brother had penetrated the real character of this voluptuous and turbulent prelate.]`

All the friends of the bishop pledging themselves for his reformation, the king further said: "Whether I will or not, your petition shall be granted, but after my death there will immediately be a violent change in affairs. It is against my own judgment that I permit my brother to be liberated from confinement, for be assured that he will cause the death or the grievous injury of many persons. Further, as I have declared the forfeiture of all the lands of Baudri, son of Nicholas, `[Baudri de Guitri. This offence must have been very recent, as we have seen Baudri, in 1085, fighting bravely in William's service in Maine. This lord held a fief at Bocquencé under the abbey of St. Evroult, and must have been personally known to our author, who makes frequent and honourable mention of him.]` as a punishment for his folly in quitting my service and going to Spain without my licence, I now restore him his domains for the love of God. I do not think that a braver knight exists, but he is prodigal and inconstant, and loves to wander in foreign countries."

Thus King William, though tormented with excruciating pains in his intestines, preserved throughout the full possession of his clearness of intellect and power of expressing himself with his usual vivacity; and gave with readiness useful counsels to all who addressed themselves to him on the affairs of the state.

At length, on Tuesday, the fifth of the ides [the 9th] of September, `[William died, as before stated, on September 9, 1037.]` the king waking just when the sun was beginning to shed his rays on the earth, heard the sound of the great bell of the cathedral of Eouen. On his inquiring what it meant, his attendants replied: "My Lord, the bell is tolling for primes in the church of St. Mary." Then the king, raised his eyes to heaven with deep devotion, and lifting up his hands said: "I commend myself to Mary, the holy mother of God, my heavenly mistress, that by her blessed intercession I may be reconciled to her well-beloved Son, our Lord Jesus Christ." Having said this he instantly expired. The physicians and others who were present, who had watched the king all night while he slept, his repose neither broken by cries or groans, seeing him now expire so suddenly and unexpectedly, were much astonished, and became as men who had lost their wits. Notwithstanding, the wealthiest of them mounted their horses and departed in haste to secure their property. But the inferior attendants, observing that their masters had disappeared, laid hands on the arms, the plate, the robes, the linen, and all the royal furniture, and leaving the corpse almost naked on the floor of the house hastened away.

Observe then, I pray you, my readers, how little trust can be placed in human fidelity. All these servants snatched up what they could of the royal effects, like so many kites, and took to their heels with their booty. Roguery thus came forth from its hiding place the moment the great justiciary was dead, and first exercised its rapacity round the corpse of him who had so long repressed it.

ODO (d. 1097), bishop of Bayeux and earl of Kent, was son of Herluin of Conteville hy Herleva of Falaise, the concubine of Robert of Normandy, and mother of William the Conqueror. Guibert of Nogent actually calls Odo natural son of Duke Robert, and own brother to William the Conqueror (*De Sanotorum Pignoribus*, i. ch. 3). William of Malmesbury (*Gesta Regum*, p. 888) expressly states that Herluin and Harleva were married before Duke Robert's death in 1035; but Odo, who was their eldest son, was perhaps not born before 1036, Odo's younger brother was Robert of Mortain [q. v.], and he had also two sisters; Muriel, who married Odo cum Capello (Waoh, 6026), and another, who married the Sire de la Ferté (Taylor, Translation of Wace, p. 237; Stapleton, Rot. Scacc. Norm. i. p. lxxix). Herluin had another son, Ralph, by a former marriage. Odo received the bishopric of Bayeux from his brother William about October 1049 (Ordurious Vitalis, iii. 263, note 2), and, as bishop, witnesses a charter of St. Evroul on 26 Sept. 1050 (ib. v. 180). He witnesses various charters during the subsequent years, and was present at ecclesiastical councils held at Rouen in 1055, 1061, and 1063. He was present at the council held at Lillebonne in 1066 to consider the projeoted invasion of England, and, according to one account, contributed one hundred ships to the fleet (Lyttelton, Hist. of Henry II, i. 523), though Wace (6186) assigns him forty only. Odo accompanied the Norman host, and not only exhorted the soldiers the night before the battle, but, despite his ecclesiastical character, fought in fall armour at Hastings, though armed with a mace instead of a sword. When the Normans turned in flight, Odo was prominent in rallying the fugitives, and is so depicted in the Bayeux tapestry (Wace, 8131).

After his coronation William bestowed on Odo the castle of Dover and earldom of Kent; and when, three months later, the king crossed over to Normandy, Odo and William FitzOsbern [q. v.] were left as viceroys in his absence, Odo's special care as Earl of Kent was to secure communication with the continent, and to guard against attack from that quarter. The rule of the viceroys was harsh in the extreme; 'they wrought castles wide amongst the people, and poor folk oppressed' (*English Chronicle*); they protected their plundering and licentious followers, and paid no heed to the complaints of the English; while their zeal for William's policy of castle-building served to increase their unpopularity (Flor. Wig. ii. 1). While Odo was absent to the north of the Thames, the men of Kent called in Eustace of Boulogne; but, though Eustace was repulsed by the Norman garrison of Dover, the discontent with the rule of his viceroys compelled William to hurry back to England in December 1067. Odo did not again hold a position of equal authority; but for fifteen years he was second in power only to William himself. William of Malmesbury styles him 'Totius Anglise vicedominus sub rege;' and Orderic says: 'Veluti secundus rex passim jura dabat.' There is, however, no sufficient reason to describe him as justiciar, though from time to time he discharged functions which were afterwards exercised by that officer (see Stubbs, *Constitutional History*, § 120). Orderic also describes Odo as 'palatinus Cantiae consul;' but it is uncertain whether he ever really possessed the regalia as a true palatine earl, or even bore the title of earl, though he certainly exercised the jurisdiction of the ealdorman (ib. § 124). Still he witnesses charters as 'Comes Cantiae,' and in 1102 his nephew, William of Mortain, unsuccessfully claimed the earldom of Kent as his heir (Will. Malm. *Gesta Regum*, p. 473). Besides a great number of lordships in Kent, Odo received lands in twelve other counties (*Domesday Book*, esp. pp. 6-11), and acquired vast wealth, in part at least, hy the spoliation of abbeys and churches. The most famous instance of such spoliation was his usurpation of certain rights and possessions of the see of Canterbury. Lanfranc claimed restitution, and by William's order the suit was heard before the shire-moot of Kent at Penenden Heath, with the result that Odo had to surrender his spoil (*Anglia Sacra*, i. 334-5). The abbeys of Ramsey and of Evesham, the latter of which lost a large port of its lands in a contention with Odo, were less fortunate (*Chron. Ramsey*, p. 154; *Hist. Evesham*, pp, 96-7, both in Rolls Ser.) On the other hand, Odo wsb a benefactor of St, Augustine's, Canterbury (*Hist. St. Augustine's*, pp, 350-3, Rolls Ser.), and as justiiar redressed the wrong that Picot, the Norman sheriff of Cambridgeshire, had done to the see of Rochester (A*nglia Sacra*, i, 886-9).

Odo was present at the synod which, at Whitsuntide 1072, decided on the claims of Canterbury. In 1075 he was one of the leaders of the host which suppressed the rising of Ralph Guader [q. v.j in Norfolk (Flor. Wig. ii. 11), On 23 Oct. 1177 he was present at the consecration of the church of Bec (*Chron. Beccense* ap. Migne, *Patrologia*, cl. 646). In 1080 he presided in a court which decided on the liberties of Ely (*Hist. Eliensis*, pp, 251-2), and in June 1081 was present when the claims of the abbey of Bury St. Edmunds were decided (*Memorials of St. Edmund's Abbey*, i. 347-9, Rolls Scr.) In 1080 Odo was sent by William to take vengeance on Northumberland for the murder of Bishop Walcher [q. v.] of Durham. The whole county was harried, the innocent and guilty were punished indiscriminately, and Odo himself carried off from Durham a pastoral staff of rare workmanship and material (Sym. Dunelm. ii. 210-11).

Odo had now reached the zenith of his career; but by means of his wealth he hoped to rise yet higher, A soothsayer had foretold that the successor of Hildebrand should bear the name of Odo. This prophecy the Bishop of Bayeux thought to realise in his own person, So 'stuffing the pilgrims' wallets with letters and coin' (Will. Malm, *Gesta Regum*, p. 331), he bribed the leading Roman citizens, and even built himself a palace, which he adorned with such splendour that there was no house like it at Rome (*Liber de Hyda*, p. 206). Odo further determined to go to Rome in person, and, having bribed Hugh, carl of Chester, and many other Norman knights to accompany him, was on the poiut of setting out from England when William heard of his designs. The king hurried across from Normandy, and met Odo on the Isle of Wight. There, in an assembly, William set forth his brother's oppressions, exactions, and intended ambitions. Despite William's orders, no one would arrest the bishop, and the King seized him with his own hands, meeting Odo's protest with a declaration that he arrested, not the bishop, but the earl. Wace (9199-9248) alleges that Odo's intention was to secure the crown for himself in case of William's death, and that the immediate cause of his arrest was his failure to render an account of his revenues. Gregory VII severely censured the treatment of the bishop, both in a letter to William himself, and in another to Hugh, archbishop of Lyons (Jafff, *Monumenta Gregoriana*, pp. 519, 571). Odo was, however, kept in captivity at Rouen for over four years. When William, on his deathbed, ordered his prisoners to be released he specially excepted his brother; but on the urgent entreaty of Robert of Mortain and others, at length gave way. Odo was at once set free, and was present at his brother's funeral at Caen. He speedily recovered all his ancient honour in Normandy and, according to Orderic, already plotted to displace William Rufus by Robert in England. In the autumn of 1087 be went over to England, regained his earldom, and was present at William II's first midwinter council. But he could not recover his old importance; and, being envious of the superior authority of William of St. Calais, bishop of Durham, he now became the centre of the Norman conspiracy against William. When the war broke out, in Lent 1088, Odo himself plundered Kent, and especially the lands of Lanfranc, to whose advice his four years' imprisonment was said to have been due (Will. Malm. *Gesta Regum*, p. 361). The king marched against his uncle in person, and captured Tunbridge Castle. At the news, Odo fled to his brother Robert at Pevensey, where, after a six week's siege, he was compelled to yield, promising to surrender Rochester also, and then leave England. For this purpose Odo was sent with a guard to Rochester; but the bishop's friends rescued him, and refused to give up the city. A fresh siege soon forced Odo to seek peace once more; but it was only after a remonstrance from his advisers that William would grant any terms, and even then the bishop's petition for the honours of war was indignantly rejected. The English in William's army cried! 'Halters! halters for the traitor bishop! Let not the doer of evil go unharmed!' Odo was, however, permitted to depart, but with the loss of all his possessions in England, to which country he never returned. Odo aspired with more success to hold the first place in Normandy under the weak rule of Robert. It was by his advice that, in the autumn of 1088, the duke's brother Henry and Robert of Bollcme [q.v.] were arrested; and when the news brought Roger of Montgomery [q. v.] to Normandy, Odo urged his nephew to destroy the power of tho house of Talvas. He also took a prominent part in the campaign of Mans in 1089, and in the opposition to William's invasion of Normandy in 1091 (Ordericus Vitalis, iv. 16). According to Ordericus, it was Odo who, in 1093, performed the marriage ceremony between Philip of France and the infamous Bertrada of Montfort, receiving as his reward certain churches at Mantes; but it seems probable that he did no more than countenance the union by his presence (ib. iii. 387, and M. Le Prevost's note ad loc.) Odo was present at the council of Clermont in November 1005, when Pope Urban II proclaimed the first crusade, and at the synod of the Norman bishops at Rouen in the following February, when the acts of the council were considered, When Robert of Normandy took the cross, Odo elected to accompany him rather than remain at home under the rule of his enemy William; so in September 1090 he left Normandy. With hie nephew Robert he visited Roms, and received the papal blessing. Duke Robert wintered in Apulia; but Odo crossed over to Sicily, where in February 1097 he died at Palermo. He was buried in the cathedral, where Count Roger of Sicily built him a splendid tomb.

In history Odo figures, not unnaturally, as a turbulent noble, who had nothing of the ecclesiastic but the name. Ordericus makes the Conqueror describe him as fickle and ambitious, the slave of fleshly lust and monstrous cruelty, who would never abandon his vain and wanton wickedness; the scorner of religion, the artful author of sedition, the oppressor of the people, the plunderer of churches, whose release meant certain mischief to many. But. Ordericus himself is perhaps more just when he says that Odo's character was a mixture of vices and virtues, in which affection for secular affairs prevailed over tho good deeds of the spiritual life. William of Poitiers (209 A.B.), writing perhaps before Odo's fall, eulogises him for his eloquence and wisdom in council and debate, for his liberality, justice, and loyalty to his brother; 'he had no wish to use arms, but rejoiced in necessary war so far as religion permitted him. Normans and Bretons served under him gladly, and even the English were not so barbarous that they could not recognise in tho bishop and earl a man who was to he feared, respected, and loved.' While Odo was thus devoted to secular affairs, and so far forgetful of his sacred calling that he had a son (named John), he was nevertheless a liberal patron of religion and learning. He endowed his own church at Bayeux with much wealth, and rebuilt the cathedral: the lower part of the western towers and the crypt are relics of his work. He established monks in the church of St. Vigor at Bayeux, but afterwards in 1096 bestowed his foundation, as a cell, on the abbey of Dijon (Charter ap. Migne, clv. 475-6). Guibert describes a curious instance of Odo's zeal for sacred relics (*De Sanctorum Pignoribus*, i. 3). Odo also had instructed, at his own expense, a number of scholars, among whom were Thomas, archbishop of York, and his brother Samson, bishop of Worcester; and Thurstan, abbot of Glastonbury. Another dependent of Odo's was Arnulf, the first Latin patriarch of Jerusalem, who accompanied the Bishop of Bayeux on his departure from Normandy in 1096, and owed his subsequent promotion to the wealth bequeathed him by his patron (Guibert of Nogdnt, *Gesta Dei per Francos*, viii. 1). It is possible that, among Odo's benefactions to his cathedral, we must include the famous Bayeux tapestry, which was perhaps executed for him by English artists (Freeman, *Norman Conquest*, iii. 562-572).

When Ordericus wrote, Odo's son John was living at the court of Henry I. John was perhaps the father of Robert 'nepos episcopi,' who married the heiress of William du Hommet, and by her left a son, Richard de Humez, who became hereditary constable of Normandy (Stapleton, *Rot. Scacc. Norm.* ii. pp. clxxxii-clxxxiv).

[William I]

He [William the Conqueror] treated his mother, who, before the death of his father, had married one Herlewin de Conteville, a man of moderate wealth, with singular indulgence as long as she lived. William's brothers, by this match, were Robert, a man of heavy, sluggish disposition, whom he made earl of Moreton; and Odo, whom, while he was earl, he made bishop of Bayeux; and when king, created him earl of Kent. Being of quicker talents than the other, he was governor of all England, under the king, after the death of William Fitz-Osberne. He had wonderful skill in accumulating treasure; possessed extreme craft in dissembling: so that, though absent, yet, stuffing the scrips of the pilgrims with letters and money, he had nearly purchased the Roman papacy from the citizens. But when, through the rumour of his intended journey, soldiers eagerly flocked to him from all parts of the kingdom, the king, taking offence, threw him into confinement; saying, that he did not seize the bishop of Bayeux, but the earl of Kent. His partisans being intimidated by threats, discovered such quantities of gold, that the heap of precious metal would surpass the belief of the present age; and, at last, many sackfuls of wrought gold were also taken out of the rivers, which he had secretly buried in certain places. When released, at the death of his brother, he joined Robert's party, as he was averse to his nephew William : but then too matters turning out unfavourably, he was banished England, and went over to his nephew and his bishopric in Normandy. Afterwards, proceeding with him on his enterprize to Jerusalem, he died at Antioch while it was besieged by the Christians.

Of William the Second, [a.d. 1087—1100.]

William then, the son of William, was born in Normandy many years before his father came to England; and being educated with extreme care by his parents, as he had naturally an ambitious mind, he at length reached the summit of dignity. He would no doubt have been a prince incomparable in our time, had not his father's greatness eclipsed him; and had not the fates cut short his years too early for his maturer age to correct errors, contracted by the licentiousness of power, and the impetuosity of youth. When childhood was passed, he spent the period of youth in military occupations; in riding, throwing the dart, contending with his elders in obedience, with those of his own age in action: and he esteemed it injurious to his reputation, if he was not the foremost to take arms in military commotions; unless he was the first to challenge the adversary, or when challenged, to overcome him. To his father he was ever dutiful; always exerting himself in his sight in battle, ever at his side in peace. His hopes gradually expanding, he already aspired after the succession, especially on the rejection of his elder brother, while the tender age of the younger gave him no uneasiness. Thus, adopted as his suct cesser by his father during his last illness, he set out to take possession of the kingdom ere the king had breathed his last: where being gladly received by the people, and obtaining the keys of the treasury, he by these means subjected all England to his will. Archbishop Lanfranc, the grand mover of every thing, had educated him, and made him a knight, `["At this period the custom of receiving knighthood from the hands of bishops or abbats yet obtained. There is a law of Henry I., prohibiting abbats from making knights." — Hardy.]` and now he favoured his pretensions to the throne; by his authority and assistance William was crowned on the day of the saints Cosmas and Damian, `[The 27th of September.]` and passed the remainder of the winter quietly and with general favour.

At the expiration of this period, in the beginning of spring, his first contention was with his uncle, Odo, bishop of Bayeux. For when Odo, on his release from confinement, as I have related, had firmly established his nephew, Robert, in the duchy of Normandy, he came to England, and received from the king the earldom of Kent. But when he saw every thing in the kingdom managed, not at his own pleasure, as formerly, for the administration of public affairs was now committed to William, bishop of Durham, he was moved with envy, and having revolted from the king, he tainted many others by insinuating, that the kingdom belonged to Robert, who was of gentler disposition, and whose youthful follies had been corrected by many adversities; that William, delicately brought up, and overbearing from that ferocity of mind which was manifest in his countenance, would dare every thing, in defiance of right and equity: that it must soon come to pass, that they would lose the honours they had already obtained with so much difficulty: that nothing was gained by the father's death, if those whom he had cast into prison, were to be killed by the son. To this effect he used, at first, secretly to mutter, together with Roger Montgomery, Gosfrith, bishop of Coutances, with his nephew Robert earl of Northumberland, and others; afterwards they were more open in their clamours, repeating and disseminating them by letters and by emissaries. Moreover, even William, bishop of Durham, the confidential minister of the king, had joined in their treachery. This was matter of great concern to William, it is said; because, together with the breach of friendship, he was disappointed of the resources of the distant provinces. Odo now carried off booty of every kind to Rochester, plundering the king's revenues in Kent, and especially the lands of the archbishop; breathing eternal hatred against him, because, he said, it was by his advice, that his brother had cast him into chains. Nor was this assertion false: for when William the elder formerly complained to Lanfranc, that he was deserted by his brother: "Seize, and cast him into chains," said he. "What!" replied the king, "he is a clergyman!" Then the archbishop with playful archness, as Persius says, "balancing the objection with nice antithesis," `[Persius, Sat. i. 85.]` rejoined, "you will not seize the bishop of Bayeux, but confine the earl of Kent."

Bishop Gosfrith with his nephew, depopulating Bath, and Berkeley, and part of the county of Wilts, treasured up their spoils at Bristol. Roger Montgomery sending out his army with the Welsh from Shrewsbury, plundered Worcestershire. They had now hostilely approached Worcester, when the king's soldiers who guarded it, relying on the blessing of bishop Wulstan, to whom the custody of the castle was committed, though few in number, dispersed this multitude; and after wounding and killing many, took some of them prisoners. Moreover, Roger Bigod at Norwich, and Hugo de Grentmeisnil at Leicester, each with their party, were plundering in their respective neighbourhoods. In vain, however, did the whole power of revolt rage against a man, who was deficient neither in prudence nor in good fortune. For seeing almost all the Normans leagued in one furious conspiracy, he sent alluring letters, summoning to him such brave and honest English as yet remained; and complaining to them on the subject of his wrongs, he bound them to his party, by promising them wholesome laws, a diminution of tribute, and free leave to hunt. `[On their own lands, it should seem from Sax. Chron., p. 465.]` With equal cunning he circumvented Roger Montgomery, when riding with him, with dissembled perfidy; for taking him aside, he loaded him with odium, saying, that he would willingly retire from the government, if it seemed meet to him and to the rest whom his father had left as his guardians; that he could not understand, why they were so outrageous; if they wanted money, they might have what they pleased; if an increase of their estates, they might have that also; in short, they might have whatever they chose; only let them be careful that the judgment of his father was not called in question: for, if they thought it ought to be disregarded in the instance of himself, it might be a bad example for them: for the same person made him king, who had made them earls. Excited by these words and promises, the earl, who, next to Odo, had been the chief leader of the faction, was the first to desert. Proceeding, therefore, immediately against the rebels, he laid siege to the castles of his uncle at Tunbridge and at Pevensey, and seizing him in the latter compelled him to swear, as he dictated, that he would depart England, and deliver up Rochester. To fulfil this promise he sent him forward with a party he could rely on, intending to follow at his leisure. At that time almost all the young nobility of England and Normandy were at Rochester: three sons of earl Roger, Eustace the younger of Boulogne, and many others not deserving notice. The royal party, accompanying the bishop, were few and unarmed, for who could fear treachery where he was present? and going round the walls, they called the townsmen to open the gates; for so the bishop in person, and the absent king commanded. Observing from the wall, however, that the countenance of the bishop ill agreed with the language of the speakers, they suddenly sallied out, took horse in an instant, and carried off, together with the bishop, the whole party, captive. The report of this transaction quickly reached the king. Fierce from the injury, and smothering his indignation, he calls together his faithful English subjects, and orders them to summon all their countrymen to the siege, unless any wished to be branded with the name of "Nidering," `[Nidering is supposed by Somner to denote such as were infamous enough to rifle a dead body. Gavelk. 65. Lye renders it, nequam, exlex, — infamous, outlaw. MS. Nithing. Spelman derives it from nidus : but there is no authority for either interpretation; and in such cases it is safer, to confess ignorance than to mislead the reader by fanciful etymologies.]` which implies "abandoned." The English who thought nothing more disgraceful than to be stigmatised by such an appellation, flocked in troops to the king, and rendered his army invincible. Nor could the townsmen longer delay submission; experiencing, that a party, however noble, or however numerous, could avail nothing against the king of England. Odo, now taken a second time, abjured England for ever: the bishop of Durham of his own accord retired beyond sea, the king allowing him to escape uninjured out of regard to his former friendship: the rest were all admitted to fealty. During the interval of this siege, some of the king's fleet destroyed a party which the earl of Normandy had sent to assist the traitors, partly by slaughter, and partly by shipwreck; the remainder, intent on escaping, endeavoured to make sail; but being soon after disappointed by its falling calm, they became matter for laughter to our people, but their own destruction; for, that they might not be taken alive, they leaped from their vessels into the sea.

TO DO

The troubles in Normandy, which might have been expected to produce an effect beneficial rather than otherwise upon the state of England, were followed by no such result. The Bastard had left behind him in the conquered kingdom representatives fully equal to himself in rapacity and cruelty; earls, viscounts, prelates, and abbots, who, hating the English because they had injured them, carried out the policy of the conquest with merciless rigour. Among these was Vaulcher, bishop of Durham, who also exercised the authority of a secular earl `[Simeon de Dunelmensi Ecclesia, p. 46]` and governor: he distinguished himself in both capacities, delivering homilies on morality in one breath, and with the next commanding plunder and homicide. This was what the Normans admired, and among them, therefore, Vaulcher the Lorrainer became the type of what a bishop should be. Vaulcher had naturally surrounded himself with creatures from his own country, to whom the plunder of the Northumbrians was at once a profitable and a pleasant pastime. Chief among these were Leobin and Gilbert, whose rapacity and cruelty, it is said, the bishop pardoned in consideration of their activity.

There was at that time in Durham a noble Saxon, Liwulf! by name, who having been stript by the Normans of all his possessions in the south of England, had fled northwards and taken refuge in the church of Durham. Popular superstition, on account of his blameless life and manners, attributed to him a supernatural intercourse with the great St. Cuthbert, who, it was affirmed, appeared to him familiarly, and dictated his decisions.' Jt is reasonable to assume that Liwulf displayed a strong partiality for his oppressed and injured countrymen, and thus rendered himself ‘an object of dislike to the foreign harpies who hovered over the bishop's table, and defiled everything they touched. Vaulcher himself beheld the Saxon with no friendly eye, though an attempt is made by some chroniclers to screen his memory. It appears certain that he lived on terms of great familiarity with Liwulf, frequently took his advice, and invited him to dine at his table. There, on one occasion, Leobin, dean of Durham, the bishop's chaplain, addressed the most opprobrious language to the Saxon, who, thrown off his guard by the priests's insolence, replied with great vehemence,

When the banquet broke up, Liwulf retired to hig own mansion, and Leobin to plot his destruction. He first applied to Gilbert, the bishop's kinsman, probably his son, whom he had put in authority over the whole county of Northumberland, and besought him to lend his aid in compassing the Englishman's overthrow. Gilbert, nothing lothe, fell into Leobin's views, and proceeding with a strong force to Liwulf's house, broke in and savagely murdered him and nearly all his family.* Vaulcher's authority in Durham was supreme, and therefore it rested entirely with him to free himself from suspicion, by punishing the murderers, or to make himself their accomplice, by con-

doning their guilt. He chose the latter course, thereby rendering it clear that.the crime had been perpetrated by his orders. He had not reckoned, however, upon the consequences of Liwulf's popularity; his noble deportment, his generosity, his piety, and - the -entire goodnéss of his life, had endeared him to the. Northumbrians, who, upen his assassination, rose in arms, and demanded the punishment of the malefactors, or, in default of this, expressed their determination to treat the bishop hiinself as an accomplice.

These conditions the bishop accepted, by retiring with the murderers into a church, and thence conveying offers to Liwulf's relatives and friends to pay the price of blood. The Northumbrians scorned these proposals, and demanded the death of the assassins. Vaulcher now drove Gilbert out of the church, and he was instantly slain by Liwulf's avengers. Leobin was next orderet to quit the sanctuary, but he refused, and Vaulcher found himself under the necessity of facing Liwulf's friends in person. Before the portal of the church they stood with drawn swords and spears, unable to look upon which, Vaulcher drew the skirts of his robe over his head, and, throwing himself forwards, was immediately pierced by the weapons of the Northumbrians, The cowardly caitiff, Leobin, trembling at the righteous vengeance of the people, still clung to the church, the wails and roof of which were then set on fire. Leobin continued in the, building till the scorching flames be-

1 Florence of Worcester, A.D.1080. There are many variations in the account of Vaulcher's death. The Saxon Chronicle, a.p. 1080, relates that he was slain in the month of May at a gemét, which does not here signify 2 regular assembly, but a tumultuous meeting or conference, held in front of the church at Gateshead, where, in the midst of their discussions, the Northumbrians shonted, "Schort réd, god

réd, slea ye the bischop!" Roger of Wendover, A.D. 1075, William of Malmesbury, ITI. p. 452, relates the story with an evident leaning to Vauicher, whom he absolves from all participation in the guilt of Liwuif's murder. With Vaulcher a hundred French and Flemings were massacred, from which it may be inferred that these foreigners had been employed in. vexing and pillaging the people.

came too fierce to* be endured. He then, half burnt, ascended to a lofty part of the edifice, and, casting himself down headlong, was dashed to pieces on the pavement. : ;

When the news of these events reached London, Odo, the sanguinary bishop of Bayeux, -son of Arlette and Herlouin, marched, with a powerful army, iito the North, to chastise the inhabitants, indiscriminately, for the act of a few individuals. Men who. were totally ignorant of the assassination of Vaulcher, who had probably never seen him or his victim, Liwulf, were now torn from their houses, and murdered or mutilated in a shocking manner.' Brother to the Bastard by birth, Odo was still more his brother by disposition—what William had spared during his expedition of vengeance, Odo now destroyed—with his resistless myrmidons at his heels, he swept over Northumbria like an iron tempest, devastating, plundering, murdering, apd leaving everywhere his track, marked by homesteads destroyed and towns reduced to a blackened heap of ruins. It was through admiration of these achievements that his countrymen bestowed upon him the name of "Tamer of the English."

In the conquered kingdom, Odo undoubtedly held the second place, having now been made carl of Kent . and Hereford, and grand justiciary of England. But the ambition of a priest always points towards Rome. Odo dreamed of the papacy, and aware of his desires, certain Italian soothsayers* confidently predicted that his head would one day be crowned with: the aifile mitre. Odo left no step untried to realise this prediction, but exhausted the revenues of England and Normandy in buying over the Roman cardinals and citizens, and in creating for himself a party among the general body of

order to dazzle the inhabitants of the Eternal City,

furnished and adorned it with the most lavish magnifi-

cence.'! The wallets of the pilgrims who traversed the

Alps were filled with letters and despatches to influential

ecclesiastics,' and everything appeared to be going on > well. .

Odo now projected an expedition in person to Rome, and secretly engaged a number of William's bravest knights to accompany him: they were on shipboard, and had actually set sail, when the king, who had received intelligence of theit design, came down upon them, took them all prisoners, and conveyed therh, for trial to the Isle of Wight. Here William assembled his barons, and overlooking the minor offenders, directed © his attack exclusively against his brother. He accused him of innumerable offences, of corrupting his knights and men-atearms, to gratify his ambition, of oppressing, England beyond measure, of pillaging churches and abbeys—in short, of every crime which could justify the king's severity against him.? He therefore ordered him to be seized, and conveyed as a prisonet to Normandy, : but no one would venture to lay his hands upon the formidable churchman, who stood there invested with all the mystic authority of the papacy. Perceiving the hesitation of his barons and knights, William himself advanced, and laid hold of Odo's robes, "I am a clerk," exclaimed Odo, "I am God's minister; none but the pope has aright to judge me." "I do not arrest the clerk," answered William, without relaxing his hold, "J arrest the earl of Kent, and my own justiciary, who has abused the privilege of his office, and thus rendered himself liable to-punishment." °

The knights who had been won over by Odo were pardoned by the king, but Odo himself was sent over to ~Normandy and confined in the castle of Rouen, where he remained a prisoner till his brother's death. To obtain the means of accomplishing his prodigious act of simony, Odo had practised every possible art of extorting money from the English people. He possessed a genius won. derfully adapted to the procuring of riches, and was a master of craft and dissimulation. When Odo himself ' had been imprisoned, William seized upon his partisans, and by threats, if not by torture, compelled them to reveal Odo's hoards, out of which were taken such piles of the precious metal as, according to the chronicler, would have exceeded the belief of succeeding ages.

The gold in some cases had bebn put into sacks, and .

sunk in rivers for the more complete concealnient of it;

but these treasures were now fished up, and served fo

enrich the conqueror. Odo's estates, consisting of four hundred and thirty-nine manors,' scattered over the most beautiful parts of England, were at the same time put under sequestration, if not entirely confiscated. The greed and rapacity of this churchman, in which he resembled most of the Norman nobility, stimulated him to seize upon lands and lordships* wherever he found it practicable to lay his hands on them, no matter whether they belonged to churches and monasteries or to private persons. He, doubtless, projected from the first the purchase of the papacy, which, as he knéw, had often: been put up for sale, and knocked down, like a bishopric or a common benefice, to the best bidder; and by thus rendering himself sovereign of the christian world, looked forward to the keen delight of wounding the

pride and trampling on the ambition of his brother, .

The mutual hatred of these sons of Arlette is one of the most unquestionable facts in history. That they cooperated against the English is admitted; but to this course they were incited, not by fraternal affection, but by self-interest. William knew that through Odo he could exert a powerful influence over the church, while' Odo clearly understood the advantages he should derive by contributing to..raise his brother to the throne of England. Their principle was that of brigands, settling by compact, beforehand, the amount of the plunder which each should receive from the fruits of the enterprise in- which they were-to engage. But their mutual hatred was not on this account -the less. Odo probably beheld. with disgust the seven hundred and ninety-three' manors bestowed on his stupid brother the carl. of Mortain," and endured, with fierce impatience, the superior wealth and authority of the king'; while William felt it necessary tobe always on his guard against Odo's" treachery, from' which he only then felt himself secure when he held him safe in the dungeons of Rouen castle, whence he was reluctant to ‘berate him, even at the point of death. cs

Some have conjectured that Wulfnoth,! the brother of Harold, may have passed the years of his captivity in the same fortress; this is uncertain; but the fate of the tyrannigat bishop was far more fortunate than that of the innocent hostage, who lived and died within the walls of a fortress.

During his absence the king had intrusted the reins of government to William Fitz-Osbern, and Odo, bishop of Bayeux. Odo was his uterine brother, the son of Herleva by her husband Herluin.2 The favour of William had promoted him at an early age to the see of Bayeux; and he soon displayed extraordinary abilities both in the administration of his diocese, and in the counsels of his sovereign. He possessed a splendid revenue, and spent it in beautifying his epis¬ copal city, and rewarding the services of his retainers.

In obedience to the canons he forbore to carry arms; but he constantly attended his brother in battle, and assisted with his advice in every military enterprise.

"He was," says a historian who had probably shared in his bounty, "a prelate of such rare and noble "qualities, that the English, barbarians as they "were, could not but love him and fear him." 3 On the other hand, we are assured by another well- informed and less partial writer, that his character was a compound of vice and virtue; and that, instead of attending to the duties of his station, he made riches and power the principal objects of his pursuit.4

WILLIAM I.
CHAP. VIII. A.D. 1067
To Odo had been assigned the government of Kent, the inhabitants of which, from their frequent intercourse with the continent, were deemed less savage than the generality of their countrymen.1 The remainder of the kingdom was committed to the vigilance of Fitz-Osbern, a Norman baron, related on the mother's side to the ducal family. William and he had grown up together from their infancy; and the attachment of their childish years had been afterwards strengthened by mutual services. In every civil com¬ motion Fitz-Osbern had supported his sovereign; to his influence was attributed the determination of William to invade England; and to the praise of consummate wisdom in the cabinet he added that of unrivalled courage in the field. He was considered the pride of the Normans and the scourge of the English.2

The previous merits of these ministers must be received on the word of their panegyrist; but their subsequent conduct does not appear to merit the confidence which was reposed in them by their sovereign; and to their arrogance and rapacity should be attri¬ buted the insurrections, forfeitures, and massacres, which so long afflicted this unhappy country, and which at last reduced the natives to a state of beggary and servitude. As soon as they entered on their high office, they departed from the system of conciliation which the king had adopted, and assumed the lofty mien and the arrogant manners of conquerors. The complaints of the injured were despised; aggression was encouraged by impunity; and the soldiers in the different garrisons insulted the persons, abused the

wives and daughters, and rioted at free quarters on the property of the natives.1 The refusal of redress awakened the indignation of the English; and in this moment of national effervescence, if an individual had come forward able to combine and direct the general hostility, the Norman ascendancy would probably have been suppressed. But the principal chieftains were absent; and the measures of the insurgents, without system or connection, were the mere result of sudden irritation, and better calculated for the purpose of present revenge than of permanent deliverance. Neither were the natives unanimous. Numbers at¬ tended more to the suggestions of selfishness than of patriotism: the archbishop of York and several of the prelates, many thanes, who had hitherto been undisturbed, and the inhabitants of most of the towns, whose prosperity depended on the public tranquillity, remained quiet spectators of the confusion around them. Some even lent their aid to put down the insurgents.2

p420-1

But Odo, so unworthy of the name of a Bishop, and Fitz-Osbern, were carried awav by excessive pride: all justice was entirely denied. All the wise coercion of evil, of needless crime, which had been enforced by William, was entirely thrown aside. William had caused peace to be observed and the dwellings to be protected: the Regents gave them up to robbery. William had ensured safe conduct to the wayfarer: the Regents gave up the highways to robbery and rapine. Above all, William had most carefully and inexorably protected the honour of the female: the Regents encouraged and supported their followers in sin and violence. It seemed as if the Normans, released from all authority, all restraint, all fear of retaliation, were now determined to reduce the English nation into bodily servitude, and to drive them to despair. This subversion of all discipline, this universal anarchy, was on the point of becoming fatal to the Norman power.

We possess very curious, and, it appears to me, conclusive evidence that William was kept in ignorance of these transactions, and that he was deceived by the reports transmitted to him by his brother and Fitz-Osbern. But, as throughout the whole of this stage of the conflict, the Normans were settled and confirmed in their authority, not so much by their own valour or their own prudence as by the moral visitation which had fallen upon the English. If the English could have been united under any one commander, or if they could have been united amongst themselves, they might yet have recovered their independence; but the spirit of the race was broken: emigration began. ...

p552-557

15. William must have quitted England (for he did now quit it for a short period) for the purpose of allowing his brother Odo to commit himself further in those designs which, however notorious, had not, as yet, acquired a sufficient degree of consistency to enable him to visit them with vengeance. Odo's plans had excited great apprehensions in William, and the more so from the mystery in which they were involved. He had, as before mentioned, been gathering together large forces, or rather seducing them from William's service, and more especially those on whom William had relied for the defence of the country against the Danes, whether of Ireland or of Scandinavia. Some say that Odo had been consulting whether his Holy Orders as a bishop would be an obstacle to his obtaining the royal authority, intimating his hope and expectation that he should yet live to be a king. Other projects, involving equal, perhaps greater, ambition, were attributed to him. Rome at this period was the seat of dark and mystic credulity. Amidst the monuments which testified the might of the great empire, strange superstitions were nourished, which the Church had no power to punish, though she might condemn. Here the sorcerer cast his lot, and the diviner worked his spell. Almost until our own times, a constant incentive to these endeavours has been found in the attempt to discover the prognostications declaring the name of future occupants of the Apostolic throne. The mystical distichs of Malachi of Armagh, the uncouth hieroglyphics of Abbot Joachim, the wheels and the circles, and the compound monsters, alluding to age, and name, and country, and device, have constantly been investigated by anxious credulity, and the frequent semblance of truth which these false prophecies have possessed, has en- couraged the confidence placed in the revelations proceeding from the source of all delusion. The many enemies of Hildebrand would anxi- ously resort to these predictions, and the rites of the magicians had received the answer that one whose name might be read as Odo, would come after Gregory as the successor of St. Peter.

The augury was widely spread, perhaps for the purpose of ensuring its accomplishment. Odo accepted it. Forthwith he despatched his trusty men to the insatiate capital of the Christian world. A sumptuous palace was purchased for him, and filled with the display of wealth and luxury. Gifts in profusion were bestowed upon the senators: every pilgrim who could be trusted bore an epistle with a due enclosure of coin, concealed in his wallet, ad- dressed to some needy Roman citizen, or needier noble, whose vote was thus to be secured; and the people, high and low, anticipated their approaching deliverance from Gregory's stern rectitude and rigid principle, and the advent of a more congenial sovereign. Such modes of courting the papacy were sufficiently common; but Odo, the Norman Odo, was preparing even to fight his way to the Quiriual, if it could not be won by gold. [For this] he had been raising those large forces which had excited William's anxiety. All had agreed to follow him into Italy, and were mustered in the south of England. Gregory was yet living. Was Odo preparing to eject him by violence? Without doubt, the Bishop of Bayeux participated in the vague delirium of adventurous conquest, which in one guise embodied itself in the approaching crusades. The passions of men, as well as their imaginative feelings, were at this era strangely combining for the same end. Had Odo succeeded, had the papal authority become vested in an active and experienced warrior, wielding at once the keys and the sword, another Julius, when the papal authority was in the fullest vigour, Europe might have sunk under a Latin caliphate.

Whatever may have been the enterprizes projected by Odo, William viewed them as fraught with great and impending danger. Odo had never shewn any want of fidelity towards his brother; but William's natural harshness was encreased by age, and still more by the repeated acts of opposition, treachery, and rebellion, which he had sustained. This harass of spirit had gone on encreasing since Waltheofs death: it seemed as if there were no one whom he could trust in the world. Odo had stationed himself in the Isle of Wight, preparing to cross over with his troops to Normandy, to Barfleur: here he was suddenly prevented by William, whose measures had been taken so secretly and so determinedly, as to be wholly unforeseen by him whose visions were to be at once irrevocably dispelled. Before the Proceres assembled in the royal hall, the King declared all the troubles he had received from kinsmen and from strangers, from son and from brother, from friend and from foe. It was an impassioned tale of the disappointments of ambition, so often felt and so seldom revealed: an outpouring of his bitter troubles. He charged Odo with mis-government, cruelty, treachery; and asked them for counsel how he should deal with this great state offender. All were silent: none ventured either to acquiesce in the charges brought against one still so powerful, yet less to contradict the angry, the implacable sovereign. William commanded that his brother should be arrested; yet no one dared to attempt to secure Odo's person. Whatever his conduct may have been, he was still a bishop: they shrunk back, fearing the censures of the Church, and thus their hands were stayed. William himself was compelled to seize the offender. "I am a clerk," exclaimed Odo, "and without the judgment of the apostolic see, I am not to be condemned." "Nay, I judge not the bishop," replied William, "but I arrest my accountant and my minister." Odo was shipped off to Normandy, and immured in the castle of Rouen, imprisoned and degraded, adding another to the long list of captives, who pined for the death of their oppressor or their own.

16. Matilda, whose strength had been rapidly declining, now rested from her sorrows, and was buried where her tomb is yet seen; in her own monastery of the Holy Trinity at Caen, between the altar and the choir. In the same manner as popular opinion had represented that William's rough courtship had won the young bride by force, now was it equally reported, but in a very different spirit, that the wife had died in consequence of the ill-treatment she received from her husband. In the strict sense of the word, the accusation is most improbable; but his great love for her did not prevent the heavy trials she sustained from his ungovernable violence and wrath, and these probably shortened her mortal existence. The gloom thickened round him: it seemed as if all his good fortune had finally departed. Anxieties and troubles continued encreasing upon him, and after he had lost Matilda, he never, as it were, looked up again.


p584
But Rufus and Henry are standing by that bedside, and who is to be the Conqueror's heir? How are his dominions to be divided? William must speak of his earthly authority; but every word relating to the object of his pride is uttered in agony. Robert, as first-born, is to take Normandy: it was granted to him before William met Harold in the field of the valley of blood. "Wretched," declared the King, "will be the country subjected to his rule; but he has received the homage of the barons, and the concession, once made, cannot be withdrawn. Of England, I will appoint no heir: let Him in whose hands are all things, provide according to His will." All the wide wasting wretchedness produced by his ambition rose up before him: it seemed as if the air around him was filled with the waitings of those who had perished at his behest, by the sword, by famine, and by fire. Bitterly lamenting his anger, his harshness, his crimes, he declared that he dared not bestow the realm he thus had won: and yet this reserve was almost a delusion: the natural feeling of a father prevailed, and he declared his hope that Rufus, who from youth upwards, whatever were his other defects of character, had been an obedient son, might succeed him. And what was Henry Beauclerc to inherit? A treasure of five thousand pounds of silver. Henry began to lament this unequal gift. "What will all this treasure profit me," exclaimed he, "if I have neither land, nor house, nor home?" William comforted his youngest son, and that strangely, by intimating his foreboding that Henry, becoming far greater than either brother, would one day possess far greater and ampler power.

But the very words which William had spoken, now excited his own apprehensions: the intimations he had thus given, might, by implying a doubt of his right to confer the succession, instigate rebellion. He turned him round in his weary bed, and directed that a writ should be prepared, addressed to Lanfranc, commanding him to place Rufus on the throne; and the dying man, he who had just vowed that he would not take thought concerning the sinful inheritance, affixed his royal signet to the instrument by which, in fact, he bequeathed the unlawful gain; and he forthwith delivered the same to Rufus, kissed him, and blessed him; and Rufus hastened away towards England, lest he should lose the blood-stained crown. Henry, too, departed, to secure his legacy, and to consider how he should best protect himself against the troubles which he might occasion or sustain.

6. Both sons have now left their dying parent. More suspense, more agony. Those who surrounded him had heard of alms and of repentance, of contrition and of distribution of the wealth no longer his own. Some portions to make amends for the wrongs he had committed, some to the poor; the ample residue to his sons. But as yet no real charity; of forgiveness, nothing had been said by William, nothing of remission to the captives in the dungeon, upon whom the doom of perpetual imprisonment had been past. William assented to the remark, and yet justified himself for his severity. Morcar had been hardly treated, and yet how could he, William, restrain the fear which he had felt of his influence? Roger de Breteuil had shewn a fell revenge, yet let them be freed; Woolnoth, the brother of Harold, a child when he fell into the hands of the Conqueror, who had sternly kept him in bonds since the days of his infancy, and Siward of the North, were to be released; and William ended by commanding that all the prison doors in England and Normandy should be opened, except to one alone: except to Odo his brother. Much were those about William saddened by this hardness: many arid urgent were the entreaties made, but above all by the third brother, Robert of Mortaigne. At length William relaxed his severity, but without relenting, declaring his unchange- able conviction of Odo's perfidy, and that he yielded against his will.

This act of grudging, coerced, extorted forgiveness was his last. A night of somewhat diminished suffering ensued, when the troubled and expiring body takes a dull, painful, unrestful rest before its last earthly repose. But as the cheerful, life-giving rays of the rising sun were darting above the horizon, across the sad apartment, and shedding brightness on its walls, William was half awakened from his imperfect slumbers by the measured, mellow, reverberating swelling tone of the great cathedral bell. "It is the hour of prime," replied the attendants in answer to his enquiry. Then were the priesthood welcoming with voices of thanksgiving the renewed gift of another day, and sending forth the choral prayer, that the hours might flow in holiness till blessed at their close:

"Now that the sun is gleaming bright,  
Implore we, bending low,  
That He, the uncreated light,  
May guide us as we go.

"No sinful word, nor deed of wrong,  
Nor thoughts that idly rove,  
But simple truth be on our tongue,  
And in our hearts be love.

"And while the hours in order flow,  
O Christ, securely fence  
Our gates, beleaguered by the foe,  
The gate of every sense.

"And grant that to thine honour, Lord,  
Our daily toil may tend;  
That we begin it at Thy word,  
And in Thy favour end."

But his time of labour and struggle, sin and repentance was past. William lifted up his hands in prayer and expired.

How King Rufus overcame his Opponent.

306. At the expiration of this period, in the beginning of spring `[The conHpiracy was formed in Lent; and as soon as Easter came, then went they forth. See the Sax. Chron. a. d. 1088.]` his first contention was with his uncle, Odo, bishop of Baieux. For when he, on his release from confinement, as I have related, had firmly established his nephew, Robert, in the duchy of Normandy, he came to England, and received from the king the earldom of Kent. `[Odo waa created earl of Kent, a.d. lOGT.]` But when he saw everything in the kingdom managed, not at his own pleasure, as formerly, (for the administration of public affairs was now committed to William, `[William de S. Carileph.]` bishop of Durham.) moved with envy, he himself revolted from the king, and tainted many others by insinuating that the kingdom belonged to Robert, who was of gentler disposition, and whose youthful follies had been corrected by many adversities; that William, delicately brought up, and overbearing from that ferocity of mind which was manifest in his countenance, would dare everything, in defiance of right and equity; that it must soon come to pass, that they would lose the honours they had already obtained with so much difficulty; that nothing was gained by the father's death, if those whom he had cast into prison were to be killed by the son. To this effect he used, at first, secretly to whisper, together with Roger Montgomery, Geoffrey, his bishnp of Coutances, `[Geoffrey de Montbray became bishop of Coutauce in 1048. He was chief justiciary of England, and presided at the great trial in the county court held at Pinendene in Keot, botween Lanfrank, archbishop of Canterbury, and Odo, biaiiop of Baieux. He died 4th of February, 1093. In Domesday Book he is deeeribed as "Constantientis episcopus;" but in one place (fol. 165) he is called "Episcopus de Sancto Laudo" (St. Lo, a town in Lower Normandy), and, among the witnesses to a chartor granted by the Conqueror to St Aqgustine's monastery at Canterbury, is "Episcopus Galfrydus de Seynt Loth."]` with his nephew Robert earl of Northumberland and others; afterwards they were more open in their clanours, repeating and disseminating them by letters and by emissaries. Moreover, even William bishop of Durham, the confidential minister of the king, had joined in their treachery; which was a matter of great concern to William, it is said; because, together with the breach of friendship, he was disappointed of the resources of the distant provinces. Odo now carried off booty of every kind to Rochester, plundering the king's revenues in Kent, and especially the lands of the archbishop; breathing eternal hatred against him, because, he said, it was by his advice that his brother had cast him into chains. Nor was this assertion false; for when William the Elder formerly complained to Lanfranc, that he was deserted by his brother; "Seize, and cast him into chains." said he. "What!" replied the king, "he is a clergyman." Then the archbishop with playful archness, as Persius says, `[Feruufl!, Sat. i. 85.]` balancing the objection with nice antithesis," rejoined, "you will not seize the bishop of Baieux, but confine the earl of Kent." Bishop Geoffry with his nephew, depopulating Bath and Berkeley, and part of the county of Wilts, treasured up their spoils at Bristol. Roger Montgomery sending out his army with the Welsh from Shrewsbury, plundered Worcestenhlre; and then attacked Worcester, when the king's soldiers who guarded it, though few in number, relying on the blessing of bishop Wulstan, to whom custody of the castle was committed. dispersed this multitude; and after wounding and killing many, took some of them prisoners. Moreover, Roger Bigot at Norwich, and Hugo de Grentemesnil at Leicester, each with their party, were plundering in their respective neighbourhoods. In vain, however, did the whole power of revolt against a man, who was deficient neither in prudence nor in good fortune. For seeing almost all the Normans leagued in one furious conspiracy, he sent persuasive letters, summoning to him such brave and honest English as yet remained; and complaining to them on the subject of his wrongs, he bound them to his party, by promising them wholesome laws, a diminution of tribute, and free leave to hunt. `[On tbcir own lands, it should seem, from the statement of the Sax. Chron.]` ...
