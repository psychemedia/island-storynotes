# Rules of the Sea and the Shore

One of the defining features of any state is the definition and the extent of its laws. We might think of these as having either negotiated or natural borders, which for an island nation we might naturally consider to be the shoreline. But what of the jurisdiction of the sea? And what of goods or wrecks that pass from the sea to the shore?

## Rules of the Sea

In the reign of King Richard I, a convention going by the name of the *Laes of Oleron* was adopted by the north-western European nations and states that provided a *de facto* law of the sea.

CHAP. XII.

*A summary of the sea Laws of Oleron, made by King Richard I. with some Notice of the sea Laws of Rhodes, Wisbuy, &c. relating to Merchants, Masters of ships, and Mariners.*

KING Richard the Firſt of England, in his Return from the Holy Land, arriving at the Iſle of Oleron, ſituate in the Bay of Acquittain, of which that Prince was then in Poſſeſſion, did there make and publiſh certain Laws and Statutes for the Regulation of Maritime Affairs, which were for many Ages famous under the Title of the *Laws of Oleron*: And theſe Laws, tho' they were publiſh'd there, did not only take Place in that Iſland, and the adjacent Countries, but likewiſe in all the Seas and Maritime Places in this Part of the World. For it hath been obſerv'd, that as ſoon as they came to be known, they were approv'd by all honeſt Men, who us'd the Sea: And according to the Nature of ancient Cuſtoms, they inſinuated themſelves by Degrees, and got Footing in Courts of Law and Juſtice. They agree with, in many Things, the ancient Laws of *Rhodes*, a City in a renown'd Iſland of that Name in the Mediterranean Sea: And upon the Foundation of the Laws of *Oleron*, are built the Ordinances of the famous City of *Wisbuy* in the Iſle of *Gothland*; which were in Force in all Ports, Harbours, and Seas of *Europe*, as far as the Streights of *Gibraltar*.

Tho' in ſome Parts of this Treatiſe, there are ſome Caſes from, and References to, the Laws of *Oleron*, eſpecially under the Heads of Maſters and Owners of Ships, &c. Yet it hath been thought neceſſary to inſert the following Summary of them; that the Reader may have a compleat View of theſe great and excellent Laws all together, for his further Uſe and Satisfaction.

```

The laws provide a complete code of conduct regulating the behaviour or merchants, masters and seamen, how they should treat one another and how they should be treated by others. They also describe what constitutes a ship*wreck*, and how goods that then make there way to shore should be regarded.

In *Lex mercatoria, Chapter XI.*

Article XXIX

If any Ship or Veſſel ſailing to and fro, and coaſting the Seas, as well in the Way of Merchandiſing, as on the fiſhing Account, happen by Miſfortune, through the Badneſs of the Weather to ſtrike againſt any Rocks, whereby ſhe becomes ſo bruiſed and broken, that there ſhe periſheth upon that Coaſt or Country, and the Maſter, Mariners, Merchants, or any of thoſe eſcape and come ſafe to Land; in this Caſe, the Lords of that Place or Country, where ſuch Misfortune ſhall happen, ought not to let, hinder, or oppoſe ſuch as have ſo eſcaped, or ſuch to whom the ſaid Ship or Veſſel and her Lading belong, in uſing their utmoſt Endeavours for the Preſervation of as much thereof as may poſſibly be ſaved. But on the contrary, the Lord of that Place or Country, by his own Intereſt, and thoſe under his Power, ought to be aiding and aſſiſting to the diſtreſs'd Mariners or Merchants, in ſaving their ſhipwreck'd Goods, and that without any the leaſt Imbezilment, or Taking any Part thereof from the right Owners; though there may be a Conſideration for Salvage to ſuch as take Pains therein, according to right Reaſon, good Conſcience, and as Juſtice ſhall appoint. And in caſe any ſhall act contrary hereunto, or take ny Part of the ſaid Goods from the ſaid diſtreſs'd, ruin'd, and undone ſhipwreck'd Perſons, againſt their Wills, they ſhall be declar'd to be excommunicated, and receive the Puniſhment of Thieves, unleſs ſpeedy Reſtitution be made by them. Nor is there any Cuſtom or Statute that can protect them apainſt the Penalties in the 26th Article of the Laws.

Article XXXI

If a Ship or Veſſel happens to be loſt by ſtriking on the Shore, and the Mariners, thinking to fave their Lives, reach the Shore in Hopes of Help, and inſtead thereof it happens, as it often doth, that in many Places they meet with People fo very Barbarous, Cruel, and Inhumane, that, to gain their Money, Apparel, and other Goods, they Murder and Deſtroy the poor diſtreſs'd Seamen feeking their Help; in this Caſe, the Lord of that Country ought to execute ſevere Juſtice on ſuch Wretches, and to plunge them in the Sea till the be half Dead, and then to have them drawn forth out of the Sea, and ſton'd to Death.

Article XLVI

If any Ship, or other Veſſel, by any Caſual or Misfortune, happens to be wreck'd and periſh, the Pieces of the Bulk of the Veſſel, as well as the Lading thereof, ought to be preſerv'd and kept in Safety for them to whom it belong'd before ſuch Diſaſter happen'd, notwithſtanding any Cuſtom to the contrary. And all Takers, Partakers, or Conſenters of or to the ſaid Wreck, if they be Clergymen, ſhall be depoſed and deprived of their Benefices; and if Laymen, they ſhall incur the Penalties aforeſaid, in the 25th, 26th, and 29th Articles.

```

There was also a disclaimer:

> Article XLVII
>
> This is to be underſtood only when the Ship or Veſſel ſo wreck'd, did not exerciſe the Trade of Pillaging, and when the Mariners thereof were not Pirates, Sea-Rovers, or Enemies to our Holy Catholick Faith; for if they are found either the one or the other, any Man may deal with them as with Rogues, and deſpoil them of their Goods, without any Puniſhment for ſo doing.

So what were those penalties described in articles 25, 26, and 29, and to what did they apply?

Article XXV.

If a Ship or Veſſel arriving at any Place, and making in towards a Port or Harbour, ſet out her Flag, or give any other Sign to have a Pilot come aboard, or a Boat to tow her into the Harbour, the Wind or Tide being contrary, and Contract be made for Piloting the Veſſel into the Harbour accordingly; but becauſe of an unreaſonable and accurſed Cuſtom in ſome Places, that the third or fourth Part of the Ships that are loſt, ſhall accrue to the Lord of the Place where ſuch ſad Caſualties happen, as alſo the like Proportion to the Salvers, and only the Remainder to the Maſter, Merchant, and Mariners; the Perſons contracting for the Pilotage of the ſaid Veſſel, to ingratiate themſelves with their Lords, and to gain to themſelves a Part of the Ship and Lading, do like faithleſs and treacherous Villains, ſometimes even willingly and out of Deſign to ruin Ship and Goods, guide and bring her upon the Rocks; and then feigning to aid and aſſiſt the diſtreſs'd Mariners, are the firſt in diſmembring and pulling the Ship 'to Pieces, purloining and carrying away the Lading thereof, contrary to all Reaſon and good Conſcience; and afterwards that they may be the more Welcome to their Lords, do with all Speed poſt to his Houſe with this ſad Narrative of this unhappy Diſaſter, whereupon the ſaid Lord, with his Retinue, appearing at the Place, take their Share, the Salvers theirs, and what remains the Merchant and Mariners may have, Now ſeeing all this is contrary to the Law of God, our Edict is, notwithſtanding any Law or Cuſtom to the contrary, and it is hereby ordain'd, that the ſaid Lord of the Place and Salvers, and all others that take away any of the ſaid Goods, ſhall be accurſed and excommunicated, and puniſhed as Thieves and Robbers. But all falſe and treacherous Pilots ſhall be condemn'd to ſuffer a moſt e and unmerciful Death; and high Gibbets ſhall be erected for them in the ſame Place, or as near as may be, where they ſo guided and brought any Ship or Veſſel to Ruin as aforeſaid, and thereon theſe accurſed Pilots are with much Shame and Ignomy to end their Days ; which Gibbets are to abide and remain to ſucceeding Ages on that Place, as a viſible Caution to other Ships that ſhall afterwards ſail thereby.

Article XXVI.

And if the Lord of any Place be ſo Barbarous, as not only to permit ſuch inhumane People, but alſo to maintain and aſſiſt them in ſuch Villanies, that he may have a Share in ſuch Wrecks, the ſaid Lord ſhall be apprehended, and all his Goods confiſcate and Sold, in order to make Reſtitution to ſuch as of Right it appertaineth; and himſelf ſhall be faſtened to a Poſt or Stake, in the Midſt of his own Manſion-houſe, which being fir'd at the four Corners, all ſhall be burnt together, the Walls thereof ſhall be demoliſh'd, the Stones pull'd down, and the Place converted into a Market-Place, for the Sale only of Hogs and Swine to all Poſterity.

Article XXIX.

If any Ship or Veſſel ſailing to and fro, and coaſting the Seas, as well in the Way of Merchandiſing, as on the fiſhing Account, happen by Miſfortune, through the Badneſs of the Weather to ſtrike againſt any Rocks, whereby ſhe becomes ſo bruiſed and broken, that there ſhe periſheth upon that Coaſt or Country, and the Maſter, Mariners, Merchants, or any of thoſe eſcape and come ſafe to Land; in this Caſe, the Lords of that Place or Country, where ſuch Misfortune ſhall happen, ought not to let, hinder, or oppoſe ſuch as have ſo eſcaped, or ſuch to whom the ſaid Ship or Veſſel and her Lading belong, in uſing their utmoſt Endeavours for the Preſervation of as much thereof as may poſſibly be ſaved. But on the contrary, the Lord of that Place or Country, by his own Intereſt, and thoſe under his Power, ought to be aiding and aſſiſting to the diſtreſs'd Mariners or Merchants, in ſaving their ſhipwreck'd Goods, and that without any the leaſt Imbezilment, or Taking any Part thereof from the right Owners; though there may be a Conſideration for Salvage to ſuch as take Pains therein, according to right Reaſon, good Conſcience, and as Juſtice ſhall appoint. And in caſe any ſhall act contrary hereunto, or take ny Part of the ſaid Goods from the ſaid diſtreſs'd, ruin'd, and undone ſhipwreck'd Perſons, againſt their Wills, they ſhall be declar'd to be excommunicated, and receive the Puniſhment of Thieves, unleſs ſpeedy Reſtitution be made by them. Nor is there any Cuſtom or Statute that can protect them apainſt the Penalties in the 26th Article of the Laws.

```

The rules of Oleron also considered cases of what would later come to be called *flotsam* and *jetsam*.

Article VIII

If a Veſſel laden fail from any Port or Place, and it happens that a Storm overtakes her at Sea, ſo violent that ſhe cannot eſcape without caſting ſome of the Cargo over-board, for Lightning the Veſſel, and Preſerving the reſt of the Lading, as well as the Veſſel it ſelf; then the Maſter ought to conſult the Merchants on Board; or if there be na Merchants, or if thoſe that are there, approve of it by their Silence, then the Maſter may do as he thinks fit: And if the Merchants are not pleas'd with his Throwing over any Part of the Merchandize, and forbid him; yet the Maſter ought not ta forbear caſting out ſo many of the Goods, as he ſhall ſee to be for the common Good and Safety ; he and the third Part of his Mariners making Oath, when they arrive at their Port of Diſcharge, that he did it only for the Preſervation of the Ship, and the Reſt of the Lading. And the Wines, or other Goods caſt over Board, ought to be valu'd according to the juſt Value of the other Goods that arrive in Safety: And when theſe ſhall be ſold, the Price or Value thereof ought to be divided among the Merchants: And the Maſter may compute the Damage his Veſſel hath ſuſtain'd; or reckon the Freight of the Goods thrown over Board at his own Choice: The Mariners alſo ought to have one Tun free, and another divided by Caſt of the Dice, according as it ſhall happen. But if the Maſter doth not make it appear, that he and his Men did the Part of able Seamen, then neither he nor they ſhall have any Thing: And the Merchants, in this Caſe, may lawfully put the Maſter to his Oath.

Article XXXII

If by Reaſon of tempeſtuous Weather, it be thought expedient, for the lightning of any Ship at Sea, or riding at Anchor in any Road, to caſt Part of the Lading over-board, and it be done accordingly, for the common Safety, though the ſaid Goods fo ejected do become his that can firſt poſſeſs himſelf thereof and carry them away; nevertheleſs it is further to be underſtood, that this holds true only in ſuch Caſes, as when the Maſter, Merchant, and Mariners, have caſt out the ſaid Goods, ſo that they give over all Hope or Deſire of ever recovering them again, and leave them as Things utterly loſt and given over, without ever making any Enquiry or Purſuit after them. In which Caſe, and no other, the firſt Occupant beTomes the lawful Proprietor thereof.

Article XXXIII

If a Ship, or other Veſſel, hath caſt over-board ſeveral Goods or Merchandiſes, which are in Cheſts well lock'd and made faſt, or Books well claſp'd and ſhut cloſe, that they may not be damnified by Salt Water: In ſuch Caſes, it is to be preſum'd, that they who did caſt ſuch Goods over-board, do ſtill retain an Intention, Hope, and Deſire of recovering the ſame; for which Reaſon, thoſe Perſons as happen to find ſuch Things, are oblig'd to make Reſtitution thereof to him who hath a Right to and ſhall make due Enquiry after them, or put them to pious Uſes,

Article XLIII

In all Things found by the Sea Side, which have formerly been in the Poſſeſſion of ſome or other, as Wine, and other Merchandiſe, although they have been caſt over-board, and left by the Merchants, and ſo ought to appertain to him that firſt finds the ſame; yet herein alſo the Cuſtom of the Country is to be obſerved: But if there be a Preſumption that theſe were the Goods of ſome Ship that periſh'd, then neither the ſaid Lord, nor Finder thereof, ſhall take or convert any Part of it to their own Uſe; but as hath been ſaid, diſtribute the Money it produces to the Poor

As far as legal precedent in the Middle Ages goes, in a compilation dated 1650, many years after his death, Coke cites the case of *Sir Henry Constable* when it comes to the legal definition of *flotsam* and *jetsam*, as well as a third category of goods, *lagan*.

## Concerning Wrecks of the Sea, 1275

In the early 1300s, the law of the land concerning *"wrecks of the sea"* that was extant at the time was a regulation passed in 1275, the third year of the reign of Edward I:

> IV. CONCERNING Wrecks of the Sea, it is agreed, That where a Man, a Dog, or a Cat escape quick out of the ship, that such Ship nor Barge, nor any thing within them, shall be adjudged Wreck; but the Goods shall be saved and kept by view of the sheriff, Coroner, or the King's Bailiff, and delivered into the hands of such as are of the Town where the Goods were found; so that if any sue for those Goods, and after prove `[can prove]` that they were his, `[or his Lord's]` or perished in his keeping, within a Year and a Day, they shall be restored to him without delay; and if not, they shall remain to the King, and be seised by the sheriffs, Coroners, and Bailiffs `[Sheriff and Coroner]`, and shall be delivered to them of the Town, which shall answer before the Justices of the Wreck belonging to the King; And where Wreck belongeth to another than to the King, he shall have it in like manner. And he that otherwise doth, and thereof be attainted, shall be awarded to Prison, and make Fine at the King's Will, and shall yield Damages also. And if a Bailiff do it and it be disallowed by the Lord, `[and be disavowed of his Lord]` and the Lord will not pretend any Title thereunto, `[will not discharge him thereof]` the Bailiff shall answer, if he have whereof; and if he have not whereof, the Lord shall deliver his Bailiff's Body to the King.

In Giles Jacob, *Lex mercatoria: or, the merchant's companion. Containing all the laws and statutes relating to merchandize*, 2nd edition, 1729, [p. 145-151](https://archive.org/details/bim_eighteenth-century_lex-mercatoria-or-the-_jacob-giles_1729/page/144/mode/2up).

CHAP. V.

Of Wrecks, in whom the Property is vested by the Civil Law; Of the King's Prerogative in Relation to Wrecks; And of the Admiralty; Of Flotsam, Jetsam, and Lagan, &c.

IN ancient Times, all Wrecks belong'd to the Crown; but by stat. 3 Ed. I. it is ordained, that when either a Man, a Dog, or a Cat, or any Thing escapes alive out of the ship, there shall be no Wreck, but the same shall be kept a Year and a Day by the sheriff, to be restored to any Person that can prove a Property in the Goods within that Time; and if no Body comes, then the same is to be forfeited to the King, or rather the Lord High Admiral, to whom they are granted by Patent.

But it was usual to seize Wrecks as forfeited to the King, only when no Owner could be found; for the Property being in that Case in no Man, it must of Consequence belong to the King, as Lord of the narrow seas, which he is obliged to scower of Pyrates, &c. and the Product of Wrecks was ordained to contribute to the Charge. And *Bracton* says, there shall be no Wreck where the Owner comes and makes Claim to the Goods, without Limitation of Time.

If a ship be ready to sink, and all the Men therein, for the Preservation of their Lives, quit the ship, and afterwards she perishes; if any of the Men are saved, and come to Land, the Goods are not lost.

A ship on the sea was chased by an Enemy; the Men therein, for the security of their Lives, quitted the Ship; the Enemy took the Ship, and spoil'd her of her Goods and Tackle, and turned her to sea; by stress of Weather she is cast on Land, where it happen'd her Men safely arriv'd. It was resolved, that the ship was no Wreck. 5 R. 2. Fishlake's Case. Co. 2. Inst. fol. 167.

Where a Wreck happens by any Fault or Negligence in the Master or Mariners, the Master must make Good the Loss; but if the same was occasioned by the Act of God, or done to avoid an Enemy, or Pyrate, &c. there he shall be excus'd. And if the Master, or any of the Mariners lie ashore, and the ship during their Absence, perisheth, whether by Night or by Day, the Master or Mariners, so lying ashore, shall sustain the Damage; and those who remain'd in the ship, shall be excused. Leg. Rhod.

If a ship and Goods perish in the sea, and the Owners abandon her, so that she becomes a mere Derelict; in such Case, the first Person that takes Possession of her, and recovers any Part of the Lading, gains a Property by the Laws of Nations. And if a ship perishes only, and the Goods are safe; in that Case, by the *Rhodian* Law, the Goods ought to pay a Proportion of a fifth or tenth Penny, according to the Difficulty in saving the Goods; (wherein rich Goods, such as Gold and silver, silk, &c. pay less than Goods of great Weight and Cumber, they being in less Danger) for the salvage.

Owners claiming a Wreck, must make sufficient Proof of their Title within the Year and Day; and they are to do it by their Marks or Cocquets, by the Book of Customs, or the Testimony of reputable Men; and if the Wreck be taken by the King, the Party may sue out a Commission to hear and determine by the Oaths of twelve Men; or he may bring his Action at Law. F. N. B. Fol. 12.

When Goods wreck'd are perishable, the sheriff may sell them within the Year and Day, and the sale shall be good; but he must dispose of them for the best Advantage, and account with the Owners. And by the Laws of France, all ships and Persons belonging to them, that shall be cast ashore by Tempest, or otherwise, upon the Coasts of that Kingdom, and every Thing that has escap'd shipwreck, is declared to be taken into the Protection of the King.

By the Civil Law, if any Person steal shipwreck'd Goods, they shall pay four-fold to the Owner, if pursued within a Year and a Day, and as much to the Prince, or his Admiral; and so careful is this Law in requiring Restitution, that the very stealing of a Nail, or the Worth thereof, oblig'd the Thief to the Restitution of all the remaining Goods. And by the Emperor Antonius was made a Law, That such Criminals should be banish'd for three Years, if they were of high Rank; and those that were base and ignoble, were to be scourged and sent to the Gallies. By the same Law, if any Man should prevent Assistance to shipwreck'd Persons, he was to be punish'd as a Murderer; and the like Punishment was ordain'd for those who should, by Treachery, put forth any Lanthorn or Light, with Intention to subject them to Danger or shipwreck. Hence it is that Fishers are forbidden to fish with Lights in the Night.

If Goods are wreck'd on shore, and the Lord, having Power, takes them, he shall not pay Custom, neither by the Common Law, nor by the statute Law; for at the Common Law, wreck'd Goods could not be charg'd with Custom, by Reason the Wreck is wholly the King's, and he could not have a Custom out of what was all his own. Stat. West. 1. Shep versus Gosnold. Hill. 23 & 24 Car. 2. Rot. 615.

And Wines or other Goods, coming or brought into the Kingdom by Wreck, are not imported by any Body, but by the Wind and sea; for such Goods are destitute of a Proprietor, until the Law appoints one: And wreck'd Goods are not brought into the Kingdom, (being cast ashore) as Merchandise for sale. Goods drown'd, or lost in passing a Ferry, a great River, or Arm of the sea, are not to be said exported, although they be carried to sea.

By stat. 12 Annae c. 18. it is enacted, That sheriffs, Justices of Peace, Head Officers of Towns, &c. and Officers of the Customs, in all Places where a ship shall be in Danger of being stranded, or run on shore, upon Application to them made on Behalf of the Commander of the ship, shall command the Constables to assemble as many Men as shall be necessary for the Preservation of the ship. And if there be any ships of War lying at Anchor near the Place, then the Officers of such ships are to send forth their Boats, and as many Men as they can spare, to her Assistance, under the Penalty of 100*l.* to be recover'd by the Officer of the ship in Distress.

When a ship is preserv'd by these Means, the Persons who assisted therein, shall, within thirty Days after, be paid a reasonable Reward for the same, by the Officer of the ship, or Merchant; and in Default thereof, the ship or Goods shall remain in the Custody of the Officers of the Customs, as a security.

Persons entering such ship in Distress, without Leave from the Commander, Constable, &c. or molesting any one in the salvage, shall make double satisfaction within twenty Days. And if any Goods are carried off from such ship, and found on any Person, if they are not delivered to the Owner on Demand, such Person shall be liable to pay treble the Value of the Goods.

If any Officer of the Customs, or his Deputy, abuse the Trust reposed in him, and shall be convicted thereof, he shall forfeit treble Damages to the Party grieved, and be incapable of any Employment in the Customs.

And by this statute to make a Hole in the Bottom, side, or in any Part of the ship; or do any Thing tending to the Loss of the ship, is made Felony, without the Benefit of Clergy.

This Act is not to extend to deprive the Crown, or any Grantee, of any Right or Claim to any Wreck or Goods that shall be *Jetsam*, *Flotsam*, or *Lagan*.

*Flotsam, Jetsam, &c.*

*Flotsam*, *Jetsam*, and *Lagan*, are Goods on or in the sea, and belong to the King or Lord Admiral,

*Flotsam* is when a ship is sunk or cast away, and the Goods float upon the sea.

*Jetsam* is where the ship is in Danger of sinking, and the Goods are cast into the sea for the lightening of the ship, and notwithstanding the ship perisheth.

*Lagan* is when heavy Goods are cast into the sea before the Perishing of the ship; and being sunk, the Master or Mariners fasten a Buoy, or other sea-Mark, to them, whereby they may more easily be directed to the Place where they lie.

The King shall have *Flotsam*, *Jetsam*, and *Lagan*, when the ship perisheth, or when the Owners of the Goods are not known, but not otherwise. F. N. B. 122.

A Man may have *Flotsam* and *Jetsam* by the King's Grant; and may have *Lagan* within the high and low Water-Mark by Prescription, as it appears in the *West*-Country, where the Lords of Manors prescribe to have Wreck in the sea, so far as they can see a Humber-Barrel.

*Wreccum Maris* are such Goods only as are cast and left upon the Land by the sea.

By the Grant of Wreck will pass *Flotsam*, *Jetsam*, and *Lagan*, when they are cast upon the Land; but if they are not cast upon the Land, the Admiral hath Jurisdiction, and not the Common Law, and they cannot be said to be Wreck.

King Edward the second, in the first Year of his Reign, granted by Charter the Castle of *Carisbrook*, with all the Lands and Tenements, in the Isle of *Wight*, then formerly belonging to the Countess of *Albemarle*, to his Favourite *Peter de Gaveston* and *Margaret* his Wife, and the Heirs of their two Bodies begotten, with several other Castles and Lands; but they being soon after reseized into the King's Lands, he granted this Castle, with all its services, and all his Lands in that Isle, to *Edward* his son, and his Heirs, Kings of *England*; and afterwards, for the ascertaining what did of Right belong to the same Castle, a Writ of Inquisition was issued out, by which it was found *inter alia, quod wreccum Maris, pertinens ad dictum Castrum*, &c.

So that without special Words in the Patent granted to the Lord High Admiral, the Wreck of this Isle will not pass.

*An Affidavit that a ship is cast away.*

Thomas Mortimer's *A new and complete dictionary of trade and commerce* of 1766 provides a similar description:

```{admonition} Flotsam, Jetsam, Lagan and Wreck
:class: dropdown
In Thomas Mortimer, *A new and complete dictionary of trade and commerce: containing a distinct explanation of the general principles of commerce; an accurate definition of its terms*, 1766.

[FLOTSAM](https://archive.org/details/newcompletedicti02mort/mode/2up), JESTSAM, LAGAN, and WRECK. Theſe terms are generally defined together.

*Flotſam*, is when a ſhip is ſunk, or otherwiſe periſhed, and the goods float upon the ſea.

*Jetſam*, is when a ſhip is in danger of being loſt, and, in order to ſave by lightening her, ſome goods are caſt into the ſea, notwithstanding which she afterwards periſhes.

*Lagan*, or *ligan*, are thoſe heavy goods which are caſt into the ſea, before a ſhip is loſt, in order to preſerve theml and that they may be found again, (if providence permits) a buoy is generally faſtened to them.

*Wreck*, ſignifies in our law, ſuch goods as, after a ſhipwreck, are caſt upon land by ſea, and left there within ſome county; for they are not wrecks, ſo long as they remain at ſea, in the juriſdiction of the admiralty.

The king ſhall have *flotſam*, *jetſam*, and *lagan*, when the ſhip' periſheth, or when the owners of the goods are not known; but when the ſhip does not periſh, *e contra* F. N. B. 122, 46 *Edw. III*.

A man may have *flotſam* and *jetſam* by the king's grant, and may have *flotſam* within the high and low-water mark by preſcription, as it appears by thoſe of the Weſt Countries, who preſcribe to have wreck in the ſea, ſo far as they may ſee a *Humber* barrel. *Coke* 5. part. *fol.* 107. *Coke* 2. *Inst.* *fol.* 167.

By the grant of *wreck* will paſs *flotſam*, *jetſam*, and *lagan*, when they are caſt upon the land; but, if they are not caſt upon the land, the admiral hath juriſdiction, and not the common law, and they cannot be called wreck. *Sir Hen. Conſtable*'s caſe. *Coke* 5. part. *fol.* 107.

By the common law all wrecks belonged to the crown, and therefore they are not chargeable with any cuſtoms; becauſe goods corning into the kingdom by wreck, are not imported by any body, but caſt aſhore by the wind and ſea: but it was uſual to ſeize wrecks to the king's uſe, only when no owner could be found; and, in that caſe, the property being in no man, it in conſequence belongs to the king, as lord of the narrow ſeas. *Bract. lib.* 2. *c.* 5. Though when a man, dog, or cat, eſcapes alive out of any ſhip that is loſt, neither the ſhip, nor any thing therein, ſhall be adjudged wreck, but the goods ſhall be faved, and kept a year and a day by the ſheriff, to be reſtored to any perſon who can prove a property in them; and if no body appears to claim in that time, they ſhall be forfeited as wreck; the year and day ſhall be accounted from the ſeizure; and, if the owner of the goods dies before the expiration of that term, his executors or adminiſtrators mav make proof, though, if the goods are *bona peritura*, (periſhable goods) the ſheriff may ſell them within the year, taking care he does it to the beſt advantage, and accounts for their produce. *Westm.* 1. *c.* 4. 3 *Edw.* I. 2 *Inst.* 166. 5 *Rep.* 106.

If a man has a grant of *wreck*, and goods are wrecked upon his lands, and another taketh them away before ſeizure, he may bring an action of treſpaſs, &c. for before they are ſeized, there is no property gained to make it felony. 1 *Hawk.* p. 6, 94.

If goods wrecked are ſeized by perſons having no authority, the owner may have his aaction againſt them; or if the wrong-doers are unknown, he may have a commiſſion to inquire, &c. 2 *Inſt.* 166.

Goods loſt by tempeſt, piracy, &c. and not by wreck, if they afterwards come to land, ſhall be reſtored to the owner. 27 *Edw. III*. c. 13.

When a ſhip is ready to ſink, and all the men therein, for the preſervation of their lives, quit the ſhip, and afterwards ſhe periſhes, if any of the men are ſaved and come to land, the goods are not loſt. 2* Inſt.* 167.

A ſhip on the ſea was chaſed by an enemy; and the men therein, for the ſecurity of their lives, forſook her; ſhe was afterwardstaken by the enemy, ſpoiled of her goods and tackle, and then turned adrift; after this, by stress of weather, she was cast on land, where it happened her men safely arrived: and it was resolved that this was no *wreck*.

Goods may be retained for payment of salvage; but if the ship and goods periſh in the sea, and the owners do totally forfake her, and she thereby becomes a *derelict*, in such case, the first possessor that recovers her, or any part of her lading, gains a *property*; and this, according to the law of nations, *as is that given* for lost, or *whereof there is no hope of recovery*.

The evolution of the law up until the mid-eighteenth century is given by Sir William Blackstone in his *Commentaries on the laws of England*, 1765.

Chapter 8

XI. ANOTHER maritime revenue, and founded partly upon the ſame reaſon, is that of ſhipwrecks; which are alſo declared to be the king's property by the ſame prerogative ſtatute 17 Edw. II. C. 11. and were ſo, long before, at the common law. It is worthy obſervation, how greatly the law of wrecks has been altered, and the rigour of it gradually ſoftened, in favour of the diſtreſſed proprietors. Wreck, by the antient common law, was where any ſhip was loſt at ſea, and the goods or cargo were thrown upon the land; in which caſe theſe goods, ſo wrecked, were adjudged. to belong to the king: for it was held, that, by the loſs of the ſhip, all property was gone out of the original owner `[Dr & St. d. 2. c. 51]`. But this was undoubtedly adding ſorrow to ſorrow, and was conſonant narther to reaſon nor humanity. Wherefore it was firſt ordained by king Henry I, that if any perſon eſcaped alive out of the ſhip it ſhould be no wreck `[Spelm. Cod. apud. Wilkins. 305.]`; and afterwards king Henry II, by his charter `[26 May, A.D. 1174. 1 Rym. Foed. 36.]`, declared, that if on the coaſts of either England, Poictou, Oleron, or Gaſcony, any ſhip ſhould be diſtreſſed, and either man or beaſt ſhould eſcape or be found therein alive, the goods ſhould remain to the owners, if they claimed them within three months; but otherwiſe ſhould be eſteemed a wreck, and ſhould belong to the king, or other lord of the franchiſe. This was again confirmed with improvements by king Richard the firſt, who, in the ſecond year of his reign `[Rog. Hoved. in Ric. I]`, not only eſtabliſhed theſe conceſſions, by ordaining that the owner, if he was ſhipwrecked and eſcaped, *omnes res ſuas hberas et quietas haberet,* but alſo, that, if he periſhed, his children, or in default of them his brethren and ſiſters, ſhould retain the property; and, in default of brother or ſiſter, then the goods ſhould remain to the king. `[In like manner Conſtantine the great, finding that by the imperial law the revenue of wrecks was given to the prince's treaſury or fiſcus, reſtrained it by an edit (Cod. 11. 5. 1) and ordereed them to remain to the owners; adding this humane expoſtulation, "Quod enim jus habet fiſcus in aliena calamitate, ut de re tam luctuoſacompendium ſsectetur?"]` And the law, ſo long after as the reign of Henry III, ſeems ſtill to have been guided by the ſame equitable proviſions. For then if a dog (for inſtance) eſcaped, by which the owner might be diſcovered, or if any certain mark were ſet on the goods, by which they might be known again, it was held to be no wreck. `[Bract. l. 3. c. 3]` And this is certainly moſt agreeable to reaſon; the rational claim of the king being only founded upon this, that the true owner cannot be aſcertained. But afterwards, in the ſtatute of Weſtminſter the firſt `[3 Edw. I. c. 4]`, the law is laid down more agreeable to the charter of king Henry the ſecond: and upon that ſtatute hath ſtood the legal doctrine of wrecks to the preſent time. It enacts, that if any live thing eſcape (a man, a cat, or a dog; which, as in Bracton, are only put for examples `[Flet. 1. c. 44. 2 Inſt. 167.]`) in this caſe, and, as it ſeems, in this caſe only, it is clearly not a legal wreck: but the ſheriff of the county is bound to keep the goods a year and a day (as in France for one year, agreeably to the maritime laws of Oleron `[s. 25]`, and in Holland for a year and an half) that if any man can prove a property in them, either in his own right or by right of repreſentation `[2 Inſt. 168]`, they ſhall be reſtored to him without delay; but, if no ſuch property be proved within that time, they then ſhall be the king's, If the goods are of a periſhable nature, the ſheriff may ſell them, and the money ſhall be liable in their ſtead `[Plowd 166]`. This revenue of wrecks is frequently granted out to lords of manors, as a royal franchiſe; and if any one be thus entitled to wrecks in his own land, and the king's goods are wrecked thereon, the king may claim them at any time, even after the year and day. `[2 Inſt. 168. Bro. Abr. tit. Wreck.]`

IT is to be observed, that in order conſtitute a legal *wreck*, the goods muſt come to land. If they continue at ſea, the law diſtinguiſhes them by the barbarous and uncouth appellations of *Jetſam*, *flotſam*, and *ligan*. Jetſam is where goods are caſt into the ſea, and there ſink and remain under water: flotſam is where they continue ſwimming on the ſurface of the waves: ligan is where they are ſunk in the ſea, but tied to a cork or buoy, in order to be found again. `[5 Rep. 106]` Theſe are alſo the king's, if no owner appears to claim them; but, if any owner appears, he is entitled to recover the poſſeſſion. For even if they be caſt overboard, without any mark or buoy, in order to lighten the ſhip, the owner is not by this act of neceſſity conſtrued to have renounced his property; `[Quat enim res in tempeſtate, levandantnais cauſa, ejiciuntur, bat dominorum permanent. Quia palam eſt, eas non eo animo ejici, quod quis habere nolit. Inſt. 2. 1. s. 48.]` much leſs can things: ligan be ſuppaſed to be abandoned, fince the owner has done all in his power, to aſſert and retain his property. Theſe three are therefore accounted ſo far a diſtinct thing from the former, that by the king's grant to a man of wrecks, things jetſam, flotſam, and ligan will not paſs. `[5 Rep. 108]`

WRECKs, in their legal acceptation, are at preſent not very frequent: it rarely happening that every living creature on board periſhes; and if any ſhould ſurvive, it is a very great chance, ſince the improvement of commerce, navigation, and correſpondence, but the owner will be able to aſſert his property within the year and day limited by law. And in order to preſerve this property entire for him, and if poſſible to prevent wrecks at all, our laws have made many very humane regulations; in a ſpirit quite oppoſite to thoſe ſavage laws, which formerly prevailed in all the northern regions of Europe, and a few years ago were ſtill faid to ſubſiſt on the coaſts of the Baltic ſea, permitting the inhabitants to ſeize on whatever they could get as lawful prize; or, as an author of their own expreſſes it, "*in naufragorum miſeria et calamitate tanquam vultures ad praedam currere*" `[Stiernh, de jure Sueon.  l. 3. c. 5]`. For by the ſtatute 2 Edw. III. c. 13. if any ſhip be loſt on the ſhore, and the goods come to land (ſo as it be not legal wreck) they ſhall be preſently delivered to the merchants, they paying only a reaſonable reward to thoſe that ſaved and preſerved them, which is intitled *ſalvage*. Alſo by the common law, if any perſons, other than the ſheriff) take any goods fo caſt on ſhore, which are not legal wreck, the owners might have a commiſſion to enquire and find them out, and compel them to make reſtitution `[F. N. B. 112]`. And by ſtatute 12 Ann. ſt. 2. c. 18. confirmed by 4 Geo. I. c. 12. in order to aſſiſt the diſtreſſed, and prevent the ſcandalous illegal practices on ſome of our ſea coaſts, (too ſimilar to thoſe on the Baltic) it is enacted, that all head-officers and others of towns near the ſea ſhall, upon application made to them, ſummon as many hands as are neceſſary, and ſend them to the relief of any thip i in diſtreſs, on forfeiture of 100*l.* and, in caſe of aſſiſtance given, ſalvage ſhall be paid by the owners, to be aſſeſſed by three neighbouring juſtices. All perſons that ſecrete any goods ſhall forfeit their treble value: and if they wilfully do any act whereby the ſhip is loſt or deſtroyed, by making holes in her, ſtealing her pumps, or otherwiſe, they are guilty. of felony, without benefit of clergy. Laſtly, by the ſtatute 26 Geo. II. c. 19. plundering any veſſel either in diſtreſs, or wrecked, and whether any living creature be on board or not, (for, whether wreck or otherwiſe, it is clearly not the property of the populace) ſuch plundering, I ſay, or preventing the eſcape of any perſon that endeavors to ſave his life, or wounding him with intent to deſtroy him, or putting out falſe lights in order to bring any veſſel into danger, are all declared to be capital felonies; in like manner as the deſtroying trees, ſteeples, or other ſtated ſeamarks, is puniſhed by the ſtatute 8 Eliz. c. 13. with a forfeiture of 200*l.* Moreover, by the ſtatute of George II, pilfering any goods caft aſhore is declared to be petty larceny; and many other ſalutary regulations are made, for the more effecually preſerving thips of my: nation in diſtreſs. `[By the civil law, to deſtroy perſons ſhipwrecked, or prevent their ſaving the ſhip, is capital. And to ſteal even a plank from a veſſel in diſtreſs, or wrecked, makes the party liable to anſwer for the whole ſhip  and cargo (Ff. 47. 9.3). The laws alſo of the Wiſigoths, and the moſt early Neapolitan conſtitutions, puniſhed with the utmoſt ſeverity all thoſe who neglected to aſſiſt any ſhip in diſtreſs, or plundered any goods caſt  on ſhore. (Lindenbrog. Cod. LL. antiq. 146. 75.]`
