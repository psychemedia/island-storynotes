# Rules of the Sea and the Shore

One of the defining features of any state is the definition and the extent of its laws, which we might think of having either negotiated or natural borders, which for an island nation we might naturally consider to be the shoreline. But what of the jurisdiction of the sea? And what of goods or wrecks that pass from the sea to the shore?

Wrecking - oleron

Article XXV

If a ship or other vessel arriving at any place, and making in towards a port or harbor, set out her flag, or give any other sign to have a pilot come aboard, or a boat to tow her into the harbor, the wind or tide being contrary, and a contract be made for piloting the said vessel into the said harbor accordingly; but by reason of an unreasonable and accursed custom, in some places, that the third or fourth part of the ships that are lost, shall accrue to the lord of the place where such sad casualties happen, as also the like proportion to the salvors, and only the remainder to the master, merchant and mariners: the persons contracting for the pilotage of the said vessel, to ingratiate themselves with their lords, and to gain to themselves a part of the ship and lading, do like faithless and treacherous villains, sometimes even willingly, and out of design to ruin ship and goods, guide and bring her upon the rocks, and then feigning to aid, help and assist, the now distressed mariners, are the first in dismembering and pulling the ship to pieces; purloining and carrying away the lading thereof contrary to all reason and good conscience: and afterwards that they may be the more welcome to their lord, do with all speed post to his house with the sad narrative of this unhappy disaster; whereupon the said lord, with his retinue appearing at the places, takes his share; the salvors theirs; and what remains the merchant and mariners may have. But seeing this is contrary to the law of God, our edict and determination is, that notwithstanding any law or custom to the contrary, it is said and ordained, the said lord of that place, salvors, and all others that take away any of the said goods, shall be accursed and excommunicated, and punished as robbers and thieves, as formerly hath been declared. But all false and treacherous pilots shall be condemned to suffer a most rigorous and unmerciful death; and high gibbets shall be erected for them in the same place, or as high as conveniently may be, where they so guided and brought any ship or vessel to ruin as aforesaid, and thereon these accursed pilots are with ignominy and much shame to end their days; which said gibbets are to abide and remain to succeeding ages on that place, as a visible caution to other ships that shall afterwards sail thereby.

Article XXVI

If the lord of any place be so barbarous, as not only to permit such inhuman people, but also to maintain and assist them in such villainies, that he may have a share in such wrecks, the said lord shall be apprehended, and all his goods confiscated and sold, in order to make restitution to such as of right it appertaineth; and himself to be fastened to a post or stake in the midst of his own mansion house, which being fired at the four corners, all shall be burnt together, the walls thereof shall be demolished, the stones pulled down, and the place converted into a market place for the sale only of hogs and swine to all posterity.

Article XXIX

If any ship or other vessel sailing to and fro, and coasting the seas, as well in the way of merchandizing, as upon the fishing account, happen by some misfortune through the violence of the weather to strike herself against the rocks, whereby she becomes so bruised and broken, that there she perishes, upon what coasts, country or dominion soever; and the master, mariners, merchant or merchants, or any one of these escape and come safe to land; in this case the lord of that place or country, where such misfortune shall happen, ought not to let, hinder, or oppose such as have so escaped, or such to whom the said ship or vessel, and her lading belong, in using their utmost endeavors for the preservation of as much thereof as may possibly be saved. But on the contrary, the lord of that place or country, by his own interest, and by those under his power and jurisdiction, ought to be aiding and assisting to the said distressed merchants or mariners, in saving their shipwrecked goods, and that without the least embezzlement, or taking any part thereof from the right owners; but, however, there may be a remuneration or consideration for salvage to such as take pains therein, according to right reason, a good conscience, and as justice shall appoint; notwithstanding what promises may in that case have been made to the salvors by such distressed merchants and mariners, as is declared in the fourth article of these laws; and in case any shall act contrary hereunto, or take any part of the said goods from the said poor, distressed, ruined, undone, shipwrecked persons, against their wills, and without their consent, they shall be declared to be excommunicated by the church, and ought to receive the punishment of thieves; except speedy restitution be made by them: nor is there any custom or statute whatsoever, that can protect them against the aforesaid penalties, as is said in the 26th article of these laws.

Article XLVI

If any ship, or other vessel, by any casualty or misfortune happens to be wrecked and perish, in that case, the pieces of the hulk of the vessel, as well as the lading thereof, ought to be reserved and kept in safety for them to whom it belonged before such disaster happened, notwithstanding any custom to the contrary. And all takers, partakers, or consenters of, or to the said wreck, if they be bishops, prelates or clerks, they shall be deposed and deprived of their benefices respectively; and if they be laymen they shall incur the penalties aforesaid. De his autem quos diripuisse probatum sit, praesides ut de latronibus, gravem sententiam dicere convenit. l. ne quid. l. quo Naufrag. D. Incendio, ruina, & naufragio. l navigia, C. furtis. The penalties aforesaid are in the 25th, 26th and 29th articles.

Article XLVII

This is to be understood only when the said ship or vessel so wrecked, did not exercise the trade of pillaging, and when the mariners thereof were not pirates, sea-rovers, or enemies to our holy Catholic faith; but if they are found to be either the one or the other, every man may then deal with such as with rogues, and despoil them of their goods without any punishment for so doing.



shipwreck - Oleron

Article XXX

If a ship or other vessel entering into harbor, happens by misfortune to be broken and perish, and the master, mariners and merchants, which were on board her, be all drowned; and if the goods thereof be driven ashore, or remain floating on the sea, without being sought after by those to whom they belong, they being ignorant of this said disaster, and knowing nothing thereof in this most lamentable case, the lord of that place or country ought to send persons to save the said goods, which he ought to secure and to put into safe custody; and give the relations of the deceased persons who were drowned, notice of it, and to satisfy for the salvage thereof, not out of his own purse, but of the goods saved, according to the hazards run, and the pains taken therein; and what remains must be kept in safe custody for one year or more; and if in that time they to whom the said goods appertain, do not appear and claim the same, and the said year be fully expired, he may publicly sell and dispose thereof to such as will give most, and with the monies proceeding of the sale thereof, he ought to give among the poor, and for portions to poor maids, and other charitable uses, according to reason and good conscience. But if he assumes the said goods either in whole or in part unto himself, he shall incur the curse and malediction of our mother the holy church, with the aforesaid pains and penalties, without ever obtaining remission, unless he make satisfaction.

Article XXXI

If a ship or other vessel happens to be lost by striking on some shore, and the mariners thinking to save their lives, reach the shore, in hope of help, and instead thereof it happens, as it often does, that in many places they meet with people more barbarous, cruel, and inhuman than mad dogs, who to gain their monies, apparel, and other goods, do sometimes murder and destroy these poor distressed seamen; in this case, the lord of that country ought to execute justice on such wretches, to punish them as well corporally as pecuniarily, to plunge them in the sea till they be half dead, and then to have them drawn forth out of the sea, and stoned to death.

?Flotsom and jetsam?

Article XXXII - oleron

If by reason of tempestuous weather, it be thought expedient, for the lightening of any ship or vessel at sea, or riding at anchor in any road, to cast part of the lading overboard, and it be done accordingly for the common safety, though the said goods so ejected, and cast over-board, do become his that can first possess himself thereof, and carry them away: nevertheless, it is here to be further understood, that this holds true only in such cases, as when the master, merchant, and mariners have so ejected or cast out the said goods, as that they give over all hope or desire of ever recovering them again, and so leave them as things utterly lost and given over by them, without ever making any enquiry or pursuit after them: in which case only the first occupant becomes the lawful proprietor thereof.

Article XXXIII

If a ship, or any other vessel, hath cast overboard several goods or merchandises, which are in chests well locked and made fast; or books well clasped and shut close, that they may not be damnified by salt water; in such cases it is to be presumed, that they who did cast such goods overboard, do still retain an intention, hope, and desire of recovering the same: for which reason, such as shall happen to find such things, are obliged to make restitution thereof to him who shall make a due enquiry after them; or put them to pious uses, according to his conscience and the advice of some prudent neighbor.

Article VIII

If a vessel be laden to sail from Bordeaux to Caen, or any other place, and it happens that a storm overtakes her at sea, so violent, that she cannot escape without casting some of the cargo overboard for lightening the vessel, and preserving the rest of the lading, as well as the vessel itself then the master ought to say, Gentlemen, We must throw part of the goods overboard; and, if there are no merchants to answer him, or if those that are there approve of what he says by their silence, then the master may do as he thinks fit; and if the merchants are not pleased with his throwing over any part of the merchandise, and forbid him, yet the master ought not to forbear casting out so many of the goods as he shall see to be for the common good and safety; he and the third part of his mariners making oath on the Holy Evangel-ists, when they arrive at their port of discharge, that he did it only for the preservation of the vessel, and the rest of the lading that remains yet in her. And the wines, or other goods, that were cast overboard, ought to be valued or prized according to the just value of the other goods that arrive in safety. And when these shall be sold, the price or value thereof ought to be divided livre a livre among the merchants. The master may compute the damage his vessel has sustained, or reckon the freight of the goods thrown overboard at his own choice. If the master does not make it appear that he and his men did the part of able seamen, then neither he nor they shall have any thing. The mariners also ought to have one tun free, and another divided by cast of the dice, according as it shall happen, and the merchants in this case may lawfully put the master to his oath.

Article XLIII

In all other things found by the sea side, which have formerly been in the possession of some one or other, as wines, oil, and other merchandize, although they have been cast overboard, and left by the merchants, and so ought to appertain to him that first finds the same; yet herein also the custom of the country is to be observed as well as in the case of fish. But if there be a presumption that these were the goods of some ship that perished, then neither the said lord, nor finder thereof, shall take any, to convert any part of it to their own use; but as has been said, distribute the money it produces amongst the poor and needy.

Article XXXIV

If any man happens to find any thing in the sea, or in the sand on the shore, in floods or in rivers, if it be precious stones, fishes, or any treasure of the sea, which never belonged to any man in point of property, it belongs to the first finder.

Article XXXVI

If any going along the sea-shore to fish, or otherwise, happens to find gold or silver, he shall be bound to make restitution thereof, deducting for his own pains; or if he be poor he may keep it to himself that is, if he knows not to whom to restore it; yet he shall give notice of the place where he found it, to the neighborhood and parts next adjacent, and advise with his superiors, who ought to weigh and take into consideration the property of the finder, and then to give him such advice as is consonant to good conscience.



## Concerning Wrecks of the Sea

In the early 1300s, the law of the land concerning *"wrecks of the sea"* that was extant at the time was a regulation passed in 1275, the third year of the reign of Edward I:

> IV. CONCERNING Wrecks of the Sea, it is agreed, That where a Man, a Dog, or a Cat escape quick out of the ship, that such Ship nor Barge, nor any thing within them, shall be adjudged Wreck; but the Goods shall be saved and kept by view of the sheriff, Coroner, or the King's Bailiff, and delivered into the hands of such as are of the Town where the Goods were found; so that if any sue for those Goods, and after prove `[can prove]` that they were his, `[or his Lord's]` or perished in his keeping, within a Year and a Day, they shall be restored to him without delay; and if not, they shall remain to the King, and be seised by the sheriffs, Coroners, and Bailiffs `[Sheriff and Coroner]`, and shall be delivered to them of the Town, which shall answer before the Justices of the Wreck belonging to the King; And where Wreck belongeth to another than to the King, he shall have it in like manner. And he that otherwise doth, and thereof be attainted, shall be awarded to Prison, and make Fine at the King's Will, and shall yield Damages also. And if a Bailiff do it and it be disallowed by the Lord, `[and be disavowed of his Lord]` and the Lord will not pretend any Title thereunto, `[will not discharge him thereof]` the Bailiff shall answer, if he have whereof; and if he have not whereof, the Lord shall deliver his Bailiff's Body to the King.

Lex mercatoria: or, the merchant's companion. Containing all the laws and statutes relating to merchandize. ... The second edition corrected, with the addition of three entire new chapters. And also a merchant's dictionary, ...  1729
by Jacob, Giles

Publication date 1729

p. 145-151

CHAP. V.

Of Wrecks, in whom the Property is vested by the Civil Law; Of the King's Prerogative in Relation to Wrecks; And of the Admiralty; Of Flotsam, Jetsam, and Lagan, &c.

IN ancient Times, all Wrecks belong'd to the Crown; but by stat. 3 Ed. 1. it is ordained, that when either a Man, a Dog, or a Cat, or any Thing escapes alive out of the ship, there shall be no Wreck, but the same shall be kept a Year and a Day by the sheriff, to be restored to any Person that can prove a Property in the Goods within that Time; and if no Body comes, then the same is to be forfeited to the King, or rather the Lord High Admiral, to whom they are granted by Patent.

But it was usual to seize Wrecks as forfeited to the King, only when no Owner could be found; for the Property being in that Case in no Man, it must of Consequence belong to the King, as Lord of the narrow seas, which he is obliged to scower of Pyrates, &c. and the Product of Wrecks was ordained to contribute to the Charge. And *Bracton* says, there shall be no Wreck where the Owner comes and makes Claim to the Goods, without Limitation of Time.

If a ship be ready to sink, and all the Men therein, for the Preservation of their Lives, quit the ship, and afterwards she perishes; if any of the Men are saved, and come to Land, the Goods are not lost.

A ship on the sea was chased by an Enemy; the Men therein, for the security of their Lives, quitted the Ship; the Enemy took the Ship, and spoil'd her of her Goods and Tackle, and turned her to sea; by stress of Weather she is cast on Land, where it happen'd her Men safely arriv'd. It was resolved, that the ship was no Wreck. 5 R. 2. Fishlake's Case. Co. 2. Inst. fol. 167.

Where a Wreck happens by any Fault or Negligence in the Master or Mariners, the Master must make Good the Loss; but if the same was occasioned by the Act of God, or done to avoid an Enemy, or Pyrate, &c. there he shall be excus'd. And if the Master, or any of the Mariners lie ashore, and the ship during their Absence, perisheth, whether by Night or by Day, the Master or Mariners, so lying ashore, shall sustain the Damage; and those who remain'd in the ship, shall be excused. Leg. Rhod.

If a ship and Goods perish in the sea, and the Owners abandon her, so that she becomes a mere Derelict; in such Case, the first Person that takes Possession of her, and recovers any Part of the Lading, gains a Property by the Laws of Nations. And if a ship perishes only, and the Goods are safe; in that Case, by the *Rhodian* Law, the Goods ought to pay a Proportion of a fifth or tenth Penny, according to the Difficulty in saving the Goods; (wherein rich Goods, such as Gold and silver, silk, &c. pay less than Goods of great Weight and Cumber, they being in less Danger) for the salvage.

Owners claiming a Wreck, must make sufficient Proof of their Title within the Year and Day; and they are to do it by their Marks or Cocquets, by the Book of Customs, or the Testimony of reputable Men; and if the Wreck be taken by the King, the Party may sue out a Commission to hear and determine by the Oaths of twelve Men; or he may bring his Action at Law. F. N. B. Fol. 12.

When Goods wreck'd are perishable, the sheriff may sell them within the Year and Day, and the sale shall be good; but he must dispose of them for the best Advantage, and account with the Owners. And by the Laws of France, all ships and Persons belonging to them, that shall be cast ashore by Tempest, or otherwise, upon the Coasts of that Kingdom, and every Thing that has escap'd shipwreck, is declared to be taken into the Protection of the King.

By the Civil Law, if any Person steal shipwreck'd Goods, they shall pay four-fold to the Owner, if pursued within a Year and a Day, and as much to the Prince, or his Admiral; and so careful is this Law in requiring Restitution, that the very stealing of a Nail, or the Worth thereof, oblig'd the Thief to the Restitution of all the remaining Goods. And by the Emperor Antonius was made a Law, That such Criminals should be banish'd for three Years, if they were of high Rank; and those that were base and ignoble, were to be scourged and sent to the Gallies. By the same Law, if any Man should prevent Assistance to shipwreck'd Persons, he was to be punish'd as a Murderer; and the like Punishment was ordain'd for those who should, by Treachery, put forth any Lanthorn or Light, with Intention to subject them to Danger or shipwreck. Hence it is that Fishers are forbidden to fish with Lights in the Night.

If Goods are wreck'd on shore, and the Lord, having Power, takes them, he shall not pay Custom, neither by the Common Law, nor by the statute Law; for at the Common Law, wreck'd Goods could not be charg'd with Custom, by Reason the Wreck is wholly the King's, and he could not have a Custom out of what was all his own. Stat. West. 1. Shep versus Gosnold. Hill. 23 & 24 Car. 2. Rot. 615.

And Wines or other Goods, coming or brought into the Kingdom by Wreck, are not imported by any Body, but by the Wind and sea; for such Goods are destitute of a Proprietor, until the Law appoints one: And wreck'd Goods are not brought into the Kingdom, (being cast ashore) as Merchandise for sale. Goods drown'd, or lost in passing a Ferry, a great River, or Arm of the sea, are not to be said exported, although they be carried to sea.

By stat. 12 Annae c. 18. it is enacted, That sheriffs, Justices of Peace, Head Officers of Towns, &c. and Officers of the Customs, in all Places where a ship shall be in Danger of being stranded, or run on shore, upon Application to them made on Behalf of the Commander of the ship, shall command the Constables to assemble as many Men as shall be necessary for the Preservation of the ship. And if there be any ships of War lying at Anchor near the Place, then the Officers of such ships are to send forth their Boats, and as many Men as they can spare, to her Assistance, under the Penalty of 100*l.* to be recover'd by the Officer of the ship in Distress.

When a ship is preserv'd by these Means, the Persons who assisted therein, shall, within thirty Days after, be paid a reasonable Reward for the same, by the Officer of the ship, or Merchant; and in Default thereof, the ship or Goods shall remain in the Custody of the Officers of the Customs, as a security.

Persons entering such ship in Distress, without Leave from the Commander, Constable, &c. or molesting any one in the salvage, shall make double satisfaction within twenty Days. And if any Goods are carried off from such ship, and found on any Person, if they are not delivered to the Owner on Demand, such Person shall be liable to pay treble the Value of the Goods.

If any Officer of the Customs, or his Deputy, abuse the Trust reposed in him, and shall be convicted thereof, he shall forfeit treble Damages to the Party grieved, and be incapable of any Employment in the Customs.

And by this statute to make a Hole in the Bottom, side, or in any Part of the ship; or do any Thing tending to the Loss of the ship, is made Felony, without the Benefit of Clergy.

This Act is not to extend to deprive the Crown, or any Grantee, of any Right or Claim to any Wreck or Goods that shall be *Jetsam*, *Flotsam*, or *Lagan*.

*Flotsam, Jetsam, &c.*

*Flotsam*, *Jetsam*, and *Lagan*, are Goods on or in the sea, and belong to the King or Lord Admiral,

*Flotsam* is when a ship is sunk or cast away, and the Goods float upon the sea.

*Jetsam* is where the ship is in Danger of sinking, and the Goods are cast into the sea for the lightening of the ship, and notwithstanding the ship perisheth.

*Lagan* is when heavy Goods are cast into the sea before the Perishing of the ship; and being sunk, the Master or Mariners fasten a Buoy, or other sea-Mark, to them, whereby they may more easily be directed to the Place where they lie.

The King shall have *Flotsam*, *Jetsam*, and *Lagan*, when the ship perisheth, or when the Owners of the Goods are not known, but not otherwise. F. N. B. 122.

A Man may have *Flotsam* and *Jetsam* by the King's Grant; and may have *Lagan* within the high and low Water-Mark by Prescription, as it appears in the Ve- Country, where the Lords of Manors prescribe to have Wreck in the sea, so far as they can see a Humber-Barrel.

*Wreccum Maris* are such Goods only as are cast and left upon the Land by the sea.

By the Grant of Wreck will pass *Flotsam*, *Jetsam*, and *Lagan*, when they are cast upon the Land; but if they are not cast upon the Land, the Admiral hath Jurisdiction, and not the Common Law, and they cannot be said to be Wreck.

King Edward the second, in the first Year of his Reign, granted by Charter the Castle of Carisbrook, with all the Lands and Tenements, in the Isle of Wight, then formerly belonging to the Countess of Albemarle, to his Favourite Peter de Gaveston and Margaret his Wife, and the Heirs of their two Bodies begotten, with several other Castles and Lands; but they being soon after reseized into the King's Lands, he granted this Castle, with all its services, and all his Lands in that Isle, to Edward his son, and his Heirs, Kings of England; and afterwards, for the ascertaining what did of Right belong to the same Castle, a Writ of Inquisition was issued out, by which it was found *inter alia, quod wreccum Maris, pertinens ad dictum Castrum*, &c.

So that without special Words in the Patent granted to the Lord High Admiral, the Wreck of this Isle will not pass.

*An Affidavit that a ship is cast away.*

A. B. of, &c. Mariner, lately hir'd in the good ship, &c. in a Voyage to, &c. maketh Oath, That on, &c. last past, near the Cape of, &c. the said ship, proceeding in her said Voyage, was cast away in a storm, whereby the said ship, the Cargo, and all the Goods on Board perished, and were intirely lost: And that only the Master and, &c. of the Men were saved, the rest of the ship's Crew being drown'd. *And* this Deponent farther deposeth, That neither he, this Deponent, nor any other, to his Use, hath received, or doth expect to receive any Benefit of or by the Goods so lost, or any Part thereof, by any Ways or Means whatever.

*A Testimonial for a Person suffering shipwreck.*

TO all Constables, &c. Greeting, Whereas A. B. the Bearer hereof, aged about, &c. having this Day been before me C. D. Esq; one of his Majesty's Justices of the Peace for the County of, &c. and made it appear, that on, &c. last, he the said A. B. being on Board the ship called, Ge. suffer'd. shipwreck on the Coast of, &c. and with much ado got to Land at, &c. And the said A. B. by Reason of his Indisposition, occasion'd by the said shipwreck, is become unable to travel to his Place of settlement, or to relieve himself in his Journey thither. These are therefore to require and desire you not only to permit the said A. B. to travel to, &c. the Place of his Birth, without Molestation, but also to assist him in his Conveyance thither, and in the necessary Expences for his Relief in his Journey. Given, &c.

That the conveyance tothe Plaintiff of the Marmor and fee aforcſaid was, true as he hath declared 3 and that the aj Mannor figer arens aqna ſalſa minime coopertas Manerii de Baneſton, infra fluxum & refluxum maris in Manerio de Barnefton, oy: for other parcels of the goods, that they whe Sealy ſuper aquas mars refluentes ex arenis ou/dem Maneriz de Barneſton infra fluxum & refluxum maris, &&c.,” And that the Defendant took all the' (aid g00ds and'(ciſed them to the uſe of the Lord Admiral, &c, And damages afſeſſed entirely for all :' And ſi ſufer'totam materiam, &c. And this Caſe was often well argued at Bar and Bench, and at the laſt Judgment was given againſt the Plaintiff, And in this Caſe five: Points were reſolved: PR” 1, That nothing ſhall be faid Y/reccum maris, but ſuch goods only which are caſt and left uport the land by the Sea 3 for Wreceum maris ſignificat illa bona, que naufragio ad terram tur : Flofam is when a Skip is ſank, or otherwile periſhed, and the goods flote upon the Sea; Jelfems is when the Ship 15 1n danger to be ſunk, and for lightning of the Ship the goods are. caſt into the Sea, and afterwards notwithſranding the Ship perifheth, Lagan, or rather Ligan, is when the goods which are ſo caſt into the Sea, and afterwards the Ship periſheth, and ſuch goods fo caft are fo heavy that they fink to the bottom, and the Mariners to the intent to have ther again#tie to them a boy, or cork; or ſuch other thin will not ſink, ſo that they may find then again, and it is called Ligan a ligando 3 and norie goods which are called Fetſam, FlorſamF#and Ligan are called wreck ſo long as they remain in or upon the Sea, but if any of t by the Sea be put upon the land, then-they hall be ſaid wreek. .

2. In this Caſe it was reſolved by the whole Court, that the foil upon which the Seca floweth'ay Þþ ebbeth 3 ſcil. between the high water mark and low water mark may be parcel of the Mannor of a Sy, jc, 16 Eliz. Dier 316. acc', And fo it was adjudged in Lacie's Caſe, Trin. 25 Eliz. in this Cay, And yet it was recſoved, That when the Sca floweth and hath plenitudinem maris, the Admiral ſhall ae Þ juriſdiction of every thing done upon the water, between the high "water mark and low water nai, by the ordinary and natural courſe of the Sea : And ſo it was adjudged in the faid Caſe of Lacy, th the felony done upon the Sea ad plenitudinem maris, between the high water mark and the low wr mark, by the ordinary and natural courſe of the Sea, the Admiral ſhall have juriſdiction 3 and yet wha the Sea doth ebb, the land may belong to a Subje&t, and cvery thing done upon the land when theland is cbbed ſhall be tried at the Common Law, for the ſame is then parccl of the County, and infrumy Comitat”, and therewith agxeeth 8 E. 4. 19.', So note, that below the low mark the Admiral hat ty ſole and abſolute juriſdiction, and between, the high water. mark and low water mark, the Conny Law and the Admiral have feviſvem Imperium; itcrchangeably as is atorcſaid, ſcil. gne upon the waz and the other upon the land. And Sir John Popham Chict Juſtice ſaid, That in trial of a Nife between the City of Briſtow and the Lord Berkley, it was holden by the Juſtices of Afliſe #That wh the Lord Berkley had a Mannor adjoyning to the Severn, and preſcribed to bave wreck within his nor, and certain goods floted between the high Water and low wates mark, ,and the City of Brifll Flotſam there z And it was holden that the ſaid goods were not wreck as Jong as they were flotingyy the water between high water and low water mark. Sce the Book in 5 E. 3. 3. in a Replevin brayt by William de N, of London againſt Sir Henry Newil, and counted that the Defcndant took thre of Herrings, and a Ship and the Defendant pleaded that he was Lord of the Mannor of Warling, ul preſcribed to have wreck within his Mannor, and that the Herring and Ship were wreck within Mannor : To which the Plaintiff ſaid, that they were our goods in the keeping of the Mariners whi arrived by the Sea,and that he took them out of their cuſtody : Judgment if he can claim as wreck? which the Defendant ſaid, we took them as wreck, Hors de.cheſcun gard 3 upon,which Book I oblen three things, 1. That wreck may be claimed by preſcription 3 2. That for as much as a Ship amt be wreck, ſcil. caſt upon the land, but between the high and low water mark, that there it fold that that was parcel of the mayor : 3. That if the Ship perith, yet if any of the ſcrvants eſcaps, f Law faith, that they have the cuſtody of the goods, andythey are not wreck, 39 E. 3. 5. One preſabd to have royal Fiſhes, as Porps, 6c. found within his Mannor, that it ſecmeth to be between the highal low water mark. _- SE | |

3+ It was reſolved, That the King ſhall have Flotſam, Jetſam, & Lagan, when the Ship periſhah 0 when the Owners of the goods are known, as in 46 E, 3.15. appeareth, that goods caſt into te for fear of tempelt are not forfeit. Vide Fe..N. B. 112. c. 5 E. 3. 3. 9 E. 4. 22. that the Ship ouſt 0 periſh, which is called ſhipwrack ; And that is alſo proved by the A&t of Weſt. 1. cap. 4. whit faid, If a man, dog, or cat eſcape alive, (which is to be intended when the Ship peritheth) axdthers with aprecth Bradon, lib. 2. cap. 18. fol. 41." Ttem ſine traditione res babita pro derelift”, ubi Domink fat deſinit eſſe Dominus, fi autem cauſa navis alleviande, non fic, quia non ea voluntate tjecit quis, ut deſuat 4 Dominus. And a man may have Flotſam and. Jetſam by. the Kings Grant, and may have Flotſam witiW the high and low water marks by preſcription, as it appeareth before. And thoſe of the Weſt Count preſcribe to have wreck in the Sea ſo far as they may ſee a Humber barrel.

4. It was reſolved, that the Statute of We. 2. cap. 4. by which it is enacted, That of wreck of tt Sea it is agreed, that there where a man, dog, or cat, eſcape alive out of the Ship or Veſſel, not thing within them ſhall be adjudged wreck, byt the goods ſhall be ſaved and kept by the view of Sheriff , Coroner, or Kings Bayliff, 8c. ſo that if any ſue for thoſe goods, and can prove i they belonged to him, or that they periſhed - in his keeping within a year and a day, they {hall be ſtored to him without delay, &c. was but a declaration of the Common Law ; and therefore all that which is provided as to wreck, extendeth alſo to Flotſam, Jetſam, and Lagan.

preccn f i made) dot claim the ſame within a year and a day, the ſame is forfeited. So a year and a day is

ie *| given in Caſe of Appeal, and in Caſe of Deſcent after entry or claim 3 of Nonclaim upon fine, or Writ

= ih right at the Common Law 3 of a Villam dwelling in Ancient demeſne ; of the death of a man who

s 236 hath blow or wound 3 of Protections, Effoins of the Kings ſervice, and in many other Caſes : And the

Quare ear and day in Caſe of wreck, ſhall be accounted from the taking or ſeiſure of them as wreck; for

jor ſui although that the property is in Law veſted in the Lord betore ſeiſure, yet until the Lord (ciſeth, and.

fa re. (hall repair to make his claim, and to ſhew to him his proofs. And if the wreck doth belong to the [ 108 | On | King, the party may have a Commiſſion to hear and determine the truth of it, and that by verdict of ey enatl Þ AEST a honeſt men, for no proof is allowable by Law, but the verdi& of twelve men : And if it doth,

"orette have ſuch Commitſion, or may bring his Action at the Common Law, and prove the ſame by the verdict of a Jury. And if the Commiſſion be awarded, or the Adion be brought within the year and day, rig although the verdict be given for him afterwards, it is ſufficient. See Regiſter and F. N,. B. 12, For the

acy, tlut : ry, 4 man may preſcribe to have wreck, as it appeareth in 11 H.4, 16, Stramf. 38, F.N.B. 91. a. 5 Hi7. "2 36, 5.3: 3- & 59. 9 E. 4.12, Ov. 6 When | 5. It was reſolved in the Caſe at Bar, That part of the goods paſſed by the name of wreck, and part cla of the goods were Flotſam, and did not paſs by the grant of wreck, and'damages were intirely aſſeſſed frumu We for all. And in Treſpaſs the Plaintiff ſhall recover damages only for the value of the goods, and for hat in this cauſe Judgment was given againſt the Plaintiff, And the Book in 21 H. 7. 43. was cited, where the A_ Caſe is, That in Treſpaſs the Defendant juſtifieth as to one thing, and pleadeth Not Guilty of another, and theyare at iſſue, and the Jury enquired of one thing only, and taxed the damages for both entirely. ' Fineux hed the verdict good for the thing found, and that he ſhould have a Writ of Enquiry of dam; apes, Qyod fit negatum per totam Curiam. Dier 22 Eliz. 269. in Ejectione cuſtodie agreeth with this Judgment, And it was adjudged M. 14 & 15 Eliz. in this Court in Treſpais by Pooly againſt Osburn of ing his Cloſe and. beating his ſervant, and doth not fay, per quod ſervitium amiſit, the Defendant pleaded Not Guilty, and the} urors found him gulty and aſſeſſed damages intirely ; and becauſe the | Plaintiff had not cauſe of Action for beating of his ſervant, becauſe he hath not averred that he loſt his ſervice, for this cauſe the Plaintiff took nothing by his Bill. And Catline then Chief Juſtice cauſed the reaſowand cauſe of the Judgment to be at large ſet down in the margent of the Record, 9 H.7. 3. in Reſeow ace*. And it was adjudged accordingly, M. 3o & 31 Eliz. between More and Bedell, in an AQion upon the Caſe upon Aſſume which began in the Kings Bench, M. 28 & 29 Eliz. Rot. 476. where the Defendant promiſed to do divers things, and the Plaintiff alledged two breaches, whereof one was inſufficient, the Defendant pleaded Non afſumpfit, the Jury gave damage generally. . It was reſolved, 1. That it ſhall be intended that they gave damages for both : 2. That for as much as the Phintiff had no cauſe of :damages for the one, for this cauſe the Judgment given for the Plaintiff in the Kage Bench was reverſed by a Writ of Error brought in the Exchequer Chamber. | NoteReader, at the firſt, the Common Law gave as well Wreck ,, Fetſam,” Flotſam, and Logan upon the Sea, as Eftray (which BraGon calleth animalia vagantia) or as other call them animalia vacantia, quiz Domino vateri debent, treaſure trove, and the like to the King, becauſe that by the rule of the Common Law, 'when no man can claim property in any goods, the King ſhall have them by his Prerogative. And therefore Bra&on, lib. 3. cap. 3. faith, Smnt alia qguedam que in nullius bonis eſſe dicunt”, ficut wreecum mart,” groſſus piſcis, ſicxtt flurgio, O& balena, & alie res que Dominum non babent, ſicut animalia vagantia, que fuat Dominz Regis propter privilegizem. So that it appeareth by Bradon that the King ſhall have Wreck,as he ſtall have great fiſhes, 6c. becauſe they are nullius in bonis, or as he ſhall have animalia vagantia, five vacantis, ſeil, Eftrays, becatſe none claimeth the property. And note, that Wreck is Eftray upon the Sea coming ito land,. as eltray of beaſts is upon the land coming within any priviledged placez and the Law glvethin both Caſes a year and a day to claim them, And Bra&on in the ſame Book, 1b, 3. cap. 33s fol. 135/faith, Navis, nec batellus, nec alia catalla de bis qui ſubmerfi ſunt mari, nec in ſalſa nec in dulci aqua, ' wpreccum erit, cunt fit qui catalla illa aduocet, & hoc docere poterit , and fo he fitly betore refembleth it to an | Efiray: And if the goods of an Infant, feme covert Executrix, a man in priſon, or beyond Sea, cfiray | , and be proclaimed according to the Law, if none claim them within the'year and the day, they all ſhall | bebounden,” The ſame Law is of wreck of Sea, for the Law is firict and binding in both Caſes 3 buc it appeareth-by the opinion of Braon and Britton alſo, that Flotſam, Fetſam, and Lagan, ſo long as they ae mor upon-the Sea, do not appertain to the King, ſed occrpants concedunt”, quia non eſt aliquis qui inde Irnilegiuans babere poſit, Rex non magis quam privata perſona propter incertum rei eventum ('& paulo ante reddit inde rationem ) eo quad conftare non poſit ad quam regionem efſent applicanda, And Britton, lib, 1, cap. 17. Treaſure hid in the ground, we will that it be ours, and if it be found in the Sea, be it to the hnder. But 3S It appeareth before by the Reſolution of the whole Court, the Kirg {hall have Flotrſam, Jetſam, and Laganas is aforeſaid,by his Prerogative,although they be in or upon the Seca : And the Sea is of the Kings all eance,and parcel of his Crown of England:as it is holden in 6 R.2. Proteion 46. & Britton, cap3. well agreeth with the opinion of Bradon, ſcil. that Wreck is a thing in n«lins bonis 3, for there he ſaith, cre is alſo purchaſe by Franchiſe granted, by name of a thing found in no mans goods,as a Wreck of Sea, and cattle eſtraying,Conies,Hares,Patridges,and other ſavage beaſis,by franchiſe to have Wreck found in his biland waif and firay found in fee, Warrens, and his demeſne lands,

the trade of New Spain. When theflota arrives at the Havanna, and joins the galleons and regifter fhips, which afTemble at the fame port from all quarters, fome of the cleaned and beft failing veflels are difpatched to Old Spaini with advice of the contents of thefe feveral fleets, as well as with treafure and goods of their own, that the court may judge what indulto, or duty, is proper to be laid on them, and what convoy is neceffkry for their fafety. See Galleons, and Register Ships.

FLOTSAM, Jetsam, Lagan, ana? Wreck. Thefe terms are generally defined together.

Flotfam, is when a fhip is funk, or otherwife perifhed, and the goods float Upon the fea.

Jet/am, is when a fhip is in danger of being loft, and, in order to fave by lightening her, fome goods are caft: into the fea, notwithstanding which (he afterwards perifhes.

Lagan, or ligan, are thofe heavy goods which are call into the fea, before a fliip is loft, in order to preferve them j and that they may be found again, (if providence permits) a buoy is generally fattened to them.

Wreck, fignifies in our law, fuch goods as, after a fhipwreck, are caft upon land by fea, and left there within fome county ; for they are not turecks, fo long as they remain at fea, in the jurifdiction of the admiralty.

The king thai] have flotfam, jet/am, and lagan, when the fhip' perifheth, or when the owners of the goods are not knowr!,; but when the fhip does not perifh, e contra* F. N. B. 122, 46 Edw. III.

A man may have flotfam and jetfam by the king's grant, and may have flotfam within the high and low-water mark by prefcription, as it appears by thofe of the Weft Countries, who prefcribe to have wreck in the fea, fo far as they may fee a Humber barrel. Coke 5. part. flol. 107. Coke 2. lnjhfol. 167.

By the grant ofzureei will pafs flotfam, jetfam, and lagan, when they are caft upon the land ; but, if they are not caft upon the land, the admiral hath jurifdiction, and not the common law, and they cannot be called wreck. Sir Hen. Conjlable's cafe. Coke 5. part. flol. 107.

By the common law all wrecks belonged to the crown, and therefore they are not chargeable with any cuftomsj becaufe goods corning into the kingdom by wreck, are not imported by any body, but caft aftiore by the wind and fea : but it was ufual to feize wrecks to the king's ufe, only when no owner could be found ; and, in that cafe, the property being in no man, it in confequence belongs to the king, as lord of the narrow feas.

XI. ANOTHER maritime revenue, and founded partly upon the ſame reaſon, is that of ſhipwrecks; which are alſo declared to be the king's property by the ſame prerogative ſtatute 17 Edw. II. C. 11. and were ſo, long before, at the common law. It is worthy obſervation, how greatly the law of wrecks has been altered, and the rigour of it gradually ſoftened, in favour of the diſtreſſed proprietors. Wreck, by the antient common law, was where any ſhip was loſt at ſea, and the goods or cargo were thrown upon the land; in which caſe theſe goods, ſo wrecked, were adjudged. to belong to the king: for it was held, that, by the loſs of the ſhip, all property was gone out of the original owner `[Dr & St. d. 2. c. 51]`. But this was undoubtedly adding ſorrow to ſorrow, and was conſonant narther to reaſon nor humanity. Wherefore it was firſt ordained by king Henry I, that if any perſon eſcaped alive out of the ſhip it ſhould be no wreck `[Spelm. Cod. apud. Wilkins. 305.]`; and afterwards king Henry II, by his charter `[26 May, A.D. 1174. 1 Rym. Foed. 36.]`, declared, that if on the coaſts of either England, Poictou, Oleron, or Gaſcony, any ſhip ſhould be diſtreſſed, and either man or beaſt ſhould eſcape or be found therein alive, the goods ſhould remain to the owners, if they claimed them within three months; but otherwiſe ſhould be eſteemed a wreck, and ſhould belong to the king, or other lord of the franchiſe. This was again confirmed with improvements by king Richard the firſt, who, in the ſecond year of his reign `[Rog. Hoved. in Ric. I]`, not only eſtabliſhed theſe conceſſions, by ordaining that the owner, if he was ſhipwrecked and eſcaped, *omnes res ſuas hberas et quietas haberet,* but alſo, that,

if he periſhed, his children, or in default of them his brethren.

and ſiſters, ſhould retain the property 3 and, in default of brother or ſiſter, then the goods ſhould remain to the king. And the law, ſo long after as the reign of Henry III, ſeems ſtill to have been guided by the ſame equitable proviſions. For then if a dog (for inſtance) eſcaped, by which the owner might be difcovered, or if any certain mark were ſet on the goods, by which they might be known again, it was held to be no wreck. And this is certainly moſt agreeable to reaſon; the rational claim of the king being only founded upon this, that the true owner cannot be aſcertained. But afterwards, in the ſtatute of Weſtminſter the firſt?, the law is laid down more agreeable to the charter of king Heney the ſecond: and upon that ſtatute hath ſtood the legal doctrine of wrecks to the preſent time. It enacts, that if any live thing eſcape (a man, a cat, or a dog; which, as in Bracton, are only put for examples e,) in this caſe, and, as it ſeems, in this caſe only, it is clearly nc not a legal wreck : but the theriff of the county -

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flotsam,_jetsam,_lagan_and_derelict
In terms of maritime law, the definition of flotsam pertains to goods that are floating on the surface of the water as the result of a wreck or an accident. As there is no clear way of defining ownership, one who discovers flotsam is allowed to claim it, unless someone claims ownership to the items in question.

Jetsam designates any cargo that is intentionally discarded from a ship or wreckage. Legally jetsam also floats, although floating is not part of the etymological meaning.[8] Generally, "jettisoning" connotes the action of throwing goods overboard to lighten the load of the ship if it is in danger of sinking.Per maritime law, one who discovers these artifacts is not required to return them to their rightful owner except in the case that the latter makes a legally abiding claim

[https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/flotsam-jetsam.html Flotsam may be claimed by the original owner, whereas jetsam may be claimed as property of whoever discovers it.]
Lagan  (also called "ligan") refers to goods that are cast overboard and are heavy enough to sink to the ocean floor, but are tied or otherwise linked to a floating marker, such as a buoy or cork, so that they can be found again by whoever marked the item. Lagan can also refer to large objects that are trapped within the sinking vessel. According to maritime law, a buoy, or otherwise floating object, constitutes as sufficient grounds in laying claim to an artifact. In other words, when faced with a lagan, one is required to return the artifact to its rightful owner
Derelict can refer to goods that have sunk to the ocean floor, relinquished willingly or forcefully by its owner, and thus abandoned, but which no one has any hope of reclaiming.In terms of maritime law, derelict is considered property abandoned on navigable waters which has no hope of being recovered, or sine spe recuperandi, and no expectation of it being returned to its owner

The book itself states that the High Court of Admiralty was established during the reign of Edward I (1272–1307), although more recent scholarship places the establishment at c. 1360 during the reign of Edward III.[1] Apart from the Rolls of Oléron, the earliest statute referred to is the Liber memorandorum (1338), of which a separate manuscript copy is available in the archives of the City of London.[1]



## The Island


```{admonition} The Village of Chale and the Wreckers, 1896
:class: dropdown

In Edward Boucher James, *Letters, archaeological and historical relating to the Isle of Wight*, 1896, [pp156-163](https://archive.org/details/lettersarchaeolo01jameuoft/page/156/mode/2up).

THE VILLAGE OF CHALE AND THE WRECKERS.

The village of 'green-swarded Chale,' with its scattered houses straggling irregularly for a mile along the road, is a place full of interest to the antiquary. It is one of the very few spots in the Isle of Wight the local name of which may be traced to a Celtic origin. In Domesday-book it is called Cela, and it may be referred to the Welsh word Celydd, which Owen Pughe defines to be 'a retreat, a woody shelter.' Celyddon, the plural of Celydd, was the name specifically given to the great forest-tract which spread from Loch Ness over the Highland wastes, and was called by the Romans Caledonia. There is some reason for believing that the woodlands on the chalk hills of the Chiltern range, which rise like rounded masses from the level of the wide and open plain, and stretch north of the Thames, were known to the Welsh by the name of Celyddon (Guest, *Orig. Celt.* vol. ii. p. 152). The derivation of the name of Chale, which Mr. Adams gives (*I. W.* p. 209) from 'Schiele,' the hollow of a cup or bowl, referring perhaps to the shape of the bay, or to the peculiar formation of the chines, is altogether fanciful. The narrow gorge of the valley of Chillerion, and Chilton Chine are probably both connected with this old Celtic word Celydd, though in their case the Anglo-Saxon word 'ton' or town has been affixed.

Chale supplies a very good specimen of the way in which parishes were formed in Enpland by the gradual result of circumstances. In ancient times its population received their religious services from the Benedictine monks of ihe Priory of Carisbrooke. So early as the reign of Henry I, a.d. 1114, Hugh de Vernun, nephew of Baldwin de Redvers, 'Lord of the Isle,' and founder of Quarr Abbey, to whom Chale belonged, finding the means of divine worship were inadequately supplied by the Carisbrooke Priory for the benefit of the people on his own domain, built a church, with a clergyman, who was paid by a charge on the estate of the lord of the manor, and whom the lord therefore presented to the benefice. In this way Chale became a parish. As this act tended to the advancement of religion, it was encouraged by the diocesan of the Isle of Wight, the Bishop of Winchester, who consecrated the place of worship thus established by Hugh de Vernun, and dedicated it to St. Andrew. The bishop also consented that the minister or incumbent should be resident in Chale and receive for his maintenance and for the use of his church there the tithes and offerings of the inhabitants, as well as any emolument or salary the founder annexed to it. This appears from the cartulary of Carisbrooke, quoted by Worsley (*Hist. I. W.* p. 254), where William Gifford, Bishop of Winchester, confirms an agreement made between the church of St. Mary of Carisbrooke, the minister of that church, and Hugh de Vernun, founder of the church of St. Andrew at Chale, on the day of the dedication of that church. The parson of Carisbrooke claimed the church of Chale as belonging to his parish; whereas Hugh de Vernun maintained that his tenants did not belong to the church of Carisbrooke, but by ancient usage could go to what church they pleased while living and bury their dead with equal liberty. In order however to terminate all animosity, he assigned to the church of Carisbrooke a moiety of the glebe land and tithes of burials and oblations, excepting those of his own house, which he reserved entire for maintaining the service and repairs of the church of Chale. The parson of Chale was bound to perform the whole service of his church; and on these conditions the parson of Carisbrooke testified his consent to the new church having a burying-ground. The parish of Chale was in this way entirely a lay-foundation, though the bishop signified his agreement by a legal instrument. In a church like that of Chale privately founded the two points upon which stress was mainly laid were (1) that it should be under the bishop's control; (2) that it should be sufficiently endowed. There was little fear that one belonging to the great family of De Redvers, who were generous benefactors of the church, would be guilty of meanness. Although no trace of Hugh de Vernun's original building remains, the church standing in a position singularly bleak and naked attests the pious founder's liberality.

'The outline of the church,' Mr. Venables says (*Guide I. W.* p. 281), 'is low and heavy. The perpendicular tower is very good — probably the work of the same architect with those of Carisbrooke and Gatcombe ... The plan is that so common in the island of two equal bodies with no constructional chancel.'

At Chale still lingers a relic of a curious feature of life in the Middle Ages, On St. Catherine's Down, 769 feet above the sea, there is undoubted evidence showing that in the fourteenth century a hermit had taken up his residence on the summit. A hermit was a religious personage who, without becoming a member of a monastic community, kept aloof from society. The hermit was a solitary in a cell, as distinguished from an anchorite, who was a solitary without any fixed dwelling-place. There is record in the registers of the Bishop of Winchester of the admission of one Walter Langstrell 'to the hermitage on the Down of Chale,' in October, 1312. Eleven years afterwards, in 1323, it appears from the same register that a chapel was erected on the spot by Walter de Godyton, who added an endowment for a chantry priest to sing masses for the soul of the founder and the souls of his ancestors, as also to provide lights at night to warn off ships from approaching too near this dangerous coast. The abode of this chantry-priest was nothing more than a half-timbered hut, containing two rooms, with no fireplace beyond a space of ground on which he burnt some dried turf, and with no chimney except a hole in the roof. At the Reformation, when some of the wheat was pulled up with the tares by the rude and ruthless hands of those who took part in that purifying but destructive process, the lights in this humble hermitage were put out, when the masses were forbidden. The chapel and the hermitage have entirely disappeared, but in 1753 their foundations were excavated by Sir Richard Worsley, and are. Canon Venables says, still to be traced. Worsley (*Hist. I. W.* p. 247) has a note which states that in the family papers 'is a small rude drawing of this chapel, when entire, from which it appears that it had only a body without a transept; the tower stood at the west end. A description of this tower, with four views of it in its decayed state, is seen in the *Gentleman's Magazine*, vol. xxvii. p. 176.

With the destruction of the chantry, the morals of the people of Chale, as regarded the treatment of shipwrecked marmers, became worse rather than better. Tomkins, in his *Tour in the Isle of Wight* (London, i 796), vol. i. p. 126, having described how, in his voyage round the island, 'they stood out in the channel to avoid the lurking rocks which abound in Chale Bay,' adds, 'Here our sailors told us of an inhuman stratagem said to have been practised on this coast for a number of years, but it has too much the air of fiction and improbability to be seriously credited. On every stormy night the inhabitants of the coast of Chale are said to have allured the unwary mariner to his destruction by fixing a lanthorn to the head of an old horse, one of whose forelegs had been previously tied up. The limping gait of the animal gave the lanthorn a kind of motion exactly similar to that of a ship's lanthorn, and led the deceived pilot on these fatal rocks, a prey to merciless plunderers, who it was said would not even scruple to dispatch any unfortunate individual that survived the wreck, in order to secure their booty more completely.'

Dreadful traditions of such barbarous contrivances as that mentioned by Tomkins still linger on other coasts besides that of the back of the Isle of Wight. The history of wrecking, as told by the different legislative enactments which have been passed to prevent this savage custom, is a dismal chapter in the records of human greediness and cruelty. 'Wreck,' so writes Blackstone in his *Commentaries*, book iv. part i, chap. vii. 'by the ancient common law, was where any ship was lost at sea and the goods and cargo were thrown upon the land, in which case these goods so wrecked were adjudged to belong to the king, for it was held that by the loss of the ship all properly was gone out of the original owner.' This revenue of wrecks was frequently granted out to lords of manors as a royal franchise. The lords of the Isle of Wight had this privilege, and thus in the 8th of Edward I we read that when Isabella de Fortibus was called upon before the Justices Itinerant to answer respecting the peculiar extent and nature of her dominion in the island she was, among other demands in the language of the Pleadings 'summoned to show to the lord the king by what warrant she claimed to have wreck of the sea.' And so also, according to Worsley (*Hist. I. W.* p. 245), when Sir Thomas Langford leased out the manor of Chale, reservation was made in this lease of wards, marriages, reliefs, escheats, wrecks of the sea, with the advowson of the church of Chale. In order to constitute a legal wreck, the goods must come to land. If they continue at sea, the law distinguishes them by the uncouth terms of 'jetsam,' 'flotsam,' and 'ligan.' Jetsam is where goods are cast into the sea, and there sink and remain under water; flotsam is where they continue swimming on the surface of the waves; ligan where they are sunk in the sea, but tied to a cork or buoy, in order to be found again. These are also the Crown's if no owner appears to claim them; but if any owner appears he is entitled to recover the possession.

Henry I, whose declining years were saddened by the loss of his son, William of Normandy, and two of the king's illegitimate children through shipwreck, a.d. 1120, was moved so far as to ordain that if any person escaped alive out of the ship it should be no wreck. Henry II made a feeble enlargement of this scant mercy, and by his charter declared that if on the coasts of either England, Poitou, Oleron, or Gascony, any ship should be distressed, and either man or beast escape or be found thereon alive, the goods should remain to the owners if they claimed them within three months, but otherwise should be esteemed a wreck and belong to the king, or other lord of the franchise. This was again improved by Richard I, and the law as laid down by Bracton in the reign of Henry III was a still further improvement. In A. D. 1275, when at the Parliament held at Westminster several reformatory statutes were issued, further progress was made in the maritime law relating to wrecks and wreckage. In a. d. 1257, when under Edward III, who has been called the father of English commerce, the staple was regulated by statute, and the five great commodities of the kingdom were allowed to be dealt in for exportation only by a corporation called the merchants of the staple and in certain specified towns where they were disposed of to foreigners, it was also enacted that if any ship be lost on the shore and the goods come to land (which cannot, says the statute, be called a wreck) they shall presently be delivered to the merchants, paying only a reasonable reward to those that saved and preserved them, which shall be called 'salvage.'

In spite of all this legislation the barbarous practice of wrecking prevailed to the disgrace of the population on our sea-coasts. The fate of a vessel near in shore and driving before a gale with people on board likely to perish ought to touch every human heart in one way only; but in place of creating a feeling of sympathy with the sufferers, it put the seafaring population on the Isle of Wight and elsewhere upon calculations of their own profit from the sad catastrophe.

Often in remote times has an unfortunate crew been seduced to its fate upon the rocks in thick weather, and then not seldom have the master, the mate, and the sailors, too few and too feeble to fight for their lives, escaping from the breakers, been hurried to their end by the bludgeons of the wreckers. Dead men tell no tales and claim no property. Instances have occurred when some fearful old woman has been known to kneel upon the chest of a sailor who had been dragged upon the beach out of the way of the surf and covering his mouth with her cloak carry off his money which he wore about his person. Not only tradition has handed down these atrocities; there is more trustworthy evidence that such things were done even towards the end of the last century. The preamble of an Act of Parliament is generally the summary of the arguments for the necessity of the Bill. The preamble of a Bill for the repression of crime may therefore be taken as the expression of the national conviction that such crimes exist at the time. In the reign of George II a new Act was passed which recited — 'That notwithstanding the good and salutary laws now in being against plundering and destroying vessels in distress, and against taking away shipwrecked, lost, and stranded goods, still many wicked enormities had been practised to the disgrace of the nation.' Therefore certain provisions were enacted to the effect that death was to be the punishment for hanging out false lights; also for those who killed or prevented the escape of shipwrecked persons; also for stealing goods from a wreck, whether there be any living creature on board or not. Acts of Parliament in following years showed the impress of the more merciful spirit of legislation which began to prevail. The punishment of theft from a wreck was reduced to imprisonment, while penal servitude for life was made the penalty for a new development of crime, the wilfully scuttling or setting on fire or wrecking a ship for the purpose of defrauding insurance offices or owners.

Upon our coasts, even at the beginning of this century, this plea for plundering a wrecked vessel was put forward, that it was done only at the expense of the underwriters, who, it was urged, made enormous profits in their business by calculating on these chances and squaring their rales of insurance accordingly. Such sophistical arguments come easily enough from the lips of those who saw no harm in smuggling, and thought it no sin to cheat the revenue.

The lifeboat movement has contributed greatly towards bringing about an improvement in the tone of public opinion. The flashing lights from the lifeboat stations tell of coming rescue to the homeward-bound ship, which has come suddenly to destruction on our dangerous coast, instead of luring it on to be the prey of wreckers. The mission of the gallant crews of the lifeboat is to save life, and their courage is glorified by mercy. There are still, as of old, keen eyes watching the signs of the coming storm, as they see in the dim distance the struggling ship making towards the land, but those eyes are not lighted up with the greed of the vulture watching for its prey; hardy resolute men are on the look-out, eagerly watching the labouring vessel from the shore, and preparing to launch the lifeboat, should the necessity arise. Let all honour be paid to the branch of the Lifeboat Institution which has been established in this Island, but do not let us forget Walter de Godyton and his primitive lighthouse on St. Catherine's Down, nor the solitary chantry priest kindling the lamp, whose faint gleams were in old days blessed by the anxious mariner. None of the excitement which stirs the heart of the coxswain and his crew in the lifeboat was felt in the bleak abode of that man of God; he had sacrificed everything on earth which most of us hold dear; a drearier life we cannot conceive; let us not then grudge the due meed of honour and of respect to this lonely watcher o'er the deep, as night after night he lit his beacon, and bent his knee in prayer for 'those in danger of the sea.'

February 5, 1887.
