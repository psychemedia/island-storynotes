Statutes of King Edwards the First, Anno 3d Edward I, AD 1275

> IV. CONCERNING Wrecks of the Sea, it is agreed, That where a Man, a Dog, or a Cat escape quick out of the ship, that such Ship nor Barge, nor any thing within them, shall be adjudged Wreck; but the Goods shall be saved and kept by view of the sheriff, Coroner, or the King's Bailiff, and delivered into the hands of such as are of the Town where the Goods were found; so that if any sue for those Goods, and after prove `[can prove]` that they were his, `[or his Lord's]` or perished in his keeping, within a Year and a Day, they shall be restored to him without delay; and if not, they shall remain to the King, and be seised by the sheriffs, Coroners, and Bailiffs `[Sheriff and Coroner]`, and shall be delivered to them of the Town, which shall answer before the Justices of the Wreck belonging to the King; And where Wreck belongeth to another than to the King, he shall have it in like manner. And he that otherwise doth, and thereof be attainted, shall be awarded to Prison, and make Fine at the King's Will, and shall yield Damages also. And if a Bailiff do it and it be disallowed by the Lord, `[and be disavowed of his Lord]` and the Lord will not pretend any Title thereunto, `[will not discharge him thereof]` the Bailiff shall answer, if he have whereof; and if he have not whereof, the Lord shall deliver his Bailiff's Body to the King.



https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flotsam,_jetsam,_lagan_and_derelict
In terms of maritime law, the definition of flotsam pertains to goods that are floating on the surface of the water as the result of a wreck or an accident. As there is no clear way of defining ownership, one who discovers flotsam is allowed to claim it, unless someone claims ownership to the items in question.

Jetsam designates any cargo that is intentionally discarded from a ship or wreckage. Legally jetsam also floats, although floating is not part of the etymological meaning.[8] Generally, "jettisoning" connotes the action of throwing goods overboard to lighten the load of the ship if it is in danger of sinking.Per maritime law, one who discovers these artifacts is not required to return them to their rightful owner except in the case that the latter makes a legally abiding claim

[https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/flotsam-jetsam.html Flotsam may be claimed by the original owner, whereas jetsam may be claimed as property of whoever discovers it.]
Lagan  (also called "ligan") refers to goods that are cast overboard and are heavy enough to sink to the ocean floor, but are tied or otherwise linked to a floating marker, such as a buoy or cork, so that they can be found again by whoever marked the item. Lagan can also refer to large objects that are trapped within the sinking vessel. According to maritime law, a buoy, or otherwise floating object, constitutes as sufficient grounds in laying claim to an artifact. In other words, when faced with a lagan, one is required to return the artifact to its rightful owner
Derelict can refer to goods that have sunk to the ocean floor, relinquished willingly or forcefully by its owner, and thus abandoned, but which no one has any hope of reclaiming.In terms of maritime law, derelict is considered property abandoned on navigable waters which has no hope of being recovered, or sine spe recuperandi, and no expectation of it being returned to its owner

CHAP. V.

Of Wrecks, in whom the Property is vested by the Civil Law; Of the King's Prerogative in Relation to Wrecks; And of the Admiralty; Of Flotsam, Jetsam, and Lagan, &c.

IN ancient Times, all Wrecks belong'd to the Crown; but by stat. 3 Ed. 1. it is ordained, that when either a Man, a Dog, or a Cat, or any Thing escapes alive out of the ship, there shall be no Wreck, but the same shall be kept a Year and a Day by the sheriff, to be restored to any Person that can prove a Property in the Goods within that Time; and if no Body comes, then the same is to be forfeited to the King, or rather the Lord High Admiral, to whom they are granted by Patent.

But it was usual to seize Wrecks as forfeited to the King, only when no Owner could be found; for the Property being in that Case in no Man, it must of Consequence belong to the King, as Lord of the narrow seas, which he is obliged to scower of Pyrates, &c. and the Product of Wrecks was ordained to contribute to the Charge. And *Bracton* says, there shall be no Wreck where the Owner comes and makes Claim to the Goods, without Limitation of Time.

If a ship be ready to sink, and all the Men therein, for the Preservation of their Lives, quit the ship, and afterwards she perishes; if any of the Men are saved, and come to Land, the Goods are not lost.

A ship on the sea was chased by an Enemy; the Men therein, for the security of their Lives, quitted the Ship; the Enemy took the Ship, and spoil'd her of her Goods and Tackle, and turned her to sea; by stress of Weather she is cast on Land, where it happen'd her Men safely arriv'd. It was resolved, that the ship was no Wreck. 5 R. 2. Fishlake's Case. Co. 2. Inst. fol. 167.

Where a Wreck happens by any Fault or Negligence in the Master or Mariners, the Master must make Good the Loss; but if the same was occasioned by the Act of God, or done to avoid an Enemy, or Pyrate, &c. there he shall be excus'd. And if the Master, or any of the Mariners lie ashore, and the ship during their Absence, perisheth, whether by Night or by Day, the Master or Mariners, so lying ashore, shall sustain the Damage; and those who remain'd in the ship, shall be excused. Leg. Rhod.

If a ship and Goods perish in the sea, and the Owners abandon her, so that she becomes a mere Derelict; in such Case, the first Person that takes Possession of her, and recovers any Part of the Lading, gains a Property by the Laws of Nations. And if a ship perishes only, and the Goods are safe; in that Case, by the *Rhodian* Law, the Goods ought to pay a Proportion of a fifth or tenth Penny, according to the Difficulty in saving the Goods; (wherein rich Goods, such as Gold and silver, silk, &c. pay less than Goods of great Weight and Cumber, they being in less Danger) for the salvage.

Owners claiming a Wreck, must make sufficient Proof of their Title within the Year and Day; and they are to do it by their Marks or Cocquets, by the Book of Customs, or the Testimony of reputable Men; and if the Wreck be taken by the King, the Party may sue out a Commission to hear and determine by the Oaths of twelve Men; or he may bring his Action at Law. F. N. B. Fol. 12.

When Goods wreck'd are perishable, the sheriff may sell them within the Year and Day, and the sale shall be good; but he must dispose of them for the best Advantage, and account with the Owners. And by the Laws of France, all ships and Persons belonging to them, that shall be cast ashore by Tempest, or otherwise, upon the Coasts of that Kingdom, and every Thing that has escap'd shipwreck, is declared to be taken into the Protection of the King.

By the Civil Law, if any Person steal shipwreck'd Goods, they shall pay four-fold to the Owner, if pursued within a Year and a Day, and as much to the Prince, or his Admiral; and so careful is this Law in requiring Restitution, that the very stealing of a Nail, or the Worth thereof, oblig'd the Thief to the Restitution of all the remaining Goods. And by the Emperor Antonius was made a Law, That such Criminals should be banish'd for three Years, if they were of high Rank; and those that were base and ignoble, were to be scourged and sent to the Gallies. By the same Law, if any Man should prevent Assistance to shipwreck'd Persons, he was to be punish'd as a Murderer; and the like Punishment was ordain'd for those who should, by Treachery, put forth any Lanthorn or Light, with Intention to subject them to Danger or shipwreck. Hence it is that Fishers are forbidden to fish with Lights in the Night.

If Goods are wreck'd on shore, and the Lord, having Power, takes them, he shall not pay Custom, neither by the Common Law, nor by the statute Law; for at the Common Law, wreck'd Goods could not be charg'd with Custom, by Reason the Wreck is wholly the King's, and he could not have a Custom out of what was all his own. Stat. West. 1. Shep versus Gosnold. Hill. 23 & 24 Car. 2. Rot. 615.

And Wines or other Goods, coming or brought into the Kingdom by Wreck, are not imported by any Body, but by the Wind and sea; for such Goods are destitute of a Proprietor, until the Law appoints one: And wreck'd Goods are not brought into the Kingdom, (being cast ashore) as Merchandise for sale. Goods drown'd, or lost in passing a Ferry, a great River, or Arm of the sea, are not to be said exported, although they be carried to sea.

By stat. 12 Annae c. 18. it is enacted, That sheriffs, Justices of Peace, Head Officers of Towns, &c. and Officers of the Customs, in all Places where a ship shall be in Danger of being stranded, or run on shore, upon Application to them made on Behalf of the Commander of the ship, shall command the Constables to assemble as many Men as shall be necessary for the Preservation of the ship. And if there be any ships of War lying at Anchor near the Place, then the Officers of such ships are to send forth their Boats, and as many Men as they can spare, to her Assistance, under the Penalty of 100*l.* to be recover'd by the Officer of the ship in Distress.

When a ship is preserv'd by these Means, the Persons who assisted therein, shall, within thirty Days after, be paid a reasonable Reward for the same, by the Officer of the ship, or Merchant; and in Default thereof, the ship or Goods shall remain in the Custody of the Officers of the Customs, as a security.

Persons entering such ship in Distress, without Leave from the Commander, Constable, &c. or molesting any one in the salvage, shall make double satisfaction within twenty Days. And if any Goods are carried off from such ship, and found on any Person, if they are not delivered to the Owner on Demand, such Person shall be liable to pay treble the Value of the Goods.

If any Officer of the Customs, or his Deputy, abuse the Trust reposed in him, and shall be convicted thereof, he shall forfeit treble Damages to the Party grieved, and be incapable of any Employment in the Customs.

And by this statute to make a Hole in the Bottom, side, or in any Part of the ship; or do any Thing tending to the Loss of the ship, is made Felony, without the Benefit of Clergy.

This Act is not to extend to deprive the Crown, or any Grantee, of any Right or Claim to any Wreck or Goods that shall be *Jetsam*, *Flotsam*, or *Lagan*.

*Flotsam, Jetsam, &c.*

*Flotsam*, *Jetsam*, and *Lagan*, are Goods on or in the sea, and belong to the King or Lord Admiral,

*Flotsam* is when a ship is sunk or cast away, and the Goods float upon the sea.

*Jetsam* is where the ship is in Danger of sinking, and the Goods are cast into the sea for the lightening of the ship, and notwithstanding the ship perisheth.

*Lagan* is when heavy Goods are cast into the sea before the Perishing of the ship; and being sunk, the Master or Mariners fasten a Buoy, or other sea-Mark, to them, whereby they may more easily be directed to the Place where they lie.

The King shall have *Flotsam*, *Jetsam*, and *Lagan*, when the ship perisheth, or when the Owners of the Goods are not known, but not otherwise. F. N. B. 122.

A Man may have *Flotsam* and *Jetsam* by the King's Grant; and may have *Lagan* within the high and low Water-Mark by Prescription, as it appears in the Ve- Country, where the Lords of Manors prescribe to have Wreck in the sea, so far as they can see a Humber-Barrel.

*Wreccum Maris* are such Goods only as are cast and left upon the Land by the sea.

By the Grant of Wreck will pass *Flotsam*, *Jetsam*, and *Lagan*, when they are cast upon the Land; but if they are not cast upon the Land, the Admiral hath Jurisdiction, and not the Common Law, and they cannot be said to be Wreck.

King Edward the second, in the first Year of his Reign, granted by Charter the Castle of Carisbrook, with all the Lands and Tenements, in the Isle of Vight, then formerly belonging to the Countess of Albemarle, to his Favourite Peter de Gaveston and Margaret his Wife, and the Heirs of their two Bodies begotten, with several other Castles and Lands; but they being soon after reseized into the King's Lands, he granted this Castle, with all its services, and all his Lands in that Isle, to Edward his son, and his Heirs, Kings of England; and afterwards, for the ascertaining what did of Right belong to the same Castle, a Writ of Inquisition was issued out, by which it was found *inter alia, quod wreccum Maris, pertinens ad dictum Castrum*, &c.

So that without special Words in the Patent granted to the Lord High Admiral, the Wreck of this Isle will not pass.

*An Affidavit that a ship is cast away.*

A. B. of, &c. Mariner, lately hir'd in the good ship, &c. in a Voyage to, &c. maketh Oath, That on, &c. last past, near the Cape of, &c. the said ship, proceeding in her said Voyage, was cast away in a storm, whereby the said ship, the Cargo, and all the Goods on Board perished, and were intirely lost: And that only the Master and, &c. of the Men were saved, the rest of the ship's Crew being drown'd. *And* this Deponent farther deposeth, That neither he, this Deponent, nor any other, to his Use, hath received, or doth expect to receive any Benefit of or by the Goods so lost, or any Part thereof, by any Ways or Means whatever.

*A Testimonial for a Person suffering shipwreck.*

TO all Constables, &c. Greeting, Whereas A. B. the Bearer hereof, aged about, &c. having this Day been before me C. D. Esq; one of his Majesty's Justices of the Peace for the County of, &c. and made it appear, that on, &c. last, he the said A. B. being on Board the ship called, Ge. suffer'd. shipwreck on the Coast of, &c. and with much ado got to Land at, &c. And the said A. B. by Reason of his Indisposition, occasion'd by the said shipwreck, is become unable to travel to his Place of settlement, or to relieve himself in his Journey thither. These are therefore to require and desire you not only to permit the said A. B. to travel to, &c. the Place of his Birth, without Molestation, but also to assist him in his Conveyance thither, and in the necessary Expences for his Relief in his Journey. Given, &c.

Wrecking - oleron

Article XXV

If a ship or other vessel arriving at any place, and making in towards a port or harbor, set out her flag, or give any other sign to have a pilot come aboard, or a boat to tow her into the harbor, the wind or tide being contrary, and a contract be made for piloting the said vessel into the said harbor accordingly; but by reason of an unreasonable and accursed custom, in some places, that the third or fourth part of the ships that are lost, shall accrue to the lord of the place where such sad casualties happen, as also the like proportion to the salvors, and only the remainder to the master, merchant and mariners: the persons contracting for the pilotage of the said vessel, to ingratiate themselves with their lords, and to gain to themselves a part of the ship and lading, do like faithless and treacherous villains, sometimes even willingly, and out of design to ruin ship and goods, guide and bring her upon the rocks, and then feigning to aid, help and assist, the now distressed mariners, are the first in dismembering and pulling the ship to pieces; purloining and carrying away the lading thereof contrary to all reason and good conscience: and afterwards that they may be the more welcome to their lord, do with all speed post to his house with the sad narrative of this unhappy disaster; whereupon the said lord, with his retinue appearing at the places, takes his share; the salvors theirs; and what remains the merchant and mariners may have. But seeing this is contrary to the law of God, our edict and determination is, that notwithstanding any law or custom to the contrary, it is said and ordained, the said lord of that place, salvors, and all others that take away any of the said goods, shall be accursed and excommunicated, and punished as robbers and thieves, as formerly hath been declared. But all false and treacherous pilots shall be condemned to suffer a most rigorous and unmerciful death; and high gibbets shall be erected for them in the same place, or as high as conveniently may be, where they so guided and brought any ship or vessel to ruin as aforesaid, and thereon these accursed pilots are with ignominy and much shame to end their days; which said gibbets are to abide and remain to succeeding ages on that place, as a visible caution to other ships that shall afterwards sail thereby.

Article XXVI

If the lord of any place be so barbarous, as not only to permit such inhuman people, but also to maintain and assist them in such villainies, that he may have a share in such wrecks, the said lord shall be apprehended, and all his goods confiscated and sold, in order to make restitution to such as of right it appertaineth; and himself to be fastened to a post or stake in the midst of his own mansion house, which being fired at the four corners, all shall be burnt together, the walls thereof shall be demolished, the stones pulled down, and the place converted into a market place for the sale only of hogs and swine to all posterity.

Article XXIX

If any ship or other vessel sailing to and fro, and coasting the seas, as well in the way of merchandizing, as upon the fishing account, happen by some misfortune through the violence of the weather to strike herself against the rocks, whereby she becomes so bruised and broken, that there she perishes, upon what coasts, country or dominion soever; and the master, mariners, merchant or merchants, or any one of these escape and come safe to land; in this case the lord of that place or country, where such misfortune shall happen, ought not to let, hinder, or oppose such as have so escaped, or such to whom the said ship or vessel, and her lading belong, in using their utmost endeavors for the preservation of as much thereof as may possibly be saved. But on the contrary, the lord of that place or country, by his own interest, and by those under his power and jurisdiction, ought to be aiding and assisting to the said distressed merchants or mariners, in saving their shipwrecked goods, and that without the least embezzlement, or taking any part thereof from the right owners; but, however, there may be a remuneration or consideration for salvage to such as take pains therein, according to right reason, a good conscience, and as justice shall appoint; notwithstanding what promises may in that case have been made to the salvors by such distressed merchants and mariners, as is declared in the fourth article of these laws; and in case any shall act contrary hereunto, or take any part of the said goods from the said poor, distressed, ruined, undone, shipwrecked persons, against their wills, and without their consent, they shall be declared to be excommunicated by the church, and ought to receive the punishment of thieves; except speedy restitution be made by them: nor is there any custom or statute whatsoever, that can protect them against the aforesaid penalties, as is said in the 26th article of these laws.

Article XLVI

If any ship, or other vessel, by any casualty or misfortune happens to be wrecked and perish, in that case, the pieces of the hulk of the vessel, as well as the lading thereof, ought to be reserved and kept in safety for them to whom it belonged before such disaster happened, notwithstanding any custom to the contrary. And all takers, partakers, or consenters of, or to the said wreck, if they be bishops, prelates or clerks, they shall be deposed and deprived of their benefices respectively; and if they be laymen they shall incur the penalties aforesaid. De his autem quos diripuisse probatum sit, praesides ut de latronibus, gravem sententiam dicere convenit. l. ne quid. l. quo Naufrag. D. Incendio, ruina, & naufragio. l navigia, C. furtis. The penalties aforesaid are in the 25th, 26th and 29th articles.

Article XLVII

This is to be understood only when the said ship or vessel so wrecked, did not exercise the trade of pillaging, and when the mariners thereof were not pirates, sea-rovers, or enemies to our holy Catholic faith; but if they are found to be either the one or the other, every man may then deal with such as with rogues, and despoil them of their goods without any punishment for so doing.



shipwreck - Oleron

Article XXX

If a ship or other vessel entering into harbor, happens by misfortune to be broken and perish, and the master, mariners and merchants, which were on board her, be all drowned; and if the goods thereof be driven ashore, or remain floating on the sea, without being sought after by those to whom they belong, they being ignorant of this said disaster, and knowing nothing thereof in this most lamentable case, the lord of that place or country ought to send persons to save the said goods, which he ought to secure and to put into safe custody; and give the relations of the deceased persons who were drowned, notice of it, and to satisfy for the salvage thereof, not out of his own purse, but of the goods saved, according to the hazards run, and the pains taken therein; and what remains must be kept in safe custody for one year or more; and if in that time they to whom the said goods appertain, do not appear and claim the same, and the said year be fully expired, he may publicly sell and dispose thereof to such as will give most, and with the monies proceeding of the sale thereof, he ought to give among the poor, and for portions to poor maids, and other charitable uses, according to reason and good conscience. But if he assumes the said goods either in whole or in part unto himself, he shall incur the curse and malediction of our mother the holy church, with the aforesaid pains and penalties, without ever obtaining remission, unless he make satisfaction.

Article XXXI

If a ship or other vessel happens to be lost by striking on some shore, and the mariners thinking to save their lives, reach the shore, in hope of help, and instead thereof it happens, as it often does, that in many places they meet with people more barbarous, cruel, and inhuman than mad dogs, who to gain their monies, apparel, and other goods, do sometimes murder and destroy these poor distressed seamen; in this case, the lord of that country ought to execute justice on such wretches, to punish them as well corporally as pecuniarily, to plunge them in the sea till they be half dead, and then to have them drawn forth out of the sea, and stoned to death.

?Flotsom and jetsam?

Article XXXII - oleron

If by reason of tempestuous weather, it be thought expedient, for the lightening of any ship or vessel at sea, or riding at anchor in any road, to cast part of the lading overboard, and it be done accordingly for the common safety, though the said goods so ejected, and cast over-board, do become his that can first possess himself thereof, and carry them away: nevertheless, it is here to be further understood, that this holds true only in such cases, as when the master, merchant, and mariners have so ejected or cast out the said goods, as that they give over all hope or desire of ever recovering them again, and so leave them as things utterly lost and given over by them, without ever making any enquiry or pursuit after them: in which case only the first occupant becomes the lawful proprietor thereof.

Article XXXIII

If a ship, or any other vessel, hath cast overboard several goods or merchandises, which are in chests well locked and made fast; or books well clasped and shut close, that they may not be damnified by salt water; in such cases it is to be presumed, that they who did cast such goods overboard, do still retain an intention, hope, and desire of recovering the same: for which reason, such as shall happen to find such things, are obliged to make restitution thereof to him who shall make a due enquiry after them; or put them to pious uses, according to his conscience and the advice of some prudent neighbor.

Article VIII

If a vessel be laden to sail from Bordeaux to Caen, or any other place, and it happens that a storm overtakes her at sea, so violent, that she cannot escape without casting some of the cargo overboard for lightening the vessel, and preserving the rest of the lading, as well as the vessel itself then the master ought to say, Gentlemen, We must throw part of the goods overboard; and, if there are no merchants to answer him, or if those that are there approve of what he says by their silence, then the master may do as he thinks fit; and if the merchants are not pleased with his throwing over any part of the merchandise, and forbid him, yet the master ought not to forbear casting out so many of the goods as he shall see to be for the common good and safety; he and the third part of his mariners making oath on the Holy Evangel-ists, when they arrive at their port of discharge, that he did it only for the preservation of the vessel, and the rest of the lading that remains yet in her. And the wines, or other goods, that were cast overboard, ought to be valued or prized according to the just value of the other goods that arrive in safety. And when these shall be sold, the price or value thereof ought to be divided livre a livre among the merchants. The master may compute the damage his vessel has sustained, or reckon the freight of the goods thrown overboard at his own choice. If the master does not make it appear that he and his men did the part of able seamen, then neither he nor they shall have any thing. The mariners also ought to have one tun free, and another divided by cast of the dice, according as it shall happen, and the merchants in this case may lawfully put the master to his oath.

Article XLIII

In all other things found by the sea side, which have formerly been in the possession of some one or other, as wines, oil, and other merchandize, although they have been cast overboard, and left by the merchants, and so ought to appertain to him that first finds the same; yet herein also the custom of the country is to be observed as well as in the case of fish. But if there be a presumption that these were the goods of some ship that perished, then neither the said lord, nor finder thereof, shall take any, to convert any part of it to their own use; but as has been said, distribute the money it produces amongst the poor and needy.

Article XXXIV

If any man happens to find any thing in the sea, or in the sand on the shore, in floods or in rivers, if it be precious stones, fishes, or any treasure of the sea, which never belonged to any man in point of property, it belongs to the first finder.

Article XXXVI

If any going along the sea-shore to fish, or otherwise, happens to find gold or silver, he shall be bound to make restitution thereof, deducting for his own pains; or if he be poor he may keep it to himself that is, if he knows not to whom to restore it; yet he shall give notice of the place where he found it, to the neighborhood and parts next adjacent, and advise with his superiors, who ought to weigh and take into consideration the property of the finder, and then to give him such advice as is consonant to good conscience.





https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Book_of_the_Admiralty
a compilation of English admiralty law created over the course of several English monarchs' reigns, including the most important decisions of the High Court of Admiralty. Its starting point is the Rolls of Oléron.

The book itself states that the High Court of Admiralty was established during the reign of Edward I (1272–1307), although more recent scholarship places the establishment at c. 1360 during the reign of Edward III.[1] Apart from the Rolls of Oléron, the earliest statute referred to is the Liber memorandorum (1338), of which a separate manuscript copy is available in the archives of the City of London.[1]

The law of Maritime Jetison, for instance, as set forth in the thirty-eighth chapter of the compilation of Laws published in the fourth year of William the Conqueror (A.D. 1070) as the Laws of King Edward the Confessor, is the affirmation of a rule by which questions of maritime jetison were then governed, which is not identical with the ancient Law of Rome (Digest, 1. xiv. t. 11), but accords with a more modern usage, such as we find subsequently reduced into writing in the Rolls ofOlero

1313 wreck of French cargo vessel which stranded in Chale Bay en route from Tonnay-Charente and Bayonne to England and/or Picardie with wine. Constructed of wood, she was a sailing vessel. This is the vessel which inspired the building of st. Catherine's Oratory, the so-called "Pepper Pot" lighthouse (459794), as restitution for the wine taken by local inhabitants from the wreck.

Carried 174 tuns of white wine belonging to the Duchy of Aquitaine, Regimus de Depe, owner. ship lost on the sunday after Easter, with many survivors. Many casks of wine removed from the beach by local men. Complaint by the merchants, viz Elie Byger, Frederick Campanare and Bernard Columers, all of Gascony, resulted in the case being the first heard at southampton on 8-JUN-1313. It was claimed that 154 tuns had reached the Isle of Wight beaches, of which much was stolen, the loss to the merchants being £1,000. There was also some action taken concerning the wreck and sir Goditon and the pepper-box lighthouse on the Isle of Wight. Quarr Abbey account names the ship as the BLEssED MARY. (1)
A ballad reads: '...she carried in her hold a delicious wine... white wine it was, the finest, and what's more, there were one hundred tuns and seventy four. Now soon, as water crashed upon her deck, the brave sT MARY was a total wreck.' (Ballads of the Isle of Wight) (1)

In 1313 occurred the most famous of the island's medieval wrecks, the ST MARY of Bayonne. The ship of the BLESSED MARY was sailing from Bayonne in Gascony with a cargo of 174 barrels of white wine from the Duchy of Aquitaine. she was bound for Picardy, where the wine would be delivered to the monastery of Livers. However, the MARY was blown off course, far to the north, and on the 22-APR-1313 she was driven ashore in Chale Bay, in the remote and wild wastes of the 'Back of Wight'. (2)

On the sunday after Easter 1313, which was 22nd April, a wreck occurred under Chale. It was a ship from Bayonne, called the ship of BLESSED MARY, which had been loaded at Tonnay, on the Charente in Aquitaine, with a cargo of 174 barrels of white wine. There were many survivors, but most of the casks of wine were removed from beaches by local men. As the owners Elie Byger, Frederick Campanare and Bernard Columers were from Gascony, the King wished justice to be done to the complaint, especially as they were his subjects at that date. The case was first heard at southampton 8th June 1313, then Winchester 20th July 1313 and finally restitution and damages were finally settled at the court held on Wednesday in the first week of Lent, 22nd February 1314. (3)
Walter de Goditon and his cronies, when standing before a jury in southampton on 8th June 1313, had audaciously removed some 57 casks of white wine from the SAINTE MARIE after she had been wrecked in Chale Bay. (4)

'1314, May 26, Newcastle-upon-Tyne. The like `[commission of oyer and terminer]` to Master John de Everesdon and John de Westecote, on complaint by John Besecu that, whereas a ship of Remigius de Depe, merchant of Bayonne, freighted with white wines in the duchy [of Aquitaine] to be carried to the ports of Flanders by the said Remigius de Depe and his men, was driven ashore by tempest near Chale in the Isle of Wight and wrecked, by which a great part of the wine was endangered, and the said Remigius de Depe proved that the ship and wines were his, and afterwards obtained that proof and made his profit therein, Robert de Harslade, John le Walshe and Reymund Arnald having made a plot to injure him, and conspired with certain others at Newport in the same island that Elias Byger, Fretheric de Campane and Bernard de Columiners, unknown men, should lay claim to the ship and wines, and that the said John Besecu should be indicted of having committed a theft of these wines from them, as if those wines had been their property when they were not, and as if Remigius de Depe had not proved that the ship and wines were his, procured his capture and detention for a long time in prison at Winchester until according to the law and custom of the realm he was acquitte: the justices are to enquire fully into these allegations by oath of good men of the county of southampton. By fine of 40s.' (7)

NB: There is a record for a French cargo vessel which was reported in the Privy Council Papers in 1314 as stranded in Chale Bay, en route from Bayonne to Flanders with wine. Enough of the details are consistent with the ST MARY to suspect that this may be an alternative account of the same vessel, particularly as wrecks tend to turn up in state Papers several months or even years after the initial incident, and this would appear to sound close to the account in source (6). Alternatively, there may be two wrecks in question, the ST MARY, which was definitively bound for England, according to source (5), and the other vessel bound for Flanders. Byger, Campan[ar]e and Colum[in]ers appear to have been involved in the former, (5) and appear as fraudulent claimants in the latter (7). It is therefore possible that these may be one and the same wreck, but it is also possible that if they had not obtained restitution for their wreck, they instead claimed a stake in another wreck nearby.

ship owner: Regimus de Depe (1); Remigius de Depe (7)
