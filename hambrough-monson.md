 # Ardlamont Murder

I discovered this tale, in a roundabout way, from a notice of a strange occurrence at the end of the 19th century that took place, suposedly, in what is now [*The Ferryman*](https://ferrymanlymington.com/) pub, at Lymington.

```{admonition} Tragedy — In the Tap Room

```

> Way back in 1893, on September 5th, there was a shooting tragedy in this, the "Waggon and Horses" Inn, Walhampton, of which a local gamekeeper, 38 years old Henry Card, who lived at Snooke's farm, was the victim. He was in the service of Mr. J.P. Heseltine of Walhampton House, a former High Sheriff of the county of Southampton.
>
> The tragedy occurred at the time of the mystery of what was known as the Ardlamont Shooting Case, which set a problem as to whether Lieutenant Hambrough, (who was buried at Ventnor, I. O. W.), could have shot himself from behind. There was news that Lieutenant Hambrough's body was to be exhumed, and Lymington was sharing the widespread public interest in the case. The topic arose when Henry Card walked into the Tap-room of the "Waggon" shortly before midday and ordered a "pint". He carried a double-barrelled gun which, although apparently believed to be empty, was shown by subsequent events to have been fully loaded.
>
> It was a Mr. John Bligh, a London visitor to the inn, who raised the subject of the Adlamont case. He read of it, from a newspaper, to Mr. Card. And when another customer in the bar remarked that an old keeper in Scotland had said that it was impossible for Lieutenant Hambrough to have shot himself, Henry Card disagreed.
>
> What then happened was described by Mr. Bligh at an inquest, which was held here, in the inn, on Sept. 7th, 1893. He said that Mr. Card invited him to try the experiment, saying, "There's my gun; it is empty." Mr. Bligh did not accept, and Mr. Card put down the dog he was nursing and picked up the gun. Mr. Bligh stated that he heard Mr. Card cock the gun and saw him eventually place the gun behind his back with his right hand close to the trigger and the muzzle pointing towards his head. "Then he fired and the explosion came", said Mr. Bligh. Mr. Card, he went on, then put the gun down on the table before falling to the floor.
>
> The game-keeper had received mortal head-wounds. Two doctors were summoned to him, but, as the Press of the day related, early that afternoon, "the poor fellow breathed his last.
>
> "The tragic circumstances surrounding his death," stated the Press, "have evoked the deepest sympathy towards his sorrowing widow, who has thus suddenly been left to battle with the work alone for herself and nine orphans left behind."

So what was the *Ardlamont Shooting Case*, aka the *Ardlament Mystery*, or the *Monson Case*?

The story begins with newspaper reports in mid-August, 1893, of what appears to be an unfortunate shooting accident:

YOUNG GENTLEMAN SHOT DEAD IN BUTE.

A sad shooting fatality happened on Thursday the estate Ardlament, some distance from Tighnabruaich. Mr Hambro *[sic]*, a young gentleman of 23 years, who is believed to have been a banker in America, and who was joint-tenant of the Ardlamont shootings along with Mr Monson, was shot dead while out shooting rabbits. The young gentleman was crossing dyke with his loaded gun, which he was carrying under his arm at full-cock. It is supposed that the trigger was caught bv the bushes, and this, it is believed, caused the gun accidentally to go off. The charge lodged in the unfortunate gentleman's head, and he was killed on the spot. His friends coming up immediately afterwards were too late to render any assistance. The body was removed to House, which is at present in the possession of the shooting tenants. The sad occurrence has cast a gloom over the district. Mr Hambro hod been staying at Ardlamout with his friend Mr Monson during the past three or four weeks.

The death of young Mr Hambrough, says the *N.B. Mail*, at Ardlament is singularly sad. He seemed to be one of " Fortune's children," with a life of happiness and ease before him. Had he lived till April next he would have attained his majority and inherited a fortune of about a quarter of a million, some £70,000 of which would probably have been devoted to the purchase of the Ardlamont estate, to which he had taken a strong liking since he became the shooting tenant a few months ago. Mr Hambro was a well-built, handsome young fellow, and his simple, frank, and courteous manners had already won him many friends in the district.

ARDLAMONT SHOOTING FATALITY. 

Investigation by the Fiscal. (*By Telegraph.*)  
DUNOON, 3.—Mr McNaughton, the deputy-Fiscal for Argyllshire, arrived in Dunoon this morning, after completing his investigation into the sad affair which occurred at Ardlamont on Thursday morning. The unfortunate young gentleman who met such an untimely end was only 20 years of age, and a lieutenant in the 3rd West Yorkshire Militia, his full name being Windsor Dudley Cecil Harmborough (*sic*). His father is Major Hamborough, of the same regiment. From the information now to hand, it appears that on the morning of the 10th August young Mr Hamborough went out about half-past six to shoot in a plantation close to Ardlamont House. He was accompanied by Alfred John Morrison (*sic*), his guardian, and Mr Edward Scott, engineer, Glasgow, the latter going out with the intention of carrying the game. Both Mr Hamborough and Mr Morrison had guns. In going through the plantation they separated, and in a few minutes time Mr Morrison heard a shot fired. He called out to Mr Hamborough, asking what he had_killed, but received no reply. Running in the direction from where the shot came, he was horrified to find the poor lad lying on his left side in a ditch with a gunshot wound immediately behind the left ear, the brains protruding. The gun was lying beside him. He was quite dead, No one saw the accident, and how it was caused will never be known. It is thought that he must have been walking along a dyke, which forms a sort of breast-wall, and slipped, the gun going off he fell.

The affair is one of the most lamentable that has ever happened in the district, and has cast a gloom over the whole place. The young gentleman's brother officers arrived at Ardlamont House later in the day for the purpose of enjoying a few days' shooting, and received a great shock on being informed that their friend was dead. Had Hamborough lived till he attained his majority he would have come in for a fortune of over a quarter of a million. He and Mr Morrison had just purchased the Ardlamont estate a week ago. The deceased lad's father and mother will arrive at Ardlamont today.

The death of "Mr Hambro" was also reported in the *Portsmouth Evening News*: "Mr Hambro" was, in fact, Lietentant Hambrough, scion of a notable family on the Isle of Wight:

THE COUNTY GENTLEMAN.

...

The sad accident by which Mr. Hamborough, of Ardlamont, in carrying his gun over a fence on his Argyllshire shooting, lost his life, has come as a reminder to some careless gunners that even in these days of patent intercepting safety blocks, automatic ejectors, and hammerless central fires, it is wise to cultivate a wholesome fear of the reckless use of firearms. Young gunners particularly are too apt to treat their central fires as if they were harmless walking-sticks. Natural carelessness prevents them appreciating risks to their friends or to themselves ; and though loading and unloading has now become so exceedingly easy it never occurs to them to beware of unloading in dangerous places, where a slip or a stumble may send them and their gun rolling over together, or in placing their weapons aside during lunch to be careful to extract the cartridges beforehand. Improvements have taken away seventy-five per cent. of the risk of accidents undertaken by our grandfathers, but the risk remaining, small as it is, should not be increased by the recklessness of headlong gunners, who forget, or have never learned, the danger of treating a central-fire as if it were a plaything. Gun accidents on the whole now are very infrequent, but it is only by a due exercise of sportmanlike carefulness that they can be kept from increasing in number.

A couple of weeks later, however, and rumours were starting to circulate:

THE ARDLAMONT SHOOTING FATALITY 

According to rumour pretty current in the Ardlament district, a new and startling development has taken place in regard the fatal shooting accident which occurred there nearly three weeks ago. It may be recalled that the story was that on the 10th of the present month Mr Hambro, the young gentleman, who had just attained his majority, was out shooting rabbits. It was said he was not proficient in handling a gun, and that while crossing a dyke his foot slipped, and the gun went off, all the contents lodging in his head. No one, however, seems to have been beside the unfortunate lad at the time, and it is now whispered that the gunshot wound did not appear to be such as an accident could account for. nor such as he could well have inflicted upon himself. The sheriff and a doctor and police officials visited the scene of the occurence on Saturday, and it is reported that the body of the deceased gentleman is to exhumed. It also appears that on the Tuesday prior to the accident young Hambro had a narrow escape from drowning. He was out boating, when the craft either sank or capsized. He was unable to swim, but was picked up by a gentleman who was fishing in the neighbourhood.

THE ARDLAMONT SHOOTING FATALITY.

Yesterday Captain Fraser, chief-constable for Argyllshire; Mr MacNaughton, deputy-fiscal for the county; and a police official from Gourock visited Ardlamont, Kyles of Bute, with the view of making further investigations regarding the sad death of Lieutenant Windsor Cecil Dudley Hamborough, of the West Yorkshire Militia, who was shot dead while out rabbit-shooting on the Ardlamont Estate on the morning of the 1Oth inst. The young gentleman's death, together with many strange rumours regarding it which are current in the Ardlamont district, has thrown the whole neighbourbood into a state of great excitement.

It will be remembered that on the morning of the 10th inst. Mr Hamborough. went out about half-past six to shoot in a plantation close to Ardlamont House. He was accomipanied by Mr Alfred John Monson, his guardian, and Mr Edward Scott, an engineer, the latter going out with the intention of carrying the game. Both Mr Hanmborough and Mr Monson had guns. In going through the plantation they separated, and in a few minutes' time Mr Monson heard a shot fired. He called out te Mr Hamborough, askise what he had killed, but received no reply, Running in the direction from where the shot came, he was horrified to find the poor lad lying on his left side in a ditch with a gunshot wound immediately behind the left ear, the brains protruding.

A new and startling development has taken place with regard to the tragic affair, inasmuch as Mr Scott has left. Inquiries are being made to ascertain his whereabouts, and it is hoped that, if found, he may be able to throw light on the mystery. It is said that Mr Hamborough was a novice with the gun, and that while going over a dyke his foot slipped and the gun went off. It is now rumnoured that the gunshot wound did not appear to be such as an accident of the kind could account for, nor such as he could have inflicted upon himself, the shot having entered the back of the left ear in a horizontal position. It is also rumoured that the company in which the deceased gentleman was insured had refused to pay the amount of the policy, but on inquiry we learn that up to the present time no claim has been lodged with the insurance company. The deceased gentleman had a narrow escape from drowning on the evening prior to his death.

Reports started to emerge about renewed official interest in the case:

THE ARDLAMONT SHOOTING CASE

Extraordinary Developments.  
Renewed Investigation the Police.  
(*From Our Special Reporter.*)  
TIGHNABRUAICH, Tuesday Morning.

Within the past few days the Ardlamont shooting case, briefly commented upon by the newspapers a fortnight ago as an unfortunate accident presenting no suspicious features, has been magnified in the eyes the people of Ardlamont, Dunoon, Tighnabruaich, and the neighbourhood into something approaching a tragedy. This new, and so far, unjustifiably extravagant view of the case has been the result of certain unusual steps on the part of the police authorities of the County of Argyll, in which the affair occurred. It is but right say at the outset that up till last night no evidence had been brought forward satisfactorily discrediting the hypothesis first formed that Mr Hamborough, the unfortunate victim of the accident of 10th inst., was killed by the accidental discharge of his own gun. The Argyllshire police authorities, however, would appear to consider that they have got upon the track of a serious crime, judging from the extraordinary and elaborate investigations and experiments they have been making in the course of the past week. At the present moment the entire criminal administration of the county massed on Ardlamont. The Sheriff-Substitute of the county, Mr Campbell Shairp, along with the Procurator-Fiscal, J. C. M'Lullich, and his deputy, Mr Thomas M'Naughton from Inveraray, as well as the Chief Constable of the county, Mr Fraser, from Lochgilphead, proceeded to Tighnabruaich yesterday afternoon in order to make the third investigation into all the details of the unfortunate incident. The whole district is accordingly in a state of intense excitement regarding the ultimate outcome of these police measures, and the wildest rumours are prevalent.

So briefly and so inaccurately was the affair of the 10th inst. reported that it may be well to give, even at this date,  
A CORRECT AND FULL ACCOUNT  
of it. At the outset is necessary to explain that the estate of Ardlamont is in the market for sale. It is an extensive and beautiful tract of country between Tighnabruaich and Lochfyne, and the passenger through the Kyles of Bute sees the southern extremity of it at the prominent portion of the northern mainland familiar as Ardlamont Point. The estate, according to the recent valuation, is worth about £82,000, and the upset price which it has been offered is £8O,OOO. A prospective purchaser of this old historic Cowal estate came forward last spring in the person of Mr Alfred John Monson, a Yorkshire gentleman, who now occupies the most unpleasant position of anyone involved in the shooting ease. He took the mansion house and shootings for the season as a temporary arrangement while the negotiations for the transfer of the estate were proceeding, and brought servants from England. A month or two later Mr Monson—who became very popular among the permanent officials and servants on the estate —was joined by a Mr Windsor Cecil Dudley Hamborough, a lieutenant in the 3rd Battalion West York Regiment (militia), whose "guardian" or trustee he was understood to be under the testament of a relative of Hamborough, who had left that gentleman a quarter of million of money. This money Mr Hamborough. who was 20 years of age, was to inherit on his majority. Mr Hamborough's arrival gave a new phase to the negotiations for the purchase of the estate, the understanding come to being that the purchase was to be a joint arrangement between Mr Monson and him. So far had the negotiations gone in this direction that it is probable, but for the affair of the 10th inst, the title-deeds would have been signed before now. A small steam launch, the "Alert," was purchased, and Mr Hamborough engaged  
A YOUNG MAN NAMED EDWARD SCOTT  
as engineer. Scott is described as a very gentlemanly-looking Englishman, who came to Ardlamont on the 9th, was nearly all the time in the company of his employers, and was even privileged to dine with them. Beyond this, nothing is known about him at Ardlamont, and his sudden and inexplicable disappearance from the place within the past week has been one of the incidents which have set the police upon a new course of investigation.

On the morning of Thursday, the 10th inst, Mr Monson and Mr Hamborough went out before breakfast to a small planting, near Ardlamont House, to shoot rabbits, and they were accompanied by Scott, who was to carry any game that might be killed. Scott had no gun. The guns which the two gentlemen carried were of different bores—one being a 12-bore and the other a 20. One rabbit only had been shot, and, to Monson's story, he was passing through the wood towards the house, on the opposite side of the wood from Mr Hamborough when he heard a shot fired. He cried out asking his fnend what he had got, and receiving no answer went in the direction in which he had heard the discharge, and found his friend lying dead beside a small embankment. The exact situation is within twenty yards of the high road, and beside the road are the stables of Ardlamont House, the house itself being only a few yards further off. Monson carried  
HIS OWN GUN AND HIS FRIEND'S  
into the house and got and a gardner and some others to remove the body there. The factor on the estate—Mr Steven—was called and Dr M'Millan, Tignabruaich, was sent for. The doctor, on examining the body, found a gunshot wound of between two and three inches wide behind the right ear. The wound, as would naturally happen in the case of a discharge of small shot at close range was pulpy and well-defined, and the face was untouched. Mortification ensued very rapdly, and whenever the deputy Procurator-Fiscal (Mr M'Naughton) had made the necessary formal examination of the body it was coffined and sent to the Isle of Ventnor (*sic*), Isle of Wight, for interment. Mr Steven, the factor, acting upon the instructions of the deceased's father and mother, who were summoned to Ardlamont on Thursday night, accompanied the coffin to the Isle of Wight.

The examination by the Deputy-Fiscal gave no substantial cause for doubting that an accident had happened in the manner suggested, although it was considered rather curious that a horizontal wound at the back of the right ear should have been caused by the accidental discharge of the victim's gun, the position necessary before such an occurrence could take place being a very improbable one. The explanation offered was that Mr Hamborough had been walking along the top of a dyke, carrying his gun at full cock, and had fallen off the dyke, with the result that the gun was discharged.

All these facts were collected by Mr M'Naughton, the Deputy-Fiscal, who proceeded to Inverary on Monday to lay them before his chief previous to their being reported in the ordinary course to Crown counsel. The bald facts of the case were secured with difficulty by the local correspondents of the Glasgow newspapers, and several details which were altogether erroneous. The whole matter was then considered to be at end. Local sentiment, and  
LOCAL IMAGINATION,  
the latter always very strong agent among country communities where tragedies are rare, began, however, to invest the affair with sinister theories, and certain new facts transpired which gave wings to all sorts of rumours. In the first place, it was learned that Mr Hamborough instead of being a novice with the gun, as was first stated, was an expert marksman, who had been for years used to the handling of firearms. Then it transpired that within a few days previously he had narrowly escaped death twice—once by the discharge of his gun and once by a boating accident. To crown all, the Procurator-Fiscal appeared on the scene again prepared to make further investigation, and was surprised to find that Scott had disappeared, leaving no trace behind. He left Tignabruaich by the Columba on Saturday, 12th, giving his address to the police as the Central Hotel, Glasgow. At the Central Hotel no such person is known, and Mr Monson, the only one who could be expected to give a clue to Scott's whereabouts, professes himself absolutely ignorant of his antecedents or his present location. The guns at this stage evidently assumed a new interest for the police, for they were taken possession of and sent to Inverary, mainly, it is understood, because of  
A GRAVE STATEMENT  
by a gamekeeper on the estate as to the relative users of the two guns and the apparent bore of weapon which had inflicted the wound. Experiments with the two guns at various ranges have, we understand, been made. The climax came, however, with the new fact which only canme to light last week, that the deceased's life was insured for £20,000 indirectly in favour of Mr Monson. Mr Monson, who was naturally very much affected by the lamentable occurrence of the 1Oth has within the past few days had the unpleasantness of his position intensified, for it understood that he is practically under police surveillance.

The rumours were by now being descibed as "sinister":

INSURED FOR £10,000.  
SINISTER RUMOURS.

According to rumour pretty current in the Ardlamont district of Argyleshire, a new and startling development has taken place in regard to the fatal shooting accident which occurred there nearly three weeks ago. It may be recalled (*says the Glasgow Evening Citizen*) that the story was that on the 10th of the present month Mr Hambro, the young gentleman, who had just attained his majority, was out shooting rabbits. It was said he was not proficient in handling gun, and that while crossing a dyke his foot slipped and the gun went off, all the contents lodging in his head. No one, however, seems to have been beside the unfortunate lad at the time, and it is now whispered that the gunshot wound did not appear to be such as an accident could account for nor such as he could well have inflicted upon himself. Deceased is reported to have been insured in an American office for £10,000, and in view of the mysterious nature of his death the insurance company, it is said, has declined to pay up. Be that as it may, the Sheriff and a doctor and police official visited the scene of the occurrence on Saturday and it is reported that the body of the deceased gentleman is to be exhumed. It also appears that on the Tuesday prior to the accident Hambro had a narrow escape from drowning. He was out boating with two friends when the craft either sank through the plug coming out or capsized. While his companions could swim, he was unable to do so, but was picked up by a gentleman who was fishing in the neighbourhood—only, however, as it turned out, to meet with a still more violent death two days later.

And then — an arrest, and an interview by the press with one of the estate workers:

THE ARDLAMONT SHOOTING CASE.  
Sensational Developments.  
ARREST OF MR MONSON  
His Removal to Inveraray-  
Rumoured Arrest of Scott  
(*From Our Own Reporter.*) 

TIGNABRUAICH, Wednesday.—The excitement regarding the Ardlamont shooting case reached a climax this forenoon, when Mr Monson, the tenant of the estate, was arrested. Sheriff Shairp and the representatives of the criminal authorities for the county took an extraordinary number of precognitions yesterday, and the substance of these justified them in taking that important and grave step.

The arrest was made in the morning, but it was done very quietly. The news, however, leaked out, and it was believed the prisoner would be at once taken to Inverary, a crowd gathered on the pier before eleven o'clock to await the arrival of the Lord of the Isles.

At a quarter-past eleven on the pier were the Sheriff, the Chief Constable, the Fiscal, and the Fiscal-Depute. They at once went on board. Behind them came a little group of three men, and they hurriedly went through the crowd and made their way downstairs. The three wore plain clothes —Constables Ross and M'Lean, with the prisoner, Mr Monson, young man, dressed in a stylish navy blue suit, black felt hat, and black bow tie, who shunned the eyes turned upon him, and looked exceedingly embarrassed and haggard.

The Columba happened this morning to get left behind by the Inverary steamer through calling at Kirn, and she arrived about five minuter behind the other. Mr Monson's brother and Steven, the factor, were on board. The brother was thunderstruck on being informed by the local constable of what had taken place, and the steamer conveying his brother whom he had specially come to meet being but few hundred yards off.

The village here remains in a state of surprise at the turn events have taken, more especially as it is rumoured that Scott has been taken into custody by the London police.

Interviews on the Estate.  
(*From Our Own Reporter.*)
TIGHNABRUAICH, Wednesday Morning.  
Following up the inquiry of yesterday, as fully reported in the *News*, I have interviewed a number of the persons upon whose evidence the action of the police authorities to a large degree depends ; and I have driven out to that portion of the estate where the incident of the 10th occurred. The police are naturally reticent, partly because they think it injudicious to confide too much in the reporters, but mainly because they have very little beyond incomplete theories to work upon. Scott's disappearance is, they admit, greatly to be regretted. All that was done to keep track of him was to instruct the policeman at Tighnabruaich Pier to get his name and address as left the Columba, and though this was done, it was, as events have proved, a useless precaution. The most graphic and reliable account of the whole affair which I have yet got was from Mr Steven, the acting factor on the Ardlamont estate. Mr Steven, who is a young man from Cathcart, is an acute and business like gentleman, popular with all the tenantry and employes on the estate. Residing within few hundred yards of Ardlamont House, he naturally came into daily contact with all the parties involved in this affair, and his services were particularly in request after the sad occurrence of the 10th. It is but fair to Mr Steven to say that had he been aware of the fact that his interviewer was a member of the press he would probably have been less free with his story, for the police have discouraged too much publicity in the meantime. "Mr Monson," he said, in answer to inquiries, "was the first one who, in response to advertisement in the papers, came here, and was followed sometime after by Hambrough. The statement that the estate was sold them made by some of the newspapers is untrue ;  
TERMS HAD NOT BEEN COME TO.  
Mr Monson is a quiet, good-natured gentleman, and so was Mr Hambrough. They were both temperate men, indeed Mr Hambrough was almost a teetotaler. So far as I saw all the party lived very harmoniously and agreeably together. The first time I saw Scott he was along with Mr Hambrough and Mr Monson, and I took him for one the party. On the morning of the 10th, when the three went out shooting they took a circuitous route round the estate coming back through the planting to the house in order to get breakfast. They were within twenty or thirty yards of being out of the wood when the shot was heard. Mr Hambrough was on the right side of the wood going toward the house, and Scott and Mr Monson were the opposite side of the wood. Hamurough's left side was towards his friends, and he was shot in the right side. I was not near the wood at the time, but am certain I heard the shot fired. Shortly afterwards the gardener came to me and told me one of the gentlemen had shot himself in the planting. We took a cart and found that Monson and Scott had lifted the body from the ditch it is believed to have fallen into, and placed him on the bank above it.  
I DID NOT SEE ANY GUNS  
Mr Monson was said to have carried them into the house. The body was carried into the house, and M'Millan was sent for. Mr Monson was, naturally, in a terribly grieved condition. I went to Glasgow to order a coffin and make arrangements for the removal of the body to Ventnor, and when on my way back I was joined by the father and mother of the deceased, who were very much shocked at the sudden death of their son. My impression is that Mr Hambrough met his death in the way suggested, falling while his gun was full cock, and consequently receiving the shot in his head. He was, I believe, an expert with the gun ; at least all the men about here say so, and his father told me that he had since early youth been accustomed to handle firearms. I am afraid the Procurator Fiscal has been too hastily flying at  
RASH CONCLUSIONS  
in this matter. I speak from an intimate knowledge of all the facts and of all the parties. One thing, by the way, which seems to have passed unobserved that some of the scattered pellets from the fatal shot lodged in a tree beside which Mr Hambrough fell. The marks are plainly to be distinguished.

Where does Mr Monson come from?

I don't know ; I have heard that he comes from Yorkshire, but can't speak with any certainty. The arrangements for letting the place were made through our Edinburgh agents.

And Mr Hambrough. where does he come from?

He belonged to Yorkshire, but his family, so far as I can learn, is best known at Ventnor.

What about the insurance on the life of the deceased, said have been assigned to Mr Monson ?

Well, I have spoken to Mr Monson about that, and he has told me, and can prove, that the death of his friend means a considerable loss of money to him. I consider all the prevalent rumours as absurd."

One of the men the estate, speaking evidently the sentiments of his fellow workmen, expressed the utmost sympathy with Mr Monson in his troubles. At the same time he animadverted strongly upon the conduct of the shooting party (augmented since the accident) which has not lost a single day's sport on the hill since the sad event. I was anxious to see Monson and have an interview with him. but was informed that he was that moment away shooting. A somewhat  
FORMAL DINNER PARTY  
it is said, took place in the house on the evening on which the Depute-Procurator-Fiscal made his examination. It is hardly necessary to say that that gentleman did not avail himself of an invitation he got to be present. His examination was carried out under the most unpleasant conditions, for the usual dressings above the wound had slipped off, and besides the purely legal duties of Procurator-Fiscal. Mr M'Naugbton had to exercise those of another profession by putting lint dressings on the body himself. It is significant of the distressing effect the accident had upon both Mr Monson and Mr Scott that none of them could be prevailed upon to look at the body after it had been carried into the house.

Since Monday the estate officials have prevented any unauthorised person visiting that portion the estate in which the accident occurred, but for the time being I found the rule relaxed, and drove from Tighnabruaich to the edge of the wood where Mr Hambrough was shot. It is round a corner from the factor's house, and within sight of the mansion-house — the stables, indeed, as stated yesterday, being only a few yards from where Mr Hambrough's body was found. The wood is mere planting.” much longer than it is broad, and, as there little brush in it, and the trees are fairly wide apart, one can see right through it. Mr Hambrough's body when seen by the factor and workmen was on the extreme edge of the wood, beside a moss-covered or drystone dyke, or rather embankment, which dips a few feet into an adjoining field. Scott said they found Mr Hambrough in the field, and lifted him up on to the bank. As is the custom among Highlanders, the workmen on the estate have already piled a smail cairn of stones at the spot.

SCOTT'S DISAPPEARANCE  
was in no way covert, it should be understood. He told several people that as he would not be needed any longer for the "Alert" he would go. He was, according to his first plan, to go away at two o'clock in the afternoon, but as some further information was wanted from him, he remained for the Columba at 2.45. Mr Steven, the factor, drove him in his gig to Tighnabruaich Pier.

By this point, details of Mr Monson were becoming of interest:

THE ARDLAMONT MYSTERY.

Mr. Alfred Monson was brought before the Sheriff at Court House to-day. The proceedings were private, but it is understood that Mr. Monson sticks circumstantially to the account already given by him of what he knew of the tragic death of Mr. Hambrough on the 10th inst. Mr Monson is the third son of the late Rev. Monson, Rector of Kirkby-under-Dale, Yorkshire, his mother being a daughter of the fifth Viscount Galway.

Details were also emerging about another near-fatal accident suffered by Mr Hamborough just hours before his death:

THE ARDLAMONT MYSTERY.  
DECLARATION BY THE PRISONER.

Mr Monson made a declaration to-day before Sheriff Shairp at Inveraray. The examination was of course conducted in private; but, it is understood, that Mr Monson sticks substantially by his former account of the affair of the 10th inst.

MR HAMBROGH AND MR MONSON.

As erroneous statements have been put in currency as to the connection of the two principal parties in this lamentable tragedy, the following particulars, taken from an authoritative source, says the *N. B. Mail*, may be given :—

Windsor Dudley Cecil Hambrough was the eldest son of Dudley Albert Hambrough Esq., Steephill Castle, Isle of Wight He was born 1873, and would have attained his majority early next year. He was lieutenant in the 4th Battalion Prince of Wales' Own Yorkshire Regiment. Lieutenant Hambrough's father is a J.P. for Hants, and the patron of two livings, and resides principally at Houghton, Stookbridge.

Alfred John Monson is the third son of the late Rev. Thomas John Monson, rector of Kirby-under-Dale, Yorkshire, his mother being a daughter the fifth Viscount Galway. He was born in May, 1860, and is thus in his 34th year. Mr Monson is a member of the family which Viscount Oxenbridge, the Master of the Horse, is the head, his grandfather, the Hon. and Rev. Thomas Monson. rector of Bedale, having been a son of the second Baron Monson, and the granduncle of the present Peer.

ANOTHER INSURANCE PROPOSAL.

A Rothesay correspondent telegraphs:—It may be stated that Dr Lawson. Rothesay, received a communication on 25th July from the head office of the Royal Insurance Company, Liverpool, stating that Lieutenant Windsor Dudley Cecil Hambrough, who, it was said, was then residing in Rothesay, would call for medical examination with reference to insurance. The young gentleman, however, did not call. He was said to be 21 years of age and resided at Risely Hall, Ripley, Yorkshire.

NOTES AND INCIDENTS.

The case, to which the arrest has imparted a complexion which it did not seem to bear at first, seems, says the *Glasgow Herald*, more peculiar the more it is inquired into. For obvious reasons it would be injudicious at the present time publish all the circumstances connected with it. There has been a good deal of comment on the fact that Mr Hambrough was rescued from a perilous position not many hours before he lost his life by shooting. At dusk on the evening of the 9th instant he went out sea-fishing in a boat with Mr Monson at Ardlamont Point. The boat struck on a rock and filled with water. Hambrough could not swim, but his companion could do so, and he went ashore for aid, returning with another boat in which he took his ward to land. Both men arrived at Ardlamont House at two o'clock in the morning, drenched to the skin, and Hambrough in particular very much exhausted. In spite of this they were early astir, and were out shooting as early as six o'clock. As an explanation of the reason why they were so soon about, Mr Monson that his wife and family, who were residing with him at Ardlamont, had occasion to visit Glasgow that day, and that as he had to be up at any rate to see them off he thought might as well put in the morning rabbit shooting with his ward. An hour and half after they set out Mr Hambrough was lying dead, shot in the back of the head. The gardener and the joiner who are employed on the estate were summoned, and they carried the body into the mansion-house, where it was seen two hours afterwards by Dr Macmillan, from Tighnabruaich. He wrote a report on the case, stating that death had resulted from a gunshot wound, and gave it as his opinion that it might have been caused by Mr Hambrough getting over the wall where his body was found holding his gun incautiously in his hand. This report, it may be explained, was granted on the assumption that the young gentleman had been using a short 20-bore sporting gun. It was subsequently ascertained, however, that his gun was a long 12-bore. In reference to this, Mr Monson said that they had exchanged guns when they were out. They had really wished to test a new sporting powder, known as amberite, and finding that they had no cartridges that morning which would suit Hambrough's gun they effected the exchange. In view of the fact referred to, Dr Macmillan at once withdrew his report and certificate from the Procurator-Fiscal, and also from the officials of American Insurance Company who had insured Mr Hambrough's life before his death for £20,000. At the time of the tragedy young Hambrough was in his twenty-first year, and it is believed there was an uncompleted document in existence which had been written with the object assigning the policy to Mr Monson.

A SINISTER FACT.

In the hurry and bustle incidental to so sad a tragedy it is not strange that some minor matters should have escaped attention at the time. About six yards distant from the place where Hambrough's feet were there is a small tree growing, and a careful examination of the bark about the height of a man's head shows a number pellet marks. The young man's head was not disfigured by the scorching or burning of gunpowder. 

```

As word came out that the original examining doctor's report had been withdrawn, it was revelaed that Hambrough's body was to be exhumed. Scott's disappearance was also increasingly commented upon, and his description started to be circulated, even as there were rumpours of his arrest in London.

THE ARDLAMONT MYSTERY.  
ARREST OF MONSON.  
HIS WARD'S BODY TO BE EXHUMED.  
THE MISSING MAN SCOTT.  
RUMOURED ARREST IN LONDON.  
EXCITEMENT IN THE DISTRICT.

Yesterday morning Mr Alfred Henry Monson, the tenant of the Ardlamont estate, Argyllshire, was arrested in connection with the death of his ward, Windsor Dudley Cecil Hambrough, by shooting, on the 10th of this month, full particulars of which were given in yesterday's *Courier*. The arrest was effected very quietly at seven o'clock in the moi on the public road leading to Ardlamont House >y Chief Constable Eraser. When about five miles out from Tighnabruaich, and within two miles Ardlamont House, met driving in a pony trap with guest who was going awav the Glasgow and South-Western steamer Neptune for Prince's Pier, Greenock. Seated at the back of Mr Monson's machine was a police officer, Sergeant Ross, of Lochgilpheau, who been shadowing him since Monday night. When Captain Fraser met the party he intimated that he had some business with throwing the reins to his friend, told him to on and leave the horse and machine the village. Mr Monson, apparently thinking that the liiei Constable was going straight the house, off his own trap and jumped on Captain Fraser's trap, and was followed by Sergeant Ross. Having got his man safely on board, Captain Fraser then turned the horse's head towards Tighnabruaich, and was told that he might consider himself his prisoner for having caused the death his friend, Hambrough. Monson, although taken by surprise by the suddenness of his arrest, took the matter very coolly. The prisoner was conveyed the Royal Hotel at Tighnabruiach, the party being met by the road Sheriff and the Fiscals, who were going out to the scene of the fatality to make some further inquiries bofore leaving the neighbourhood. The prisoner was removed to Inveraray by the Lord of the Isles. Monson is yonngish-looking man. His age is 35. He is middle height and fair complexion, and has a cleanshaven face, sharp features, and a rather prominent nose, which is slightly twisted to one side. At Crarae Mr M'Laclilan, writer, Lochgilphead, joined the Lord of the Isles, and proceeded with the prisoner to Inveraray. Mr M'Lachlan is act the prisoner's defence. telegraphed him before leaving Tighnabruaich.

BODY TO EXHUMED.

In view of the developments in the case, the body of Hambrough, which was taken England for interment, is to be exhumed.

COULD THE INSURANCE POLICY BE ASSIGNED ?

As has been already stated, the deceased gentleman about ten days before his death effected insurance for £20,000 with the Mutual Life Assurance Society of New York. The policy, however, having to come from New York, had never reached him, and could not, therefoie, have beon assigned to any one, whatever the intention may have been. Regarding the alleged assignation of the insurance policy on Hambrough's life to Monson, our representative was yesterday told that Monson's own explanation of the matter that the police was in course of being assigned to him, but that the assignment was not the date of Hambrough's death.

THE NATURE OF THE EVIDENCE.

The evidence in possession of the authorities believed, so far, to be circumstantial. Special points which are being investigated are the probable elevation at which the gun went off, and the kind of shot with which was loaded. It is reported that some of the pellets lodged in the trunk of a tree near at hand about a man s height.

THE MISSING MAN SCOTT.

Edward Scott, the man who is wanted by the police, is 28 years of age, between 5 ft. 9 in. and 5 ft. 10 in. in height. He has a sallow complexion, small dark moustachios, steel grey eyes, and carries his head erect, but there is nothing peculiar ia his gait. At the time he was last seen he wore a dark blue cloth coat and waistcoat and dark grey trousers. It is understood that Monson has given information to the police to the effect that he has heard from Scott since lie left Tighnabruaich, and that he believes that he is at present in London. When Scott was leaving Tighnabruich on the evening of the Saturday when young Hambrough was shot the local policeman, Duncan M'Calman, in view of the fact that the inquiry had not been completed, with commendable official sagacity, advised him not to go away, but as he had not a warrant he could not, of course, detain him, and Scott accordingly went on board the boat.

THE BOATING ACCIDENT.

There has been lot of talk here during the past day or two about the boating and the shooting accident occurring on the some morning within such short time of each other, the accident on the loch happening half-past one, and the fatal shooting affair at half-past seven. The explanation given of that is that Mrs Monson and her family, three in number, required to go Glasgow by the early morning boat, and that the family had all to be up very early in consequence. He also got Hambrough up, and, when his wife and family had gone, the three men (Scott, it will be recollected, being with them) went out shooting. When the body was found the men got the gardener and joiner on the estate, and they, with young Lyon, the farmer's son, removed the remains into the mansion house.

THE DOCTOR'S STATEMENT.

Dr M'Millan, of Tighnabruaich, who examined Hambrough's body, granted a report in which he certified that death had resulted from gunshot wound, and it is further said that he led it be understood that he was perfectly satisfied that the death had been an accidental one. On that account the inquiry was the meantime stayed, only to be resumed on Thursday last more extended scale in consequence of rumoursi having got abroad that there had been foul play the matter. Monson's arrest is believed to have been made under instructions from the Crown Counsel. It is now stated that Dr M'Millan withdrew his first report and certified that the accident had not occurred in the way he had at first supposed.

MONSON BEFORE THE SHERIFF.

Monson was brought before Sheriff-Substitute yesterday afternoon for emitting declaration. On the motion, however, of his agent, Mr M'Lachlan, the examination was adjourned till this forenoon eleven o'clock, to admit the prisoner's Edinburgh agent, Mr Davidson Syme, Castle Street, being present.

ARREST OF SCOTT.

Mr Monson's brother, and Steven, the factor, arrived at Tignabruaich just after the Lord of the Isles had sailed for Inveraray with Mr Monson, a prisoner, on board. The brother was thunderstruck on being informed by the local constable of what had taken place, and the steamer conveying his brother, whom had specially come to meet, being but a few hundred yards off. The excitement in Tignabruaich was intensified yesterday by a rumour that Scott had been taken into custody the London police. 

```

Although now under arrest, it seems as if Monson was still enjoying the comforts of life, even as questions were being asked about the state of the insurance policies and the extent to which he may or may not have benefitted from them:

The Ardlamont Mystery

MONSON BEFORE THE SHERIFF

THE INSURANCE QUESTION.

SCOTT STILL AT LARGE.

Mr Alfred Monson was yesterday brought before Sheriff Shairp in the Courthouse, Inveraray, and judicially examined on the charge of causing the death of Mr Windsor Dudley Cecil Hamhrough, by shooting, at Ardlamont, on the 10th of the present month. After emitting his declaration, the accused was committed to prison for further examination. It is probable that he will brought up for his second examination after a lapse of eight days, and if he is then committed to prison he will be removed to Greenock, there to await his trial.

Accused in Prison.

Mr Monson is meantime living comfortably, if not luxuriously, at his own expense. His meals are brought into him from the George Hotel, which adjoins the Courthouse. On Wednesday he had a dinner of three courses. He had tea in the evening, and breakfast was carried to him before nine o'clock yesterday morning. In other respects he is being treated as an ordinary prisoner. He sleeps in his clothes on the raised wooden bed-shaped arrangement on the floor of the cell, with a couple of blankets thrown over him. He is said to be now feeling his position, it is believed, very keenly. While under police surveillance from Monday night till Wednesday morning his behaviour savoured something of bravado. On Tuesday he was out shooting on the moor in the company of some of his guests with a policeman walking on each side of him, and he drove about, dined, and slept constantly shadowed by representatives of the law, and never once did he show the least sign of annoyance or discomposure.

APPLICATION TO HOME SECRETARY.

The criminal authorities are preparing precognitions to be laid before Crown counsel. An application has been made to the Home Secretary for authority to exhume the remains of the young gentleman who is alleged have been murdered. Mr Hambrough's body was buried in the Isle of Wight in the family burial-ground there, and an official from Inveraray will go through to the Isle Wight to superintend the exhuming and examination the remains. From hints which have been dropped since Monson's arrest, it is believed that, if the case goes to trial at all, the evidence will be of a rather sensational nature. It is now stated that Monson was not Hambrough's legal guaidiau all, but only his tutor.

WARRANT TOR ARREST.

A warrant for the arrest the missing engineer, Edward Scott, was signed Wednesday night.

THE ACCUSED.

Alfred John Monson is the third son of the late Rev. Thomas John Monson, rector of Kirby-under-Dale. Yorkshire, his mother being the daughter of the fifth Viscount Galway. He was born in May, 1858, and is thus in his thirty-fourth year. Mr Monson is a member of the family of which Viscount Oxenbridge, the Master of the Horse, is the head, his grandfather, the Hon. and Rev. Thomas Monson, rector of Bedale, having been a son of the second Baron Monson, and the grand-uncle of the present peer.

THE DECEASED

Windsor Dudley Cecil Hambrough was thee eldest son of Dudley Albert Hambroug, Esq., of Steephill Castle, Isle of Wight. He was bron in 1873, and would have attained his majority early next year. He was a Lieutenant in the 4th Battalion Prince of Wales' Own Yorkshire Regiment. Lieutenant Hambrough's father is a J.P. for Hants and the patron of two livings, and resides principally at Houghton, Stockbridge.

THE TRUE STORY OF THE INSURANCE

From a thoroughly reliable source the Glasgow *Evening Citizen* has learned all about the insurance negotiations, concerning which no end of rumours have been in circulation. Mr Hambrough being desirous of insuring his life approached the Mutual Life Assurance Society, of New York, through their Glasgow office, and, after the usual preliminaries of examination and references, a policy or policies amounting to £20,000 were taken out. When the insurance was being effected it was understood by the representatives of the Company that the policy was to be assigned to Mr Monson, with whom, indeed, there were one or more interviews on the subject. The question naturally arises, why should Mr Hambrough ASSIGN THE POLICY TO HIS FRIEND Mr Monson? The explanation seems a reasonable one. Mr Hambrough was desirous of purchasing the Ardlamont estate, and required money for this purpose. Although having the prospect of great wealth when he came of age, Mr Hambrough was not, in the meantime, in the possession of much money, and, as it was, was indebted to his friend Monson. The latter gentleman himself is reported not to be rich, but his wife is stated to be wealthy. Indeed, it is said that the intention first was to assign the policy to this lady and her children as the advances for the acquiring of the estate to be made out of her money. As events turned out,
THE POLICY NEVER WAS ASSIGNED.

And for the best of all reasons — it had not been received from the head office in New York, and, of course, no transfer could take place without the principal document. Mr Hambrough had merely received a receipt or covering note pending the arrival of the policy. This, then, leads directly the conclusion that Mr Monson can derive no pecuniary benefit from the death of Mr Hambrough. Whatever may have been the intentions of the contracting parties, there has been no assignation whatever of the policy, and whoever the Mutual Life Aseurance Society of New York pay the £20,000 to it will certainly not be Mr Monson, but the relatives of the deceased gentleman.

```

Once the order for the exhumation was approved by the Home Secretary, little time was wasted in carrying it out. And as the news story developed, we can only imagine how gripped people were to hear the next installment, and the extent to which they were forming their own opinions about whether the death was an accident, or something more sinister, with the tragic incident that alerted me to this story in the first place, in what is now *The Ferryman* pub in Lymington:

THE SCOTCH SHOOTING CASE

EXHUMATION OF LIEUT. HAMBROUGH'S BODY.  

OPINION AS TO THE WOUNDS.

HIS INSURANCE POLICIES.

A Ventnor correspondent, telegraphing last night, says: —The body if Lietenant Windsor Cecil Dudley was exhumed this afternoon Ventnor, in the presence of an immense crowd of spectators. Early in the day communication had been received by the Rev. J. Hall Smith, Vicar of St. Catherine's, the Mother Church, from the Lord Advocate, to the effect that the application to tha Home Secretary for order to exhume the body had been successful, and that the gentlemen having the matter in hand behalf the Government would arrive at Ventnor at three o'clock in the afternoon with full power to remove the body. The deceased, like his father, was well known at Ventnor, and when Major arrived the London train shortly before four o'clock, met with many expressions of sympathy. It is stated that he was at the Home Office on Sunday from eleven till seven o'clock with his legal advisers. In an interview this afternoon Major Hambrough, while remarking that he was unable to make any statement at the present time, being in a sense in the hands of the police, said that it was fact that two policies had been effected on his son's life  
EACH FOR TEN THOUSAND POUNDS  
and that a few daya before the death of his son they were both assigned to Mrs. Monson, not to the prisoner. There came over by the train already mentioned Mr. J. C. MacCulloch, of Inverary, Procurator Fiscal. Mr. MacNaughten, Deputy-Procurator Fiscal of Argyleshire, also arrived, accompanied by Dr. Littlejohn, of Edinburgh, and Dr. McMillan, who first examined the deceased. Dr. Sanders, of Edinburgh, came the same train to be present at the examination on behalf of the prisoner Monson. They drove to the Royal Marine Hotel. A messenger was immediately sent for the vicar, who proceeded to the hotel and signed the order of the Secretary of State placing the churchyard at the disposal of the Procurator Fiscal and his party. The opening of the grave was immediately proceeded with in the presence of Mr. MacNaughten and the Deputy Chief Constable Gibson, who, with a staff of police, kept the public outside the graveyard. It was intended to examine the body in the mortuary, but this was found to be too confined for such an operation, and it was taken out again and placed upon a bier in the cemetery yard. Removed from the case in which it was enclosed within the oak coffin, it was examined in the open and identified.

Immediately the lead inside coffin was opened the body was identified by one or two who knew Lieutenant Hambrough quite well. The body was greatly decomposed. The examination lasted over two hours, and was not completed before darkness set in. Photographs of wounds in the head of the deceased were taken in several aspects. Photograpbs were also obtained of internal sections of the scull. Major Hambrough was present at the cemetery, and watched the proceedings from a distance.  
HE WAS DEEPLY AGITATED.  
After the examination the body was again placed in the coffins, which were sealed and screwed down. The re-interment, which took place about ten o'clock, was unaccompanied by any ceremony. The legal and medical officials conducting the investigation were extremely reticent as to the result of the post-mortem, but sufficient was permitted to leak out to favour the conviction that the wound was not self-inflicted. Several pellets were found in the head, and it was demonstrated that the shots entered the head from the back and passed out behind the ear, a portion of which was carried away. All the medical gentlemen were, it is understood, perfectly satisfied that there was singeing of the hair or skin around the wound, which leads to the belief that the instrument of death could not have been in the hands of the unfortunate young gentleman. The body was formally identified on the coffins being opened by Dr. McMillan and Mr. MacNaughten. Major Hambrough was not asked to perform this painful duty. The gentleman who accompanied Mr. Monson on the occasion of the funeral waa not the the missing Mr. Scott, but Mr. Stevens, the factor of the Ardlamont Estate.

The Hambrough family trace their descent back to 1670.  Steephill Castle is erected on the sight of a rustic thatched villa, built about 1700 by the Right Hon. Hans Stanley, when Governor of the island, and a later period inhabited by an Earl of Dysart. The structure was commenced by J. Hambrough in 1833, and completed in two years. It was designed by Sanderson, the architext of the Ryde Town-hall. The mansion, situated about half a mile from Ventnor, is an imitation of the baronial castles of the reign of Stephen. In the grounds, some seventy or eighty acres in extent, there is an historic well dedicated to St. Lawrence, and a short distance further on the village of St. Lawrence, the parish of which consists of a strip of land extending about a mile and a half along the seashore. A few years ago the estate was in the books of a Piccadilly agent, the upset price being £30,000.

The question arises  
WHETHER ANYONE WITNESSED THE FATALITY.  
The prisoner states that he and Scott were amongst the trees of larger growth, out of sight, the one carrying the 20-bore gun and the other a few rabbits. They heard a shot fired, and rushing forward to see what success had attended the shot, they found Mr. Hambrough lying dead. But a third person heard the shot, a gentleman who occupied the neighbouring schoolhouse for the month. The next thing he heard was that a fatality had occurred. He has been interviewed by the authorities, since which he has gone home, and the house again tenanted by the schoolmistress. Mr. Monson regards this stranger a witness in his favour, and his address is retained. With regard to Mr. Scott, Mr. Monson only knew him for a few hours. The prisoner asserts this himself.

THE TREND OF THE EVIDENCE.  
WHAT THE PHOTOGRAPHS WILL PROVE.

The Press Association's Ventnor correspondent, telegraphing this morning, states that Professor Littlejohn's testimony regarding the death of Lieut. Hambrough will be altogether opposed to the theory that he lost his life through an accident. In addition to the absence of singeing of the hair, it is regarded as a significant fact that no wadding from the cartridge was found in the head, photographs of which have been taken in six different positions. The party which attended the exhumation left Ventnor this morning for Glasgow, and will proceed thence to Inverary, to attend the hearing of the charge against Monson, which will be resumed on Friday next. 

EXPLAINING THE ARDLAMONT MYSTERY.

TRAGIC SHOOTTNG ACCIDENT.

The Press Association's Lymington correspondent telegraphs.— A tragically shocking affair occurred this morning at Wallhampton. Henry Card, a gamekeeper in the employ of Mr. J. W. Heseltine was talking with the landlord of the local public house, when the conversation turned upon the Ardlamont shooting mystery. Card insisted that it was possible that Mr. Hamborough's injuries were self-inflicted, and in order to demonstrate this he took up his gun, placed it behind his back with one hand, and reaching down the other hand, pulled the trigger. The gun happened to be loaded, and Card blew the top of his skull off. He is not dead yet, but the doctors state that it will be impossible for him to recover.

TRAGIC AFFAIR AT LYMINGTON.

Our Lymington correspondent writes:— A shocking affair occurred at the Wagon and Horses Inn, Walhampton, on Tuesday. A man named Henry Card, employed as gamekeeper at Walhampton Park, entered the taproom and ordered pint of beer. He was served, and whilst drinking it a conversation took place amongst the company present as to the probability of Lieut. Hambrough's gunshot wound in the neck having been self-inflicted. A man said be was sure it was not, a statement Card contradicted, adding that he could easily demonstrate how it could be done. Handing his double-barrelled gun to one of the company, he said, "You try; it's empty." The man declined, and Card then took the gun, placed it behind his back, and tried in two or three different ways to get the muzzle against his neck. To the astonishment of all present, the gun suddenly exploded, the charge blowing off the top of Card's head, leaving the brain protruding. Drs. Rendall and Hill were speedily in attendance, but there was no hope from the first, and Card died within two hours. He was 38 years of age, and leavea wife and nine children unprovided for. The tragic affair caused quite a consternation in the town.

The inquest was held on Thursday afternoon the Wagon and Horses Inn, Walhampton, before Mr. Bernard Harfield, county coroner. The evidence was to the following effect:— Dr. Rendall deposed that was called in immediately after the accident and found the deceased lying insensible on the floor of the inn, his face downwards, surrounded by pools of blood and scattered brains. On examining the head be found an irregular lacerated wound, about two inches in diameter, situated on the upper part of the back of the head, rather inclined to the right side. From this brain matter was exuding and hemorrrhage occurring. He did all he could, but Card eventually became comatosed and died two hours after receiving the injury. The wound was a gunshot wound. The man's condition was hopeless from the first. —James Geary, living near, deposed to seeing the deceased just before he entered the public-house. Card had then opened his gun, apparently for the purpose of drawing the cartridges, but just at that time their attention was attracted to a crowd of persons crossing the railway bridge, and witness could not say whether deceased actually did remove the cartridges.— John Bligh, friend of the landlord of the Wagon and Horses, deposed to Card coming in and having pint of beer. A discussion took place relative to the Scotch shooting case, when deceased denied that it was impossible for Lieut. Hambrough's wound have been self-inflicted. He asked Bligh to take up his gun and try, saying it was empty. Bligh not caring to do so, Card seized the gun, cocked the hammer, and after some difficulty in getting it in position behind his back, pulled trigger and exploded one barrel with fatal effect.— Other evidence was given, all showing that Card had been fully under the belief that his gun was empty.— A verdict of "Accidental death" was returned.

SHOCKING GUN ACCIDENT NEAR LYMINGTON. INQUEST AT WALHAMPTON.

The County Coroner (Mr. B. Harfield) held an inquest on Thursday afternoon, at the Waggon and Horses, Walhampton, in connection with a tragic calamity that took place there at mid-day Tuesday, when Henry Card, aged 31, of Snook's Farm, a gamekeeper in the employ of Mr. J. P. Heseltine, shot himself whilst attempting to show how Lieut. Hantheough might have done so. On assembling the jury inspected the low-roofed tap-room in which the tragedy occurred, the ceiling of which showed a cluster of shot-marks, and some hair where the charge had scattered after striking the deceased. From the inn they proceeded to deceased's home, a secluded country homestead, about a mile off, to view the body. The inquest commenced sitting at quarter-past four, first witness called being Dr. Rendell, who deposed that he was on that side of the water about ten minutes to twelve, and was asked to go to the Waggon and Horses. On his arrival he entered the tap-room, and found the deceased lying INSENSIBLE ON THE FLOOR, lying on his left side with his face downwards. and surrounded by pools of blood and scattered brains. An examination of his head showed an irregular lacerated wound about two inches in diameter, situated at the upper part of the back of the head, rather inclined to the right side, from which brain matter was exuding and hemorrhage occurring. He did all he could for him by endeavouring to atop the haemorrhage by pressure, but he gradually became more insensible and eventually comatosed, and died about two hours afterwards ; he had no other marks of injury observable. In his opinion the wound was a gunshot one. He considered the case hopeless from the first.

James Geary, of Waterman's Farm, stated that at about 11 o'clock on Tuesday morning, whilst he was working in the field the deceased spoke to him. They had a little conversation about his birds, when the deceased looked to the railway line and said " What a lot people going down the line; I wonder what's up." At the same time he unlocked his gun, a breechloader, apparently, as I thought, to take the cartridges out, but, drawing my attention to the people going down the line, I did not take notice whether he took the cartridges out or not. A few minutes afterwards, deceased left him and went across the field in the direction the Lymington ferry. He noticed nothing unusual in his manner.

John Bligh, of London, staying at the Waggon and Horses, was told at about half past eleven that Mr. Card was in the house and he wanted a pint of beer, with which he supplied him ; another customer had a pint of beer, and after drawing that and a pint for himself he went into the tap-room and asked Mr. Card to drink. He said to deceased " I see they have had rather a scene across in the Island, or at Ventnor." He said " Is that that gentleman that was shot in Scotland?" Witness fetched the paper, and read the article to him, some gentleman sitting in the room said that the old keeper in Scotland said it was impossible for Lieut. Hambrough to have shot himself as he was shot, Card replied "OH YES HE COULD DO SO."

He invited witness to try, saying "There is my gun, you can try it, it is empty." Witness was sitting on a seat, and didn't offer to get up. Card was nursing a little white dog at the time ; he instantly put the dog down, and took the gun up and cocked it. He then took it in his right hand, put it behind his back, with the muzzle towards the back of his head, and then fired. Witness iilustrated his explanation with the aid of the gun in question. He
SAW DECEASED PRESS THE TRIGGER,
and when the deed was done he put the gun down on to the table, and gradually sank down. The other hammer was at full cock. Witness called Mr. Gosling, the landlord, and asked where he could get a doctor, and was told across in the town, he called out to the ferryman to get his boat ready as quick as he could. He went into the town and summoned a doctor. When witness returned a doctor had arrived. Witness considered the shooting the result of an accident. Deceased seemed in his usual spirits. When deceased came into the tap-room, on putting down his gun, he stated to a boy that it was not loaded. Fitz Inman, of Wolverhamptan, knew the deceased well, and identified him after death. On Tuesday morning between half-past eleven and twelve witness was at the Waggon and Horses when Mr. Card came in. He was not in the tap-room at the time of the occurrence, being then on his way home to get a paper. He heard the report of a gun when he reached his door, and it appeared to come from the inn. He was called back to the house by the landlord. On opening the tap-room door he found deceased with his head resting on the settle. Witness took hold of him and eased him on to the floor. Witness took the pipe deceased was smoking out of his mouth. When witness left the room the gun was lying on the settle, he did not notice where it was on his return. He did not hear deceased say the gun was not loaded ; deceased was A VERY CAREFUL MAN with guns. The gun used was not deceased's but had been used by him for some weeks. The only other man the room when witness left was Mr. Bligh, though he believed a man named Etheridge entered the room just after he felt. It was not considered necessary to call Etheridge, as he could not add materially to Mr. Bligh's statement. The Coroner summed up briefly, and the jury returned a verdict of ACCIDENTAL DEATH. The deceased leaves a wife and nine young children.

THE ARDLAMONT MYSTERY

EXCITEMENT AT VENTNOR, EXHUMATION OF LIEUTENANT HAMBROUGH'S REMAINS.

MR. MONSON COMMITTED FOR TRIAL

HEAVY INSURANCE POLICIES.

Public interest has during this week been keenly aroused in what has become widely known as the Ardlamont mystery, and when it was ascertained that an application had been made to the Home Secretary for permission to exhume the body of Lieut. Hamborough, the keenest excitement was exhibitied throughout the Island. Events have followed each other rapidly, and having despatched a special representative to Ventnor, we are able to give the fullest details of the proceedings.

INTERVIEW WITH THE VICAR.

In the course of an interview the Vicar (the Rev. Mr. Shaw) told our reporter that he was much upset about the affair. It was the first of the kind he had ever been mixed up in. The certificate of death was brought to him by Mr. Monson and Mr Houston, the clerk of Ventnor Local Board, and who was for a long time agent to the estate. He saw them in his study, and they handed in a certificate signed by "Alexander Stewart, of Kilpinan," but it did not state any cause of death, that not being required. The Vicar enquired as to the accident and Mr. Monson, who appeared deeply affected, answered. He was, said the Vicar, a very good looking young gentleman, but at the time he was not aware of his identity: but gathered from his remarks that he was the undertaker. Indeed he was very much impressed with the fact, because at the funeral Mr Monson was moved to tears, which led the Vicar to mentally remark "This is the first time I have seen an undertaker cry." The explanation given to him of the accident was that the deceased stepped on some furze which concealed a hidden drain, and this led the Vicar to preach the funeral sermon on the Sundary evening following, from the words "There is but a step between me and death "; that in the morninng being "Jesus wept." Every effort was made by Mr. Manson to get the body interred in the family vault, but there is a strong feeling in Ventnor against disturbing the bodies in vaults beneath the church; therefore the Vicar declined to act unless under an order from the Home Office, which did not arrive in time.

![](hambrough-hampshire-independent-9-9-93.png)

During the week there have been numbers of visitors at the churchyard to view the grave of the deceased. It is almost opposite the front of the beautiful church his grandfather erected, and is covered with beautiful flower and plants. The stone is a handsome one, surmounted by a rustic cross, and beneath is the inscription to the aunt who died in May, 1870, and about whom there is curious family story. the family vault is beneath the church ; but in the building is a very handsome memorial tablet in white marble. The inscription runs—

"In memory of JOHN HAMBROUGH, Esq., of Steephill Castle, in the Isle of Wight, who departed this life on 4th February, 1863, aged 69 years. Also of SOPHIA HAMBROUGH, daughter of George Townsend, Esq., and Lady Elisabeth Townsend, of Honingtee Hall, Warwickshire, wife of the above, who departed this life the 16th February, 1863. seed 70. 'Our light affliction, which is but a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory.'"

AN HISTORIC FAMILY.

The Hambrough family trace their descent back to 1670. Steephill Castle is erected on the site of a rustic thatched villa, built aroiund 1700 by the Right Hon. Hans Stanley when governor of the Island, and at a later period inhabited by an Earl of Dysart. The structure was commenced by J. Hambrough in 1833, and completed in two years. It was designed by Sanderson, the architect of the Ryde Town Hall. The mansion, situated about half a mile from Ventnor, is an imitation of the baronial castles of the reign of Stephen. In the grounds, some seventy or eighty acres in extent, there is an historic well dedicated to St. Lawrence, and a short distance further on is the village of St. Lawrence, the parish of which consists of a strip of land extending about a mile and a half along the seashore. A few years ago the estate was in the books of a Piccadilly agent, the upset price being £30,000.

THE EXHUMATION.

Scotch officials, accompanied by medical expert., arrived at Ventnor, by the 3.30 ',Rent.n train on Monday. They at once Move t the Royal Marine Hotel, where they were met by the Rev. Hall Shaw, the vicar of the parish. The Home Secretary's order was produced mid countersigned by the vicar, and the keys of the churchard were then handed to the Scotch authorities. They were—Mr. J. Maclullich, Procurator Fiscal, Inverary ; Mr. MeNaughton, Deputy Procurator Fiscal ; lie. Littlejohn, at Edinburgh, for the Crown ; Dr. McMillian. Mils fire examined the body and in. Sandscs, M.II , On behalf of the primmer Monroe. Mr. Mediaughton was interviewed by our reporter immediately on his arrival, and stated that the orders they had received to carry out were very altar, and, whilst the Press should have every information, it was desired to keep the churchyard perfectly clear dial., the operation, which would be proceeded with at once. At twenty minutes to five the gravediggers commenced their work, the Deputy Chief Constable and Mr. MeNaughthn being paces Crowds id perms. lined the churchyard well•, and the proceedings ' appeared to arouse a great amount of interest.

MEDICAL OPINIONS.

In any ca., the assignment would be invalid, owing toLieutenantHanabrough being minor. The in.ranoe a...lollies have intimated their willtugnoss to tray over the money as as the peewits legally entitled to it hare been weer. mined. Some little time ago Major Hambrough wrote to the prisoner asking him for the whereabouts of his son. To this communication Monson curtly replied. -Sir.-I am not ann'a keeper. bat I believe be is at Riseley Hall." Thin letter will be predated at tbs trial. M. MOiSON COMMITTED FOR TRIAL. Mr. McTullis+, the Procurator-Fiscal, and his assistant, Mr. McNaughton, arrived from Ventnor at Inverary on Wednesday. Dr. McMillan, of Tichnabruich, who wan the heat medical to me the body at Mr. Hamboruugh, also Ventnor, where he had taken part in the post-mortem examination, and landed at Tichnabruich, settee he resides... They de:shoed to state the result of their visit to the south, but it was underotond to be unfavourable to Mr. Monson. At any rate, Mr. Monson was that afternoon committed for trial oo the charge of murder, and was subsequently removed from Inverary to !Greenock. the date of rem the trial is uncertain. Mr. Monson has all along declined to make any statement. In this lie acts upon the advice of hi. counsel, although at the same time he maintains his entire innocence according to Scotch law, nothing the case is allowed to officially transpire. One fact which has come out very prominently is that Mr. Monson all along been in pecuniary difficulties, although he boasted that there was great wealth at the disposal of himself and Mr. Hambrough. Nothing was ever hinted of his having been adjudged • bank• ' rupt. He produced such ao impression wealth that !there was much competitton for the custom of Ardis:- las:tot House. The story put forth that Mr. Hambrough was to have earned to a quarter of a million it now re; garded a. entirely abautd It is also said that a number of pawnockets were taken possession of by the authorities when they searched Ardlamont Haase. 

ARTISTS AT ARDLAMONT.

Artists are daily arriving at Ardlamont to take sketches of the spot where Mr. Hambrough's dead body was found, but they are not allowed to get near it. Policemen, by order of the Sheriff, guard the place night and day. the authorities being desirous to keep everything intact, particularly a small rows. tree at the foot of which Mr. Ilambrough fell they I my that the twigs are ploughed.. d by the leaden " pellet. front a gun. The watch is to be maintained until the tree and its surroundings have been photographed from every point of view. Neither are sketches of Ardlamont House allowed to be taken, though why not does not appear. tin Wednesday the clamorsa which surround.' the mansion repeatedly broken by the firing of guns; two tithe goads the late Mr. Hambrough, who have remained in the house since his untimely death, were enjoying themselves shooting game in the woods to the west. Not gun has beets fired in the woods to the east, as it is there Mr. Hatobrough met his death. It is curious fact that Mr. Monson wished to insure Mr. Harnbrough's life in the London, Liverpool, and Globe for £50,000, but they declined there was no insurable interest. lle then succeeded in inswing Sr. Hansbrough's life in two sums of Zio,oon each in another office, but he did not disclose the fact that the London, Liverpool, and Globe had declined to Mute • policy, though that is one of the conditions of all insurancos. Another element for enquiry is added to theme. Who took the body to Veatnor is Some of tboae consulted on the point say it Mr. Scott, tboueh they did not enquire aa to his Others think it wu a fourth person. Mr. Stevens, bet be arrived with Mr. Monson. This point is great importance. and will have to be sifted b► dos authorities. It a stated that a warrant has been issued for the arrest of Mr. Scott for whom the police are prosecuting a vigilant search. There was a report in London on Wednesday night that Scott is is hiding there. He is said not to be so engineer at all, but a man about town, and to be well known in a certain fashionable West End bar. He is said to have been lees by several of his companions since the tragedy in Scotland. 

TO DO ABOVE 

REMOVAL OF MR. MONSON.

A special reporter telegraphing from Inverary on Friday, says:— I am assured by a legal gentleman, who has seen the documents, that the assignments of Mr. Hambrough's life policies to Mrs. Monson were out and out assignments, and not merely in the nature of securities. The question of the validity of such assignments does not arise, so long it can be proved that Mr. Monson, with his non-legal mind, thought they were valid. I am told, too, on semiofficial authority, that Mr. McNaughton, the Deputy-Fiscal, upon returning from inspecting the body the day after the tragedy, expressed confidently the opinion that the dead man had not shot himself either accidentally or intentionally. His suspicion of Mr. Monson may of itself account for the shadowing of Mr. Monson for some time before his arrest, but it renders more inexplicable the mistake of Dr Macmillan in giving the report which he subsequently withdrew.

Mr. Monson, handcuffed to a policeman in plain clothes, left Inverary yesterday on the steamer Lord of the Isles. Monson was taken quielty to the vessel 15 minutes before she was timed to start, passing round the back of the town, so to create as little attention as possible. Monson, on boarding the steamer, was immediately placed in the captain's cabin.

One report of the exhumation of the body also described Monson's visit to the Island on Monday, August 21st, when he brought Hambrough's body back to the Island:

THE SCOTCH MYSTERY. EXHUMATION OF LIEUTENANT HAMBROUGH'S BODY.

All arrangements having been completed, the exhumation of the body of Lieutenant Hambrough takes place this afternoon at Ventuor. The grave is in a churchyard which has for some time been disused, except for those having family vaults. It is in the centre busy street, and though the strictest privacy is to observed, the coffin will necessarily be exposed to the public view. For examination it will be removed to the mortuary, where it remained when brought from Scotland.

Mr. Monson when at Ventor was accompanied by person who gave the name of Stevens. They occupied rooms at the Royal Marine Hotel, and an official there states that soon after dinner on the first evening of their stay—Monday, August 21. —Mr. Monson seemed very depressed, and was very unwell, in consequence, he said, of worry through the sad accident, and of having entertained a large party at his castle in Scotland. So bad, indeed, did become that it was found necessary to send for a local doctor, who prescribed for him, and next day was much better. On the Tuesday evening he left the hotel, and proceeded to the station, where he met Lieutenant Hambrough's father, and escorted him to the hotel, where they both remained until after the funeral on Wednesday, when Mr. Monson discharged the account, and they left together. Yesterday a large number of people entered the churchyard look at the grave. Though Mr. Monson visited the vicar at the time of the funeral, that gentleman was unaware of his identity, but believed him to be the Scotch undertaker. Mr. Monson described how the accident was supposed to have happened, his account exactly corresponding with that published. At the graveside the vicar noticed that Mr. Monson was greatly affected, which, to use his own words, surprised him, for he had never seen undertaker weep at a funeral before. Mr. Monson's statement led the vicar to take as his text the following Sunday evening "There is but step between me and death," and in his discourse made special reference to the occurrence, describing it as had been spoken of to him.

The body was brought to Ventnor in charge of a gentleman believed to be the missing Mr. Scott. When asked how the accident occurred, this gentleman said, " I was out with the party, but no one really knows how it happened." Mr. Scott remained till after the funeral.

Mrs. Monson, the wife of the prisoner, is a youngish lady of prepossessing appearance, and is the daughter of Mr. Fisher, a large and well-known colliery proprietor in the Barnsley district of Yorkshire. The publication of the fact in the newspapers that Scott is wanted has resulted in the officials at Inverary being literally deluged with telegrams regarding the movements of men bearing a similar name. None of them, however, referred to the proper person. The authorities are still vigorously prosecuting the search for him.

Ripon Observer - Thursday 13 November 1890

LORD CANTELUPE DROWNED.

Lord Cantelupe has been drowned in Belfast Lough. It seems that at the height of the storm, on Thursday night, the yawl Urania, having on board Viscount Cantelupe, eldest son of Earl Delawarr, was driven ashore. The disaster occurred within a stone's throw of a terrace of houses at the foot of the main street of the village of Bangor. The night was one of the wildest ever remembered in the district. The Urania anchored about 300 yards from the shore on Thursday evening, having arrived during the day from Glasgow, where Lord Cantelupe recently purchased the vessel. As the gale increased in violence,and the sea constantly broke over the Urania, considerable anxiety was felt on shore for the safety of the yawl. At two o'clock yesterday morning signals of distress were sent up from the Urania, and it became evident that she was drifting fast upon the Saltpan Rock. The sea ran so high, the wind was blowing with such terrific force, and the night was so dark, that to launch a boat at that moment would have been reckless folly. The Urania therefore drifted with no hope of assistance from the shore, and finally, about ten minutes past two, struck upon the rocks. Her keel seemed to have struck in a rocky cleft, and in that perilous position she remained for about two hours with the FURIOUS WAVES BREAKING CLEAN OVER HER. It was impossible for any living soul to remain upon the yacht's storm-swept deck, and Lord Cantelupe and his seamen decided to take to the rigging, in which position they would be clear of the waves, although exposed to the furious biting cold wind. The yacht, too, was beginning to till, and it was evident that no time was to be lost. Lord Cantelupe went first, but just as he had reached the top step and was stooping down with a buoy on the arm which clasped the rigging, and the other hand extended to help the next man, a tremendous sea struck the little craft, and the unfortunate young nobleman, who at that moment was cheerily encouraging his men, was SWEPT HEADLONG INTO THE BOILING SURF, and was never seen again. After a few ineffectual attempts the life-line was caught by one of the yacht's crew, and the exhausted storm-beaten seamen were safely hauled ashore after theee hours of very hard work. The body of Lord Cantelupe has not yet been recovered. The young nobleman's untimely end has aroused the greatest sympathy, not only on his own account, but on that of his young wife, to whom he was married only last June. The members of the crew are deeply grieved at the fate of the young nobleman, who during the short time that he was on board had shown a most affable and kindly disposition. Captain Buzzard states that his lordship had hold of a lifebuoy, but just before he was swept overboard he dropped it, probably because his limbs had become numbed by the cold.

Viscountess Cantelupe is at present staying with her mother at Wallhampton Park, Lymington. The deceased was only 24 years of age.

THE SCOTCH SHOOTING MYSTERY. EXHUMATION OF THE BODY

THE SCOTCH SHOOTING MYSTERY. EXHUMATION OF THE BODY Monday afternoon last the remains of the late Lieutenant Windsor Cecil Dudley Hambrough, who was believed to have been accidentally shot at Ardlamont, Scotland, were exhumed in the churchyard of St. Catherine's Yontnor, by order of the Home Secretary. Shortly after four o'clock Mr. J. C. Ma- Culloch, of Inverary, procurator fiscal, and Mr. M'Naughton, deputy procurator fiscal of Argyllshire, arrived with the authority of the Home Secretary. They were accompanied by Dr. Littlejohn, of Edinburgh, and Dr. McMillan, the gentleman who examined the body before burial, appointed to examine to remains on behalf of the Crown and Dr. Sanders, of Edinburgh, who was present behalf of the accused man, Monson. Dr. Whitehead, of Ventnor, afterwards joined them, in the interests of the Hambrough family. Major Hambrough arrived at Ventor in time to witness from the high road the excavation in the graveyard. In answer to enquiries Major Hambrough confirmed the statement that two insurances for ten thousand pounds each were effected on his son's life, and assigned to Mrs. Monson, and not to Mr. Monson. Beyond this he declined to commit himself to any statement, remarking that in sense he was the hands of the police, and did not feci at liberty to make any observations with regard to the case. The body was encased iv a massive oak coffin with silver mountings. On its removal from the grave it was placed in hearse, and taken to the mortuary at Ventnor Cemetery. which is situated on the upper range of hills, in line with St. Boniface own. It is understood that some astounding revelations re imminent. A Ventnor correspondent says :— are leaking out concerning the post-mortem examination Lieutenant JFLypbrQugh's. it now open secret that, the the mo3icß,l zperts, the fatal shot was fired a distance of lot less than fourteen paces and the fact of the pelets striking the back of the head, inflicting almost mrizontal wound, extending from the base of the rente to the centre of the ear, which was tho highest lart, is considered against the theory that the debased could have shot himself either accidentally or ntentionally. Then, again, the pellets were discovered embedded in trees about on a level with Hambrough's lead, an additional proof that the gun must have been lischarged in a horizontal direction. In reference o the alleged exchange guns, since Monsoon's arrest sixteen cartridges mad» with ordinary gunpowder, of the same bore as hi» own gun, were found in the leceased's shooting jacket, and among them was not one amberite cartridge*, whereas the prisoner stated that the deceased waf** shooting at Ardlamont with his (the prisoner's) gun atfd using amberite cartridges. The appearance of thewound, too, is consistent with belief that smokeless powder such as amberite lad been used in the cartridge. No wad at all was 'ound in the wound, showing that the fatal shot was lot fired close to the head. The operative work of autopsy was performed by Dr. Littlejohn with great skill. With reference to the large life insurances, reason for their assignment to Mrs. Monson may be 'oundin the fact that tbe prisener is an undischarged Dankrnpt; but in any case, the assignment would be nvalid, owing to Lieutenant Hambrough being a minor. The insurance companies have intimated heir willingness to pay over the moneys as soon as he persons legally entitled to them have been ascertained. Some little time ago Major Hambrough wrote to the prisoner asking him for the whereabouts of his son. To this communication Monson curtly eplied, '"Sir, I am not your son's keeper, but I be•eve he at Riseley Hall." This letter.it is said, will be produced. The Procurator Fiscal and deputy, with medical witnesses, left Ventnor at twenty minutes past seven on Tuesday morning for Glasgow" THE SCENE OF THE FATALITY. The scene of the shooting fatality is carefully guarded, no person being allowed to approach it. It about a quarter of a mile from Ardlamont House, and the stone wall, about which so much has been said, reached on one side by squeezing through the two arms of a tree growing on the top. Twelve yards further along is the spot where the body was found, now marked by decayed ferns. At hand is ash tree about six feet hign. Several branches of a tree close to the place have been cut down to be produced in the case. These branches are said to near the marks of having been pierced pellets. The question rises whether anyone witnessed the fatality. The prisoner Monson states that he and Scott were among the trees of larger growth, out of sight, the one carrying the 20-bore gun and tho other a few rabbits. They heard shot fired, and, rushing forward to see what success had attended the shot, they found Mr. Hambrough lying dead on the top of the wall. But a third person heard the shot—a gentleman who occupied the neighbouring schoolhouse for the month. The next thing he heard was that fatality had occurred. Mrs. Monson is black-eyed, rather dark lady, looking few years over 30, with good appearance, except for hopkish nose and erratic carriage, which indicates that the silver-mounted ebony walking-stick she carried not only for ornament. The statement which has been ftiven out that she was Miss Fisher is incorrect, the Pal! Mall Gazette says; she is undoubtedly the daughter of a colliery owner, but Mr. Steven, the factor of the Ardlamont estate, says that he is not at liberty to state who she is. Mrs. Monson told him there was no occasion to mention her former A shockingly tragic affair occurred on Tuesday morning, at Wallhampton. Henry Carr, gamekeeper in the employ of Mr. J. P. Haseltine, was talking to the landlord of a local public-house, when the conversation turned upon the Ardlamont sheoting mystery. Carr insisted that it was possible that Lieut. Hambrough's injuries were self-inflicted, and, in order to demonstrate this, he took up his gun, placed it behind his back with one hand, and reaching down the other hand, pulled the trigger. The gun happened to be loaded, and Carr blew the top of his skull off.

Around the country, readers were now presented with the idea that Monson had some strange hold over Hambrough, or at least, so his father believed:

THE ARDLAMONT MYSTERY.  
STATEMENT BY MAJOR HAMBROUGH. 

The *Glasgow Citizen* of last evening publishes a report of an interview with Major Hambrough at Glasgow, on his return from Inverary on Tuesday. After contradicting the statement that he had leased a shooting estate in Wigtonshire, where a gun accident happened in 1880, Major Hambrough, who has never been in Scotland until the present occasion, said he was introduced to Mr. Monson in June, 1890, by Mr. Tottenham, and that, being satisfied that Monson was a capable tutor, he placed his son Cecil under his charge. Major Hambrough, being of a Hants family, was desirous that Cecil should join a Hampshire regiment; but, contrary to his wishes, Monson entered the lad in the Yorkshire Militia. The father was opposed to this at first, but ultimately agreed, on the understanding that when the Militia training was over his son should be transferred to the Hampshire Regiment. This training was over in June. Major Hambrough continued:—

Of course, I am now speaking of 1892. I never saw Cecil until September, when he came home for a week. As he brought no luggage,he left for the nurpose of bringing his things from Riseley Hall, promising faithfully to his mother that he would return. I saw nothing more of him till January of this year. In the interval we had sent numerous letters and telegrams to Riseley Hall. Some of these we think, he never got, for he was very much attached to his mother, and his long absence and silence were unnatural. He answered one or two telegrams, but the reply was always the same "I cannot come to-day." Some time in January I got to hear, through a friend, that my son was in London. I went up the same night to fetch him. Next morning I found him at the Metropole, and, after much trouble, got him to go home with me. Both Mr. Monson and his wife were there, but I was so indignant because of their conduct that I had little to say to them. The next I heard of my son was that he was going North for a week's fishing. My idea of Monson was that he was in league with money-lenders. To us it seemed so strange and unnatural, so unlike my son's previous conduct when at home, that he should forget his parents, his home, and his repeated assurances of affection, whenever he left us and went back to those people, that I can only suppose he had been hypnotised. It was a fortnight after I had heard that Cecil was at Ardlamont that I discovered that Monson was with him. Then we got a telegram to the effect that Cecil had been wounded by a gunshot accident, and we were asked to come North. This telegram stated that Mr. Mormon would meet me on arrival at Glasgow. At the Kings-cross Station I telegraphed to Mr. Monson—" Wire me care of Station Master, Newcastle, how Cecil is, and nature of accident." At Newcastle I ascertained that no message had come for me. We arrived in Glasgow at six o 'clock, but Mr. Monson did not meet us, as promised in his telegram to Dr. Hambleten. We walked to the hotel here, and, leaving my wife in the coffee-room, I immediately despatched another telegram to Mr. Monson, repeating the message sent from London. I then returned to the hotel, and on entering the coffee-room I met a waiter with a copy of the *Citzen*. I borrowed the paper, and read the lines "Sad shooting accident. Young gentleman shot dead at Ardlamont." Mrs. Hambrough saw by the expression on my face that something was wrong, and asked me if I had any particulars. I thought it best to tell her the worst, and read to her the heading of the paragraph. On hearing that Cecil was dead she screamed and fainted. Shortly after this I received a telegram from Mr. Monson :—"Wired you full particulars to Newcastle. Come on at once." That same evening I got a telegram from Mr. Monson :—" Prepare for the worst;" and later I received, "Cecil's accident fatal." Next morning we left by the five minutes past ten train for Greenock, and Mr. Monson met us on the platform at Prince's Pier. He appeared so deeply affected that all our bitter feelings against him were removed. I said to my wife :—" This man is punished sufficiently," and then we shook hands with him. We got to Tighnavruaich between two and three o'clock in the afternoon. Mrs. Monson was there, and she also displayed the greatest possible grief.

Had you any ides of foul play at that time?

Not the slightest, or I would not have stayed a moment in the house with them. I saw the body before and after it was placed in the coffin, and got explanations which at the time appeared to be satisfactory. I did not see the wound. One of the questions I put to Mr. Monson was : " Are there any insurances ?" and he replied that there was none. I wanted to see Scott, but could not find him. I also tried to see the doctor, but failed. Mr. Monson informed me that Scott lived in Glasgow, and that I could see him there on my return. I came to Glasgow, but could not find him. I first heard of the insurance policies in London, the day that Mr. Monson was arrested. That was the first intimation I had of any suspicion against Mr. Monson.

In reply to the question why he had not appealed to the law for power to compel his son to leave Monson and come home, the Major explained that an idea had occurred to him and to other members of the family, and that he had actually taken preliminary steps in that direction; but he was restrained from applying to the Court in consideration of his son's repeated promises to come home, and the fact that his legal advisers pointed out to him that, owing to Cecil's approaching majority, the Court would probably not interfere. He was influenced in the choice of Monson as his son's tutor by the fact that he was highly recommended.

As to the two insurance policies of 10,000*l*. each, said to be assigned to Mrs. Monson, Major Hambrough is advised that his son, being a minor, could not enter into any legal contract, and consequently the money will be paid to the next-of-kin. The next heir to the Hambrough estates is a little boy three and a half years of age, he and two daughters being the remaining members of Major Hambmugh's family.

Further progress was made yesterday by the Procurator Fiscal in the work of precognosing witnesses in connection with the death of Lieutenant Hambrough. Mr. M'Naughton. the Deputy Procurator Fiscal, accompanied by Constable Campbell, drove out to Ardlamont from Tignabruaich. Here they were joined by Mr. Maclullich, the Procurator Fiscal, who had been conveyed across from Ardrishaig. It is stated that the house servants were first questioned, then the estate hands. James Wright, the butler in the house, was among those examined. He arrived at Ardlamont the night before the shooting accident. It was he who supplied the refreshments to Hambrough, Monson, and Scott early in the morning, after the boating misadventure. After his examination he was taciturn, but it could be gathered in the course of conversations about the house, that on the morning of August 10 Wright was thunderstruck when Mr. Monson and Scott walked into the dining-room, where he was; and when Mr. Monson informed him that "Hambrough was shot," Scott was carrying rabbits, and these he handed to the butler. Apprehending that Lieutenant Hambrough had been shot in the shrubbery outside the house, Wright ran out to search for him, but when he could not find him he returned to the house and told Mr. Monson that the search had been fruitless. Mr. Monson then said, " Come, and I will show you the spot," or used words of like import. Mr. Monson and Wright then proceeded into the wood, and passing the offices Mr. Monson called Archibald White and Hugh Carmichael to follow. Wright was the first to see the body. Mr Hambrough was lying partly on the left side. His head lay on his left shoulder. His left hand was across the breast, and the right was extended by his side. His legs were slightly drawn up. The head was towards the rowan tree, and was about eight feet from it. There were no guns lying about.

THE SCOTCH MYSTERY

MAJOR HAMBROUGH'S VIEWS. HYPNOTISM SUGGESTED.

A reporter of a Glasgow evening paper has had an interview with Major Hambrouph, the father of the late Lieutenant Hambrough, and some remarkable statements are the result. It appears that Major Hambrough was introduced to Mr. Monson in 1892, and in that year placed his son under his care as tutor, being influenced to take this course by Monson's high recommendations and his aristocratic connections. After he joined Monson the family, however, saw  little of the deceaeed, and were very much concerned at the fact that he did not visit home. They had even taken preliminary steps in an appeal to the law to compel Lieutenant Hambrough to leave Monson, but the proceedings were dropped, because of the young man's repeated promises to return home, and because of the feeling that the courts would not interfere in view of the fact that he had nearly attained his majority. In reply to the question. "How do you account for the extraordinary influence which three people possessed over your son?" the Major said. "I'm a believer in hypnotism, and strange to say, the doctor at Inverary to-day was of the same opinion. To us it seemed strange and unnatural, so unlike his  
PREVIOUS CONDUCT WHEN AT HOME,  
that he should forget his parents, his home, and his repeated assurance of affection whenever left us, and went back to these people." Continuing, Major Hambrough stated that he and his wife heard that deceased and Monson were at Ardlamont, and then came a telegram announcing that he had been wounded in a gun accident, and that Monson would meet them in Glasgow. They started for the North—Major Hambrough being convinced that his son was dead, though he did not communicate this suspicion to his wife. "At King's Cross Station. London (he continued), I telegraphed to Mr. Monson, 'Wire me, care of stationmaster Newcastle, how Cecil is, and nature of accident'. At Newcastle, I ascertained on inquiry that no wire had come for me. We arrived in Glasgow at six o'clock, but Mr. Monson did not meet us as promised in his telegram." From a copy of an evening paper, which he saw at a Glasgow hotel, Major Hambrough learnt that his son had been shot dead, and later received a telegram from Monson which said: "Wired you full particulars at Newcastle, come on once."— Have you satisfied your self since that no such wire was sent? Only by inquiring on arrival from London.—Then you have not inquired when passing through Newcastle on subsequent occasions? No, there was no necessity. Monson had plenty of time to answer my telegram between the hour of my departure from London and my arrival at Newcastle. That same evening I got a telegram from Mr. Monson,  
"PREPARE FOR THE WORST,"  
and later I received another wire, "Cecil' accident fatal." Next morning we left with the 10-5 train for Greenock, and when Monson met us on the platfom at Prince's Pier he appeared so deeply to be affected that all our bitter feeling against him was removed. I said to my wife. " This man is punished sufficiently," and then shook hands with him, We got to Tighnabruaich between two and three o'clock in the afternoon. Mrs. Monson was there and she also displayed the greatest possible grief. Had you any idea of foul play at the time? Not the slightest, I would not have stayed a moment in the house with them. I saw the body before and after it was placed the coffin, and got explanations which at the time appeared satisfactory. I did not see the wound. One the questions I put to Mr. Monson was, "Are there any insurances?" He answered me there were none. —Did you see Scott when at Ardlamont? I wanted to see Scott, but could not find him. I also tried see the doctor. But failed. Mr. Monson informed me that Scott lived in Glasgow, and that I could see him there on my return. I came to Glasgow, but could not find him.—When, may I ask, did you first hear of the insurance policies? I heard of the insruance policies in London, on the same day that Mr. Monson was arrested. That was the first intimation I had of any suspicion against Mr. Monson.

LIEUT. HAMBROUGH'S DEATH. EXAMINATION OF WITNESSES

The special correspondent of the *Daily Telegraph* at Tighnabruaich says that further progress was made on Wednesday by the Procurator-Fiscal in the work of precognoscing witnesses in connection with the mysterious death of Lieutenant Hambrough at Ardlamont on August 10th. Almost every person on the estate who was at the house, or near the offices, or who had any dealings with the shooting tenants has been examined. For the purposes of the inquiry the smoking-room on the ground floor of the west wing of the house was set apart. First the house servants were questioned, and then the estate hands. Those examined were afterwards extremely reticent. Miss Edith Haron, the governess, gave her evidence in the most intelligent manner. Her examination was a long and exhaustive one. Having been several years in the Monson family, she was able to give the Fiscal much information with respect to the relations subsisting between Hambrough and the Monsons, and she likewise had a good deal to relate regarding what occurred after Scott's arrival, and on the morning of Lieutenant Hambrough's death.— James Wright, the butler in the house, was also examined. He arrived at Ardlamont the night before the shooting accident. It was he who supplied the refreshments to Hambrough, Monson, and Scott early in the morning after the boating misadventure. His evidence will be of the utmost importance with regard to the events immediately succeeding the gun accident. After his examination he was extremely taciturn, but it could be gathered in the course of conversations about the house, that on the morning of August 10th Wright was thunderstruck when Monson and Scott walked into the dining-room where he was, and Mr. Monson informed him that "Hambrough was shot." Scott was carrying rabbits, and these he handed to the butler. Apprehending that Lieut. Hambrough had been shot in the shrubbery outside the house, Wright ran out to search for him, but when he could not find him he returned to the house and told Mr. Monson that the search had been fruitless. Mr. Monson then said, "Come and I will shew you the spot," or used worss of like import. Monson and Wright then proceeded into the wood, and passing the offcies Monson called Archibald White and Hugh Carmichael to follow. Wright was the first to see the body. Hambrough was lying partly on the left side. His head lay on his left shoulder. His left hand was across the breast, and his right was extended by his side. His legs were slightly drawn up. The head was toward the rowan tree, and was about eight feet from it. There were no guns lying about.— Jessie McLeod, housemaid; Janet Guinea, kitchen-maid, Alexandrina Shand, nursemaid, and Flora McKinnon, cook, were also examined. One of the witnesses produced the cap worn by the deceased on the fatal morning. It was, upon examination, found to have a pellet mark on the right side. The cap will be one of the "productions " in the case. Another is said to be the jacket which was found below the upturned boat in the bay. It was one of Hambrough's jackets, and is of a light check pattern. Several of the witnesses who saw and spoke with Scott have been shown a photograph said to be his, which had evidently been found in the house. It is that of a rather good-looking young man, with broad forehead, aquiline nose, and slight moustache. One or two of the witness's cannot positively say that it is that of the man wanted but the police are believed to be following up the clue which the name of the photographer on the card affords. After the exaumination of the house servants, the estate lands were examined, including Donald M'Intyre and George Lamont, the gamekeepers, who spoke concerning the guns used by the party on the 10th; Archibald White, the gardener; Hugh Carmichael, the ploughman ; Stewart M'Nicol, the joiner, and Hugh Carmichael, jun., the coachman who drove Scott to the pier on the day of his departure.
