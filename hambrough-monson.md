Dundee Evening Telegraph - Saturday 12 August 1893

YOUNG GENTLEMAN SHOT DEAD IN BUTE.

A sad shooting fatality happened on Thursday the estate Ardlament, some distance from Tighnabruaich. Mr Hambro *[sic]*, a young gentleman of 23 years, who is believed to have been a banker in America, and who was joint-tenant of the Ardlamont shootings along with Mr Monson, was shot dead while out shooting rabbits. The young gentleman was crossing dyke with his loaded gun, which he was carrying under his arm at full-cock. It is supposed that the trigger was caught bv the bushes, and this, it is believed, caused the gun accidentally to go off. The charge lodged in the unfortunate gentleman's head, and he was killed on the spot. His friends coming up immediately afterwards were too late to render any assistance. The body was removed to House, which is at present in the possession of the shooting tenants. The sad occurrence has cast a gloom over the district. Mr Hambro hod been staying at Ardlamout with his friend Mr Monson during the past three or four weeks.

The death of young Mr Hambrough, says the *N.B. Mail*, at Ardlament is singalany sad. He seemed to be one of " Fortune's children," with a life of happiness and ease before him. Had he lived till April next he would have attained his majority and inherited a fortune of about a quarter of a million, some £70,000 of which would probably have been devoted to the purchase of the Ardlamont estate, to which he had taken a strong liking since he became the shooting tenant a few months ago. Mr Hambro was a well-built, handsome young fellow, and his simple, frank, and courteous manners had already won him many friends in the district.

The Ardlamont Mystery

MONSON BEFORE THE SHERIFF

THE INSURANCE QUESTION.

SCOTT STILL LARGE.

Mr Alfred Monson was yesterday brought before Sheriff Shairp in the Courthouse, Inveraray, and judicially examined on the charge of causing the death of Mr Windsor Dudley Cecil Hamhrough, by shooting, at Ardlamont, on the 10th of the present month. After emitting his declaration, the accused was committed to prison for further examination. It is probable that he will brought up for his second examination after a lapse of eight days, and if he is then committed to prison he will be removed to Greenock, there to await his trial.

Accused in Prison.

Mr Monson is meantime living comfortably, if not luxuriously, at his own expense. His meals are brought into him from the George Hotel, which adjoins the Courthouse. On Wednesday he had a dinner of three courses. He had tea in the evening, and breakfast was carried to him before nine o'clock yesterday morning. In other respects he is being treated as an ordinary prisoner. He sleeps in his clothes on the raised wooden bed-shaped arrangement on the floor of the cell, with a couple of blankets thrown over him. He is said to be now feeling his position, it is believed, very keenly. While under police surveillance from Monday night till Wednesday morning his behaviour savoured something of bravado. On Tuesday he was out shooting on the moor in the company of some of his guests with a policeman walking on each side of him, and he drove about, dined, and slept constantly shadowed by representatives of the law, and never once did he show the least sign of annoyance or discomposure.

APPLICATION TO HOME SECRETARY.

The criminal authorities are preparing precognitions to be laid before Crown counsel. An application has been made to the Home Secretary for authority to exhume the remains of the young gentleman who is alleged have been murdered. Mr Hambrough's body was buried in the Isle of Wight in the family burial-ground there, and an official from Inveraray will go through to the Isle Wight to superintend the exhuming and examination the remains. From hints which have been dropped since Monson’s arrest, it is believed that, if the case goes to trial at all, the evidence will be of a rather sensational nature. It is now stated that Monson was not Hambrough’e legal guaidiau all, but only his tutor.

WARRANT TOR ARREST.

A warrant for the arrest the missing engineer, Edward Scott, was signed Wednesday night.

THE ACCUSED.

Alfred John Monson is the third son of the late Rev. Thomas John Monson, rector of Kirby-under-Dale. Yorkshire, his mother being the daughter of the fifth Viscount Galway. He was born in May, 1858, and is thus in his thirty-fourth year. Mr Monson is a member of the family of which Viscount Oxenbridge, the Master of the Horse, is the head, his grandfather, the Hon. and Rev. Thomas Monson, rector of Bedale, having been a son of the second Baron Monson, and the grand-uncle of the present peer.

THE DECEASED

Windsor Dudley Cecil Hambrough was thee eldest son of Dudley Albert Hambroug, Esq., of Steephill Castle, Isle of Wight. He was bron in 1873, and would have attained his majority early next year. He was a Lieutenant in the 4th Battalion Prince of Wales' Own Yorkshire Regiment. Lieutenant Hambrough’s father is a J.P. for Hants and the patron of two livings, and resides principally at Houghton, Stockbridge.

THE TRUE STORY OF THE INSURANCE

From a thoroughly reliable source the Glasgow *Evening Citizen* has learned all about the insurance negotiations, concerning which no end of rumours have been in circulation. Mr Hambrough being desirous of insuring his life approached the Mutual Life Assurance Society, of New York, through their Glasgow office, and, after the usual preliminaries of examination and references, a policy or policies amounting to £20,000 were taken out. When the insurance was being effected it was understood by the representatives of the Company that the policy was to be assigned to Mr Monson, with whom, indeed, there were one or more interviews on the subject. The question naturally arises, why should Mr Hambrough ASSIGN THE POLICY TO HIS FRIEND Mr Monson? The explanation seems a reasonable one. Mr Hambrough was desirous of purchasing the Ardlamont estate, and required money for this purpose. Although having the prospect of great wealth when he came of age, Mr Hambrough was not, in the meantime, in the possession of much money, and, as it was, was indebted to his friend Monson. The latter gentleman himself is reported not to be rich, but his wife is stated to be wealthy. Indeed, it is said that the intention first was to assign the policy to this lady and her children as the advances for the acquiring of the estate to be made out of her money. As events turned out, THE POLICY NEVER WAS ASSIGNED.

And for the best of all reasons — it had not been received from the head office in New York, and, of course, no transfer could take place without the principal document. Mr Hambrough had merely received a receipt or covering note pending the arrival of the policy. This, then, leads directly the conclusion that Mr Monson can derive no pecuniary benefit from the death of Mr Hambrough. Whatever may have been the intentions of the contracting parties, there has been no assignation whatever of the policy, and whoever the Mutual Life Aseurance Society of New York pay the £20,000 to it will certainly not be Mr Monson, but the relatives of the deceased gentleman.

TRAGIC SHOOTTNQ ACCIDENT.

The Press Association's Lymington correspondent telegraphs.— A tragically shocking affair occurred this morning at Wallhampton. Henry Card, a gamekeeper in the employ of Mr. J. W.

The gun happened to be loaded, and Card blew the top of his skull off. He is not dead yet, but the doctors state that it will be impossible for him to recover.
