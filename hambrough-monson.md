 # Ardlamont Murder

I discovered this tale, in a roundabout way, from a notice of a strange occurrence at the end of the 19th century that took place, suposedly, in what is now [*The Ferryman*](https://ferrymanlymington.com/) pub, at Lymington.

```{admonition} Tragedy — In the Tap Room

```

> Way back in 1893, on September 5th, there was a shooting tragedy in this, the "Waggon and Horses" Inn, Walhampton, of which a local gamekeeper, 38 years old Henry Card, who lived at Snooke's farm, was the victim. He was in the service of Mr. J.P. Heseltine of Walhampton House, a former High Sheriff of the county of Southampton.
>
> The tragedy occurred at the time of the mystery of what was known as the Ardlamont Shooting Case, which set a problem as to whether Lieutenant Hambrough, (who was buried at Ventnor, I. O. W.), could have shot himself from behind. There was news that Lieutenant Hambrough's body was to be exhumed, and Lymington was sharing the widespread public interest in the case. The topic arose when Henry Card walked into the Tap-room of the "Waggon" shortly before midday and ordered a "pint". He carried a double-barrelled gun which, although apparently believed to be empty, was shown by subsequent events to have been fully loaded.
>
> It was a Mr. John Bligh, a London visitor to the inn, who raised the subject of the Adlamont case. He read of it, from a newspaper, to Mr. Card. And when another customer in the bar remarked that an old keeper in Scotland had said that it was impossible for Lieutenant Hambrough to have shot himself, Henry Card disagreed.
>
> What then happened was described by Mr. Bligh at an inquest, which was held here, in the inn, on Sept. 7th, 1893. He said that Mr. Card invited him to try the experiment, saying, "There's my gun; it is empty." Mr. Bligh did not accept, and Mr. Card put down the dog he was nursing and picked up the gun. Mr. Bligh stated that he heard Mr. Card cock the gun and saw him eventually place the gun behind his back with his right hand close to the trigger and the muzzle pointing towards his head. "Then he fired and the explosion came", said Mr. Bligh. Mr. Card, he went on, then put the gun down on the table before falling to the floor.
>
> The game-keeper had received mortal head-wounds. Two doctors were summoned to him, but, as the Press of the day related, early that afternoon, "the poor fellow breathed his last.
>
> "The tragic circumstances surrounding his death," stated the Press, "have evoked the deepest sympathy towards his sorrowing widow, who has thus suddenly been left to battle with the work alone for herself and nine orphans left behind."

So what was the *Ardlamont Shooting Case*, aka the *Ardlament Mystery*, or the *Monson Case*?

The story begins with newspaper reports in mid-August, 1893, of what appears to be an unfortunate shooting accident:

YOUNG GENTLEMAN SHOT DEAD IN BUTE.

A sad shooting fatality happened on Thursday the estate Ardlament, some distance from Tighnabruaich. Mr Hambro *[sic]*, a young gentleman of 23 years, who is believed to have been a banker in America, and who was joint-tenant of the Ardlamont shootings along with Mr Monson, was shot dead while out shooting rabbits. The young gentleman was crossing dyke with his loaded gun, which he was carrying under his arm at full-cock. It is supposed that the trigger was caught bv the bushes, and this, it is believed, caused the gun accidentally to go off. The charge lodged in the unfortunate gentleman's head, and he was killed on the spot. His friends coming up immediately afterwards were too late to render any assistance. The body was removed to House, which is at present in the possession of the shooting tenants. The sad occurrence has cast a gloom over the district. Mr Hambro hod been staying at Ardlamout with his friend Mr Monson during the past three or four weeks.

The death of young Mr Hambrough, says the *N.B. Mail*, at Ardlament is singularly sad. He seemed to be one of " Fortune's children," with a life of happiness and ease before him. Had he lived till April next he would have attained his majority and inherited a fortune of about a quarter of a million, some £70,000 of which would probably have been devoted to the purchase of the Ardlamont estate, to which he had taken a strong liking since he became the shooting tenant a few months ago. Mr Hambro was a well-built, handsome young fellow, and his simple, frank, and courteous manners had already won him many friends in the district.

ARDLAMONT SHOOTING FATALITY. 

Investigation by the Fiscal. (*By Telegraph.*)  
DUNOON, 3.—Mr McNaughton, the deputy-Fiscal for Argyllshire, arrived in Dunoon this morning, after completing his investigation into the sad affair which occurred at Ardlamont on Thursday morning. The unfortunate young gentleman who met such an untimely end was only 20 years of age, and a lieutenant in the 3rd West Yorkshire Militia, his full name being Windsor Dudley Cecil Harmborough (*sic*). His father is Major Hamborough, of the same regiment. From the information now to hand, it appears that on the morning of the 10th August young Mr Hamborough went out about half-past six to shoot in a plantation close to Ardlamont House. He was accompanied by Alfred John Morrison (*sic*), his guardian, and Mr Edward Scott, engineer, Glasgow, the latter going out with the intention of carrying the game. Both Mr Hamborough and Mr Morrison had guns. In going through the plantation they separated, and in a few minutes time Mr Morrison heard a shot fired. He called out to Mr Hamborough, asking what he had_killed, but received no reply. Running in the direction from where the shot came, he was horrified to find the poor lad lying on his left side in a ditch with a gunshot wound immediately behind the left ear, the brains protruding. The gun was lying beside him. He was quite dead, No one saw the accident, and how it was caused will never be known. It is thought that he must have been walking along a dyke, which forms a sort of breast-wall, and slipped, the gun going off he fell.

The affair is one of the most lamentable that has ever happened in the district, and has cast a gloom over the whole place. The young gentleman's brother officers arrived at Ardlamont House later in the day for the purpose of enjoying a few days' shooting, and received a great shock on being informed that their friend was dead. Had Hamborough lived till he attained his majority he would have come in for a fortune of over a quarter of a million. He and Mr Morrison had just purchased the Ardlamont estate a week ago. The deceased lad's father and mother will arrive at Ardlamont today.

The death of "Mr Hambro" was also reported in the *Portsmouth Evening News*: "Mr Hambro" was, in fact, Lietentant Hambrough, scion of a notable family on the Isle of Wight:

THE COUNTY GENTLEMAN.

...

The sad accident by which Mr. Hamborough, of Ardlamont, in carrying his gun over a fence on his Argyllshire shooting, lost his life, has come as a reminder to some careless gunners that even in these days of patent intercepting safety blocks, automatic ejectors, and hammerless central fires, it is wise to cultivate a wholesome fear of the reckless use of firearms. Young gunners particularly are too apt to treat their central fires as if they were harmless walking-sticks. Natural carelessness prevents them appreciating risks to their friends or to themselves ; and though loading and unloading has now become so exceedingly easy it never occurs to them to beware of unloading in dangerous places, where a slip or a stumble may send them and their gun rolling over together, or in placing their weapons aside during lunch to be careful to extract the cartridges beforehand. Improvements have taken away seventy-five per cent. of the risk of accidents undertaken by our grandfathers, but the risk remaining, small as it is, should not be increased by the recklessness of headlong gunners, who forget, or have never learned, the danger of treating a central-fire as if it were a plaything. Gun accidents on the whole now are very infrequent, but it is only by a due exercise of sportmanlike carefulness that they can be kept from increasing in number.

A couple of weeks later, however, and rumours were starting to circulate:

THE ARDLAMONT SHOOTING FATALITY 

According to rumour pretty current in the Ardlament district, a new and startling development has taken place in regard the fatal shooting accident which occurred there nearly three weeks ago. It may be recalled that the story was that on the 10th of the present month Mr Hambro, the young gentleman, who had just attained his majority, was out shooting rabbits. It was said he was not proficient in handling a gun, and that while crossing a dyke his foot slipped, and the gun went off, all the contents lodging in his head. No one, however, seems to have been beside the unfortunate lad at the time, and it is now whispered that the gunshot wound did not appear to be such as an accident could account for. nor such as he could well have inflicted upon himself. The sheriff and a doctor and police officials visited the scene of the occurence on Saturday, and it is reported that the body of the deceased gentleman is to exhumed. It also appears that on the Tuesday prior to the accident young Hambro had a narrow escape from drowning. He was out boating, when the craft either sank or capsized. He was unable to swim, but was picked up by a gentleman who was fishing in the neighbourhood.

THE ARDLAMONT SHOOTING FATALITY.

Yesterday Captain Fraser, chief-constable for Argyllshire; Mr MacNaughton, deputy-fiscal for the county; and a police official from Gourock visited Ardlamont, Kyles of Bute, with the view of making further investigations regarding the sad death of Lieutenant Windsor Cecil Dudley Hamborough, of the West Yorkshire Militia, who was shot dead while out rabbit-shooting on the Ardlamont Estate on the morning of the 1Oth inst. The young gentleman's death, together with many strange rumours regarding it which are current in the Ardlamont district, has thrown the whole neighbourbood into a state of great excitement.

It will be remembered that on the morning of the 10th inst. Mr Hamborough. went out about half-past six to shoot in a plantation close to Ardlamont House. He was accomipanied by Mr Alfred John Monson, his guardian, and Mr Edward Scott, an engineer, the latter going out with the intention of carrying the game. Both Mr Hanmborough and Mr Monson had guns. In going through the plantation they separated, and in a few minutes' time Mr Monson heard a shot fired. He called out te Mr Hamborough, askise what he had killed, but received no reply, Running in the direction from where the shot came, he was horrified to find the poor lad lying on his left side in a ditch with a gunshot wound immediately behind the left ear, the brains protruding.

A new and startling development has taken place with regard to the tragic affair, inasmuch as Mr Scott has left. Inquiries are being made to ascertain his whereabouts, and it is hoped that, if found, he may be able to throw light on the mystery. It is said that Mr Hamborough was a novice with the gun, and that while going over a dyke his foot slipped and the gun went off. It is now rumnoured that the gunshot wound did not appear to be such as an accident of the kind could account for, nor such as he could have inflicted upon himself, the shot having entered the back of the left ear in a horizontal position. It is also rumoured that the company in which the deceased gentleman was insured had refused to pay the amount of the policy, but on inquiry we learn that up to the present time no claim has been lodged with the insurance company. The deceased gentleman had a narrow escape from drowning on the evening prior to his death.

Reports started to emerge about renewed official interest in the case:

THE ARDLAMONT SHOOTING CASE

Extraordinary Developments.  
Renewed Investigation the Police.  
(*From Our Special Reporter.*)  
TIGHNABRUAICH, Tuesday Morning.

Within the past few days the Ardlamont shooting case, briefly commented upon by the newspapers a fortnight ago as an unfortunate accident presenting no suspicious features, has been magnified in the eyes the people of Ardlamont, Dunoon, Tighnabruaich, and the neighbourhood into something approaching a tragedy. This new, and so far, unjustifiably extravagant view of the case has been the result of certain unusual steps on the part of the police authorities of the County of Argyll, in which the affair occurred. It is but right say at the outset that up till last night no evidence had been brought forward satisfactorily discrediting the hypothesis first formed that Mr Hamborough, the unfortunate victim of the accident of 10th inst., was killed by the accidental discharge of his own gun. The Argyllshire police authorities, however, would appear to consider that they have got upon the track of a serious crime, judging from the extraordinary and elaborate investigations and experiments they have been making in the course of the past week. At the present moment the entire criminal administration of the county massed on Ardlamont. The Sheriff-Substitute of the county, Mr Campbell Shairp, along with the Procurator-Fiscal, J. C. M'Lullich, and his deputy, Mr Thomas M'Naughton from Inveraray, as well as the Chief Constable of the county, Mr Fraser, from Lochgilphead, proceeded to Tighnabruaich yesterday afternoon in order to make the third investigation into all the details of the unfortunate incident. The whole district is accordingly in a state of intense excitement regarding the ultimate outcome of these police measures, and the wildest rumours are prevalent.

So briefly and so inaccurately was the affair of the 10th inst. reported that it may be well to give, even at this date,  
A CORRECT AND FULL ACCOUNT  
of it. At the outset is necessary to explain that the estate of Ardlamont is in the market for sale. It is an extensive and beautiful tract of country between Tighnabruaich and Lochfyne, and the passenger through the Kyles of Bute sees the southern extremity of it at the prominent portion of the northern mainland familiar as Ardlamont Point. The estate, according to the recent valuation, is worth about £82,000, and the upset price which it has been offered is £8O,OOO. A prospective purchaser of this old historic Cowal estate came forward last spring in the person of Mr Alfred John Monson, a Yorkshire gentleman, who now occupies the most unpleasant position of anyone involved in the shooting ease. He took the mansion house and shootings for the season as a temporary arrangement while the negotiations for the transfer of the estate were proceeding, and brought servants from England. A month or two later Mr Monson—who became very popular among the permanent officials and servants on the estate —was joined by a Mr Windsor Cecil Dudley Hamborough, a lieutenant in the 3rd Battalion West York Regiment (militia), whose "guardian" or trustee he was understood to be under the testament of a relative of Hamborough, who had left that gentleman a quarter of million of money. This money Mr Hamborough. who was 20 years of age, was to inherit on his majority. Mr Hamborough's arrival gave a new phase to the negotiations for the purchase of the estate, the understanding come to being that the purchase was to be a joint arrangement between Mr Monson and him. So far had the negotiations gone in this direction that it is probable, but for the affair of the 10th inst, the title-deeds would have been signed before now. A small steam launch, the "Alert," was purchased, and Mr Hamborough engaged  
A YOUNG MAN NAMED EDWARD SCOTT  
as engineer. Scott is described as a very gentlemanly-looking Englishman, who came to Ardlamont on the 9th, was nearly all the time in the company of his employers, and was even privileged to dine with them. Beyond this, nothing is known about him at Ardlamont, and his sudden and inexplicable disappearance from the place within the past week has been one of the incidents which have set the police upon a new course of investigation.

On the morning of Thursday, the 10th inst, Mr Monson and Mr Hamborough went out before breakfast to a small planting, near Ardlamont House, to shoot rabbits, and they were accompanied by Scott, who was to carry any game that might be killed. Scott had no gun. The guns which the two gentlemen carried were of different bores—one being a 12-bore and the other a 20. One rabbit only had been shot, and, to Monson's story, he was passing through the wood towards the house, on the opposite side of the wood from Mr Hamborough when he heard a shot fired. He cried out asking his fnend what he had got, and receiving no answer went in the direction in which he had heard the discharge, and found his friend lying dead beside a small embankment. The exact situation is within twenty yards of the high road, and beside the road are the stables of Ardlamont House, the house itself being only a few yards further off. Monson carried  
HIS OWN GUN AND HIS FRIEND'S  
into the house and got and a gardner and some others to remove the body there. The factor on the estate—Mr Steven—was called and Dr M'Millan, Tignabruaich, was sent for. The doctor, on examining the body, found a gunshot wound of between two and three inches wide behind the right ear. The wound, as would naturally happen in the case of a discharge of small shot at close range was pulpy and well-defined, and the face was untouched. Mortification ensued very rapdly, and whenever the deputy Procurator-Fiscal (Mr M'Naughton) had made the necessary formal examination of the body it was coffined and sent to the Isle of Ventnor (*sic*), Isle of Wight, for interment. Mr Steven, the factor, acting upon the instructions of the deceased's father and mother, who were summoned to Ardlamont on Thursday night, accompanied the coffin to the Isle of Wight.

The examination by the Deputy-Fiscal gave no substantial cause for doubting that an accident had happened in the manner suggested, although it was considered rather curious that a horizontal wound at the back of the right ear should have been caused by the accidental discharge of the victim's gun, the position necessary before such an occurrence could take place being a very improbable one. The explanation offered was that Mr Hamborough had been walking along the top of a dyke, carrying his gun at full cock, and had fallen off the dyke, with the result that the gun was discharged.

All these facts were collected by Mr M'Naughton, the Deputy-Fiscal, who proceeded to Inverary on Monday to lay them before his chief previous to their being reported in the ordinary course to Crown counsel. The bald facts of the case were secured with difficulty by the local correspondents of the Glasgow newspapers, and several details which were altogether erroneous. The whole matter was then considered to be at end. Local sentiment, and  
LOCAL IMAGINATION,  
the latter always very strong agent among country communities where tragedies are rare, began, however, to invest the affair with sinister theories, and certain new facts transpired which gave wings to all sorts of rumours. In the first place, it was learned that Mr Hamborough instead of being a novice with the gun, as was first stated, was an expert marksman, who had been for years used to the handling of firearms. Then it transpired that within a few days previously he had narrowly escaped death twice—once by the discharge of his gun and once by a boating accident. To crown all, the Procurator-Fiscal appeared on the scene again prepared to make further investigation, and was surprised to find that Scott had disappeared, leaving no trace behind. He left Tignabruaich by the Columba on Saturday, 12th, giving his address to the police as the Central Hotel, Glasgow. At the Central Hotel no such person is known, and Mr Monson, the only one who could be expected to give a clue to Scott's whereabouts, professes himself absolutely ignorant of his antecedents or his present location. The guns at this stage evidently assumed a new interest for the police, for they were taken possession of and sent to Inverary, mainly, it is understood, because of  
A GRAVE STATEMENT  
by a gamekeeper on the estate as to the relative users of the two guns and the apparent bore of weapon which had inflicted the wound. Experiments with the two guns at various ranges have, we understand, been made. The climax came, however, with the new fact which only canme to light last week, that the deceased's life was insured for £20,000 indirectly in favour of Mr Monson. Mr Monson, who was naturally very much affected by the lamentable occurrence of the 1Oth has within the past few days had the unpleasantness of his position intensified, for it understood that he is practically under police surveillance.

The rumours were by now being descibed as "sinister":

INSURED FOR £10,000.  
SINISTER RUMOURS.

According to rumour pretty current in the Ardlamont district of Argyleshire, a new and startling development has taken place in regard to the fatal shooting accident which occurred there nearly three weeks ago. It may be recalled (*says the Glasgow Evening Citizen*) that the story was that on the 10th of the present month Mr Hambro, the young gentleman, who had just attained his majority, was out shooting rabbits. It was said he was not proficient in handling gun, and that while crossing a dyke his foot slipped and the gun went off, all the contents lodging in his head. No one, however, seems to have been beside the unfortunate lad at the time, and it is now whispered that the gunshot wound did not appear to be such as an accident could account for nor such as he could well have inflicted upon himself. Deceased is reported to have been insured in an American office for £10,000, and in view of the mysterious nature of his death the insurance company, it is said, has declined to pay up. Be that as it may, the Sheriff and a doctor and police official visited the scene of the occurrence on Saturday and it is reported that the body of the deceased gentleman is to be exhumed. It also appears that on the Tuesday prior to the accident Hambro had a narrow escape from drowning. He was out boating with two friends when the craft either sank through the plug coming out or capsized. While his companions could swim, he was unable to do so, but was picked up by a gentleman who was fishing in the neighbourhood—only, however, as it turned out, to meet with a still more violent death two days later.

And then — an arrest, and an interview by the press with one of the estate workers:

THE ARDLAMONT SHOOTING CASE.  
Sensational Developments.  
ARREST OF MR MONSON  
His Removal to Inveraray-  
Rumoured Arrest of Scott  
(*From Our Own Reporter.*) 

TIGNABRUAICH, Wednesday.—The excitement regarding the Ardlamont shooting case reached a climax this forenoon, when Mr Monson, the tenant of the estate, was arrested. Sheriff Shairp and the representatives of the criminal authorities for the county took an extraordinary number of precognitions yesterday, and the substance of these justified them in taking that important and grave step.

The arrest was made in the morning, but it was done very quietly. The news, however, leaked out, and it was believed the prisoner would be at once taken to Inverary, a crowd gathered on the pier before eleven o'clock to await the arrival of the Lord of the Isles.

At a quarter-past eleven on the pier were the Sheriff, the Chief Constable, the Fiscal, and the Fiscal-Depute. They at once went on board. Behind them came a little group of three men, and they hurriedly went through the crowd and made their way downstairs. The three wore plain clothes —Constables Ross and M'Lean, with the prisoner, Mr Monson, young man, dressed in a stylish navy blue suit, black felt hat, and black bow tie, who shunned the eyes turned upon him, and looked exceedingly embarrassed and haggard.

The Columba happened this morning to get left behind by the Inverary steamer through calling at Kirn, and she arrived about five minuter behind the other. Mr Monson's brother and Steven, the factor, were on board. The brother was thunderstruck on being informed by the local constable of what had taken place, and the steamer conveying his brother whom he had specially come to meet being but few hundred yards off.

The village here remains in a state of surprise at the turn events have taken, more especially as it is rumoured that Scott has been taken into custody by the London police.

Interviews on the Estate.  
(*From Our Own Reporter.*)
TIGHNABRUAICH, Wednesday Morning.  
Following up the inquiry of yesterday, as fully reported in the *News*, I have interviewed a number of the persons upon whose evidence the action of the police authorities to a large degree depends ; and I have driven out to that portion of the estate where the incident of the 10th occurred. The police are naturally reticent, partly because they think it injudicious to confide too much in the reporters, but mainly because they have very little beyond incomplete theories to work upon. Scott's disappearance is, they admit, greatly to be regretted. All that was done to keep track of him was to instruct the policeman at Tighnabruaich Pier to get his name and address as left the Columba, and though this was done, it was, as events have proved, a useless precaution. The most graphic and reliable account of the whole affair which I have yet got was from Mr Steven, the acting factor on the Ardlamont estate. Mr Steven, who is a young man from Cathcart, is an acute and business like gentleman, popular with all the tenantry and employes on the estate. Residing within few hundred yards of Ardlamont House, he naturally came into daily contact with all the parties involved in this affair, and his services were particularly in request after the sad occurrence of the 10th. It is but fair to Mr Steven to say that had he been aware of the fact that his interviewer was a member of the press he would probably have been less free with his story, for the police have discouraged too much publicity in the meantime. "Mr Monson," he said, in answer to inquiries, "was the first one who, in response to advertisement in the papers, came here, and was followed sometime after by Hambrough. The statement that the estate was sold them made by some of the newspapers is untrue ;  
TERMS HAD NOT BEEN COME TO.  
Mr Monson is a quiet, good-natured gentleman, and so was Mr Hambrough. They were both temperate men, indeed Mr Hambrough was almost a teetotaler. So far as I saw all the party lived very harmoniously and agreeably together. The first time I saw Scott he was along with Mr Hambrough and Mr Monson, and I took him for one the party. On the morning of the 10th, when the three went out shooting they took a circuitous route round the estate coming back through the planting to the house in order to get breakfast. They were within twenty or thirty yards of being out of the wood when the shot was heard. Mr Hambrough was on the right side of the wood going toward the house, and Scott and Mr Monson were the opposite side of the wood. Hamurough's left side was towards his friends, and he was shot in the right side. I was not near the wood at the time, but am certain I heard the shot fired. Shortly afterwards the gardener came to me and told me one of the gentlemen had shot himself in the planting. We took a cart and found that Monson and Scott had lifted the body from the ditch it is believed to have fallen into, and placed him on the bank above it.  
I DID NOT SEE ANY GUNS  
Mr Monson was said to have carried them into the house. The body was carried into the house, and M'Millan was sent for. Mr Monson was, naturally, in a terribly grieved condition. I went to Glasgow to order a coffin and make arrangements for the removal of the body to Ventnor, and when on my way back I was joined by the father and mother of the deceased, who were very much shocked at the sudden death of their son. My impression is that Mr Hambrough met his death in the way suggested, falling while his gun was full cock, and consequently receiving the shot in his head. He was, I believe, an expert with the gun ; at least all the men about here say so, and his father told me that he had since early youth been accustomed to handle firearms. I am afraid the Procurator Fiscal has been too hastily flying at  
RASH CONCLUSIONS  
in this matter. I speak from an intimate knowledge of all the facts and of all the parties. One thing, by the way, which seems to have passed unobserved that some of the scattered pellets from the fatal shot lodged in a tree beside which Mr Hambrough fell. The marks are plainly to be distinguished.

Where does Mr Monson come from?

I don't know ; I have heard that he comes from Yorkshire, but can't speak with any certainty. The arrangements for letting the place were made through our Edinburgh agents.

And Mr Hambrough. where does he come from?

He belonged to Yorkshire, but his family, so far as I can learn, is best known at Ventnor.

What about the insurance on the life of the deceased, said have been assigned to Mr Monson ?

Well, I have spoken to Mr Monson about that, and he has told me, and can prove, that the death of his friend means a considerable loss of money to him. I consider all the prevalent rumours as absurd."

One of the men the estate, speaking evidently the sentiments of his fellow workmen, expressed the utmost sympathy with Mr Monson in his troubles. At the same time he animadverted strongly upon the conduct of the shooting party (augmented since the accident) which has not lost a single day's sport on the hill since the sad event. I was anxious to see Monson and have an interview with him. but was informed that he was that moment away shooting. A somewhat  
FORMAL DINNER PARTY  
it is said, took place in the house on the evening on which the Depute-Procurator-Fiscal made his examination. It is hardly necessary to say that that gentleman did not avail himself of an invitation he got to be present. His examination was carried out under the most unpleasant conditions, for the usual dressings above the wound had slipped off, and besides the purely legal duties of Procurator-Fiscal. Mr M'Naugbton had to exercise those of another profession by putting lint dressings on the body himself. It is significant of the distressing effect the accident had upon both Mr Monson and Mr Scott that none of them could be prevailed upon to look at the body after it had been carried into the house.

Since Monday the estate officials have prevented any unauthorised person visiting that portion the estate in which the accident occurred, but for the time being I found the rule relaxed, and drove from Tighnabruaich to the edge of the wood where Mr Hambrough was shot. It is round a corner from the factor's house, and within sight of the mansion-house — the stables, indeed, as stated yesterday, being only a few yards from where Mr Hambrough's body was found. The wood is mere planting.” much longer than it is broad, and, as there little brush in it, and the trees are fairly wide apart, one can see right through it. Mr Hambrough's body when seen by the factor and workmen was on the extreme edge of the wood, beside a moss-covered or drystone dyke, or rather embankment, which dips a few feet into an adjoining field. Scott said they found Mr Hambrough in the field, and lifted him up on to the bank. As is the custom among Highlanders, the workmen on the estate have already piled a smail cairn of stones at the spot.

SCOTT'S DISAPPEARANCE  
was in no way covert, it should be understood. He told several people that as he would not be needed any longer for the "Alert" he would go. He was, according to his first plan, to go away at two o'clock in the afternoon, but as some further information was wanted from him, he remained for the Columba at 2.45. Mr Steven, the factor, drove him in his gig to Tighnabruaich Pier.

By this point, details of Mr Monson were becoming of interest:

THE ARDLAMONT MYSTERY.  
DECLARATION BY THE PRISONER.

Mr Monson made a declaration to-day before Sheriff Shairp at Inveraray. The examination was of course conducted in private; but, it is understood, that Mr Monson sticks substantially by his former account of the affair of the 10th inst.

MR HAMBROGH AND MR MONSON.

As erroneous statements have been put in currency as to the connection of the two principal parties in this lamentable tragedy, the following particulars, taken from an authoritative source, says the *N. B. Mail*, may be given :—

Windsor Dudley Cecil Hambrough was the eldest son of Dudley Albert Hambrough Esq., Steephill Castle, Isle of Wight He was born 1873, and would have attained his majority early next year. He was lieutenant in the 4th Battalion Prince of Wales' Own Yorkshire Regiment. Lieutenant Hambrough's father is a J.P. for Hants, and the patron of two livings, and resides principally at Houghton, Stookbridge.

Alfred John Monson is the third son of the late Rev. Thomas John Monson, rector of Kirby-under-Dale, Yorkshire, his mother being a daughter the fifth Viscount Galway. He was born in May, 1860, and is thus in his 34th year. Mr Monson is a member of the family which Viscount Oxenbridge, the Master of the Horse, is the head, his grandfather, the Hon. and Rev. Thomas Monson. rector of Bedale, having been a son of the second Baron Monson, and the granduncle of the present Peer.

ANOTHER INSURANCE PROPOSAL.

A Rothesay correspondent telegraphs:—It may be stated that Dr Lawson. Rothesay, received a communication on 25th July from the head office of the Royal Insurance Company, Liverpool, stating that Lieutenant Windsor Dudley Cecil Hambrough, who, it was said, was then residing in Rothesay, would call for medical examination with reference to insurance. The young gentleman, however, did not call. He was said to be 21 years of age and resided at Risely Hall, Ripley, Yorkshire.

NOTES AND INCIDENTS.

The case, to which the arrest has imparted a complexion which it did not seem to bear at first, seems, says the *Glasgow Herald*, more peculiar the more it is inquired into. For obvious reasons it would be injudicious at the present time publish all the circumstances connected with it. There has been a good deal of comment on the fact that Mr Hambrough was rescued from a perilous position not many hours before he lost his life by shooting. At dusk on the evening of the 9th instant he went out sea-fishing in a boat with Mr Monson at Ardlamont Point. The boat struck on a rock and filled with water. Hambrough could not swim, but his companion could do so, and he went ashore for aid, returning with another boat in which he took his ward to land. Both men arrived at Ardlamont House at two o'clock in the morning, drenched to the skin, and Hambrough in particular very much exhausted. In spite of this they were early astir, and were out shooting as early as six o'clock. As an explanation of the reason why they were so soon about, Mr Monson that his wife and family, who were residing with him at Ardlamont, had occasion to visit Glasgow that day, and that as he had to be up at any rate to see them off he thought might as well put in the morning rabbit shooting with his ward. An hour and half after they set out Mr Hambrough was lying dead, shot in the back of the head. The gardener and the joiner who are employed on the estate were summoned, and they carried the body into the mansion-house, where it was seen two hours afterwards by Dr Macmillan, from Tighnabruaich. He wrote a report on the case, stating that death had resulted from a gunshot wound, and gave it as his opinion that it might have been caused by Mr Hambrough getting over the wall where his body was found holding his gun incautiously in his hand. This report, it may be explained, was granted on the assumption that the young gentleman had been using a short 20-bore sporting gun. It was subsequently ascertained, however, that his gun was a long 12-bore. In reference to this, Mr Monson said that they had exchanged guns when they were out. They had really wished to test a new sporting powder, known as amberite, and finding that they had no cartridges that morning which would suit Hambrough's gun they effected the exchange. In view of the fact referred to, Dr Macmillan at once withdrew his report and certificate from the Procurator-Fiscal, and also from the officials of American Insurance Company who had insured Mr Hambrough's life before his death for £20,000. At the time of the tragedy young Hambrough was in his twenty-first year, and it is believed there was an uncompleted document in existence which had been written with the object assigning the policy to Mr Monson.

A SINISTER FACT.

In the hurry and bustle incidental to so sad a tragedy it is not strange that some minor matters should have escaped attention at the time. About six yards distant from the place where Hambrough's feet were there is a small tree growing, and a careful examination of the bark about the height of a man's head shows a number pellet marks. The young man's head was not disfigured by the scorching or burning of gunpowder. 

```

As word came out that the original examining doctor's report had been withdrawn, it was revelaed that Hambrough's body was to be exhumed. Scott's disappearance was also increasingly commented upon, and his description started to be circulated, even as there were rumpours of his arrest in London.

THE ARDLAMONT MYSTERY.  
ARREST OF MONSON.  
HIS WARD'S BODY TO BE EXHUMED.  
THE MISSING MAN SCOTT.  
RUMOURED ARREST IN LONDON.  
EXCITEMENT IN THE DISTRICT.

Yesterday morning Mr Alfred Henry Monson, the tenant of the Ardlamont estate, Argyllshire, was arrested in connection with the death of his ward, Windsor Dudley Cecil Hambrough, by shooting, on the 10th of this month, full particulars of which were given in yesterday's *Courier*. The arrest was effected very quietly at seven o'clock in the moi on the public road leading to Ardlamont House >y Chief Constable Eraser. When about five miles out from Tighnabruaich, and within two miles Ardlamont House, met driving in a pony trap with guest who was going awav the Glasgow and South-Western steamer Neptune for Prince's Pier, Greenock. Seated at the back of Mr Monson's machine was a police officer, Sergeant Ross, of Lochgilpheau, who been shadowing him since Monday night. When Captain Fraser met the party he intimated that he had some business with throwing the reins to his friend, told him to on and leave the horse and machine the village. Mr Monson, apparently thinking that the liiei Constable was going straight the house, off his own trap and jumped on Captain Fraser's trap, and was followed by Sergeant Ross. Having got his man safely on board, Captain Fraser then turned the horse's head towards Tighnabruaich, and was told that he might consider himself his prisoner for having caused the death his friend, Hambrough. Monson, although taken by surprise by the suddenness of his arrest, took the matter very coolly. The prisoner was conveyed the Royal Hotel at Tighnabruiach, the party being met by the road Sheriff and the Fiscals, who were going out to the scene of the fatality to make some further inquiries bofore leaving the neighbourhood. The prisoner was removed to Inveraray by the Lord of the Isles. Monson is yonngish-looking man. His age is 35. He is middle height and fair complexion, and has a cleanshaven face, sharp features, and a rather prominent nose, which is slightly twisted to one side. At Crarae Mr M'Laclilan, writer, Lochgilphead, joined the Lord of the Isles, and proceeded with the prisoner to Inveraray. Mr M'Lachlan is act the prisoner's defence. telegraphed him before leaving Tighnabruaich.

BODY TO EXHUMED.

In view of the developments in the case, the body of Hambrough, which was taken England for interment, is to be exhumed.

COULD THE INSURANCE POLICY BE ASSIGNED ?

As has been already stated, the deceased gentleman about ten days before his death effected insurance for £20,000 with the Mutual Life Assurance Society of New York. The policy, however, having to come from New York, had never reached him, and could not, therefoie, have beon assigned to any one, whatever the intention may have been. Regarding the alleged assignation of the insurance policy on Hambrough's life to Monson, our representative was yesterday told that Monson's own explanation of the matter that the police was in course of being assigned to him, but that the assignment was not the date of Hambrough's death.

THE NATURE OF THE EVIDENCE.

The evidence in possession of the authorities believed, so far, to be circumstantial. Special points which are being investigated are the probable elevation at which the gun went off, and the kind of shot with which was loaded. It is reported that some of the pellets lodged in the trunk of a tree near at hand about a man s height.

THE MISSING MAN SCOTT.

Edward Scott, the man who is wanted by the police, is 28 years of age, between 5 ft. 9 in. and 5 ft. 10 in. in height. He has a sallow complexion, small dark moustachios, steel grey eyes, and carries his head erect, but there is nothing peculiar ia his gait. At the time he was last seen he wore a dark blue cloth coat and waistcoat and dark grey trousers. It is understood that Monson has given information to the police to the effect that he has heard from Scott since lie left Tighnabruaich, and that he believes that he is at present in London. When Scott was leaving Tighnabruich on the evening of the Saturday when young Hambrough was shot the local policeman, Duncan M'Calman, in view of the fact that the inquiry had not been completed, with commendable official sagacity, advised him not to go away, but as he had not a warrant he could not, of course, detain him, and Scott accordingly went on board the boat.

THE BOATING ACCIDENT.

There has been lot of talk here during the past day or two about the boating and the shooting accident occurring on the some morning within such short time of each other, the accident on the loch happening half-past one, and the fatal shooting affair at half-past seven. The explanation given of that is that Mrs Monson and her family, three in number, required to go Glasgow by the early morning boat, and that the family had all to be up very early in consequence. He also got Hambrough up, and, when his wife and family had gone, the three men (Scott, it will be recollected, being with them) went out shooting. When the body was found the men got the gardener and joiner on the estate, and they, with young Lyon, the farmer's son, removed the remains into the mansion house.

THE DOCTOR'S STATEMENT.

Dr M'Millan, of Tighnabruaich, who examined Hambrough's body, granted a report in which he certified that death had resulted from gunshot wound, and it is further said that he led it be understood that he was perfectly satisfied that the death had been an accidental one. On that account the inquiry was the meantime stayed, only to be resumed on Thursday last more extended scale in consequence of rumoursi having got abroad that there had been foul play the matter. Monson's arrest is believed to have been made under instructions from the Crown Counsel. It is now stated that Dr M'Millan withdrew his first report and certified that the accident had not occurred in the way he had at first supposed.

MONSON BEFORE THE SHERIFF.

Monson was brought before Sheriff-Substitute yesterday afternoon for emitting declaration. On the motion, however, of his agent, Mr M'Lachlan, the examination was adjourned till this forenoon eleven o'clock, to admit the prisoner's Edinburgh agent, Mr Davidson Syme, Castle Street, being present.

ARREST OF SCOTT.

Mr Monson's brother, and Steven, the factor, arrived at Tignabruaich just after the Lord of the Isles had sailed for Inveraray with Mr Monson, a prisoner, on board. The brother was thunderstruck on being informed by the local constable of what had taken place, and the steamer conveying his brother, whom had specially come to meet, being but a few hundred yards off. The excitement in Tignabruaich was intensified yesterday by a rumour that Scott had been taken into custody the London police. 

```

Although now under arrest, it seems as if Monson was still enjoying the comforts of life, even as questions were being asked about the state of the insurance policies and the extent to which he may or may not have benefitted from them:

The Ardlamont Mystery

MONSON BEFORE THE SHERIFF

THE INSURANCE QUESTION.

SCOTT STILL AT LARGE.

Mr Alfred Monson was yesterday brought before Sheriff Shairp in the Courthouse, Inveraray, and judicially examined on the charge of causing the death of Mr Windsor Dudley Cecil Hamhrough, by shooting, at Ardlamont, on the 10th of the present month. After emitting his declaration, the accused was committed to prison for further examination. It is probable that he will brought up for his second examination after a lapse of eight days, and if he is then committed to prison he will be removed to Greenock, there to await his trial.

Accused in Prison.

Mr Monson is meantime living comfortably, if not luxuriously, at his own expense. His meals are brought into him from the George Hotel, which adjoins the Courthouse. On Wednesday he had a dinner of three courses. He had tea in the evening, and breakfast was carried to him before nine o'clock yesterday morning. In other respects he is being treated as an ordinary prisoner. He sleeps in his clothes on the raised wooden bed-shaped arrangement on the floor of the cell, with a couple of blankets thrown over him. He is said to be now feeling his position, it is believed, very keenly. While under police surveillance from Monday night till Wednesday morning his behaviour savoured something of bravado. On Tuesday he was out shooting on the moor in the company of some of his guests with a policeman walking on each side of him, and he drove about, dined, and slept constantly shadowed by representatives of the law, and never once did he show the least sign of annoyance or discomposure.

APPLICATION TO HOME SECRETARY.

The criminal authorities are preparing precognitions to be laid before Crown counsel. An application has been made to the Home Secretary for authority to exhume the remains of the young gentleman who is alleged have been murdered. Mr Hambrough's body was buried in the Isle of Wight in the family burial-ground there, and an official from Inveraray will go through to the Isle Wight to superintend the exhuming and examination the remains. From hints which have been dropped since Monson's arrest, it is believed that, if the case goes to trial at all, the evidence will be of a rather sensational nature. It is now stated that Monson was not Hambrough's legal guaidiau all, but only his tutor.

WARRANT TOR ARREST.

A warrant for the arrest the missing engineer, Edward Scott, was signed Wednesday night.

THE ACCUSED.

Alfred John Monson is the third son of the late Rev. Thomas John Monson, rector of Kirby-under-Dale. Yorkshire, his mother being the daughter of the fifth Viscount Galway. He was born in May, 1858, and is thus in his thirty-fourth year. Mr Monson is a member of the family of which Viscount Oxenbridge, the Master of the Horse, is the head, his grandfather, the Hon. and Rev. Thomas Monson, rector of Bedale, having been a son of the second Baron Monson, and the grand-uncle of the present peer.

THE DECEASED

Windsor Dudley Cecil Hambrough was thee eldest son of Dudley Albert Hambroug, Esq., of Steephill Castle, Isle of Wight. He was bron in 1873, and would have attained his majority early next year. He was a Lieutenant in the 4th Battalion Prince of Wales' Own Yorkshire Regiment. Lieutenant Hambrough's father is a J.P. for Hants and the patron of two livings, and resides principally at Houghton, Stockbridge.

THE TRUE STORY OF THE INSURANCE

From a thoroughly reliable source the Glasgow *Evening Citizen* has learned all about the insurance negotiations, concerning which no end of rumours have been in circulation. Mr Hambrough being desirous of insuring his life approached the Mutual Life Assurance Society, of New York, through their Glasgow office, and, after the usual preliminaries of examination and references, a policy or policies amounting to £20,000 were taken out. When the insurance was being effected it was understood by the representatives of the Company that the policy was to be assigned to Mr Monson, with whom, indeed, there were one or more interviews on the subject. The question naturally arises, why should Mr Hambrough ASSIGN THE POLICY TO HIS FRIEND Mr Monson? The explanation seems a reasonable one. Mr Hambrough was desirous of purchasing the Ardlamont estate, and required money for this purpose. Although having the prospect of great wealth when he came of age, Mr Hambrough was not, in the meantime, in the possession of much money, and, as it was, was indebted to his friend Monson. The latter gentleman himself is reported not to be rich, but his wife is stated to be wealthy. Indeed, it is said that the intention first was to assign the policy to this lady and her children as the advances for the acquiring of the estate to be made out of her money. As events turned out,
THE POLICY NEVER WAS ASSIGNED.

And for the best of all reasons — it had not been received from the head office in New York, and, of course, no transfer could take place without the principal document. Mr Hambrough had merely received a receipt or covering note pending the arrival of the policy. This, then, leads directly the conclusion that Mr Monson can derive no pecuniary benefit from the death of Mr Hambrough. Whatever may have been the intentions of the contracting parties, there has been no assignation whatever of the policy, and whoever the Mutual Life Aseurance Society of New York pay the £20,000 to it will certainly not be Mr Monson, but the relatives of the deceased gentleman.

```

Once the order for the exhumation was approved by the Home Secretary, little time was wasted in carrying it out. And as the news story developed, we can only imagine how gripped people were to hear the next installment, and the extent to which they were forming their own opinions about whether the death was an accident, or something more sinister, with the tragic incident that alerted me to this story in the first place, in what is now *The Ferryman* pub in Lymington:

THE SCOTCH SHOOTING CASE

EXHUMATION OF LIEUT. HAMBROUGH'S BODY.  

OPINION AS TO THE WOUNDS.

HIS INSURANCE POLICIES.

A Ventnor correspondent, telegraphing last night, says: —The body if Lietenant Windsor Cecil Dudley was exhumed this afternoon Ventnor, in the presence of an immense crowd of spectators. Early in the day communication had been received by the Rev. J. Hall Smith, Vicar of St. Catherine's, the Mother Church, from the Lord Advocate, to the effect that the application to tha Home Secretary for order to exhume the body had been successful, and that the gentlemen having the matter in hand behalf the Government would arrive at Ventnor at three o'clock in the afternoon with full power to remove the body. The deceased, like his father, was well known at Ventnor, and when Major arrived the London train shortly before four o'clock, met with many expressions of sympathy. It is stated that he was at the Home Office on Sunday from eleven till seven o'clock with his legal advisers. In an interview this afternoon Major Hambrough, while remarking that he was unable to make any statement at the present time, being in a sense in the hands of the police, said that it was fact that two policies had been effected on his son's life  
EACH FOR TEN THOUSAND POUNDS  
and that a few daya before the death of his son they were both assigned to Mrs. Monson, not to the prisoner. There came over by the train already mentioned Mr. J. C. MacCulloch, of Inverary, Procurator Fiscal. Mr. MacNaughten, Deputy-Procurator Fiscal of Argyleshire, also arrived, accompanied by Dr. Littlejohn, of Edinburgh, and Dr. McMillan, who first examined the deceased. Dr. Sanders, of Edinburgh, came the same train to be present at the examination on behalf of the prisoner Monson. They drove to the Royal Marine Hotel. A messenger was immediately sent for the vicar, who proceeded to the hotel and signed the order of the Secretary of State placing the churchyard at the disposal of the Procurator Fiscal and his party. The opening of the grave was immediately proceeded with in the presence of Mr. MacNaughten and the Deputy Chief Constable Gibson, who, with a staff of police, kept the public outside the graveyard. It was intended to examine the body in the mortuary, but this was found to be too confined for such an operation, and it was taken out again and placed upon a bier in the cemetery yard. Removed from the case in which it was enclosed within the oak coffin, it was examined in the open and identified.

Immediately the lead inside coffin was opened the body was identified by one or two who knew Lieutenant Hambrough quite well. The body was greatly decomposed. The examination lasted over two hours, and was not completed before darkness set in. Photographs of wounds in the head of the deceased were taken in several aspects. Photograpbs were also obtained of internal sections of the scull. Major Hambrough was present at the cemetery, and watched the proceedings from a distance.  
HE WAS DEEPLY AGITATED.  
After the examination the body was again placed in the coffins, which were sealed and screwed down. The re-interment, which took place about ten o'clock, was unaccompanied by any ceremony. The legal and medical officials conducting the investigation were extremely reticent as to the result of the post-mortem, but sufficient was permitted to leak out to favour the conviction that the wound was not self-inflicted. Several pellets were found in the head, and it was demonstrated that the shots entered the head from the back and passed out behind the ear, a portion of which was carried away. All the medical gentlemen were, it is understood, perfectly satisfied that there was singeing of the hair or skin around the wound, which leads to the belief that the instrument of death could not have been in the hands of the unfortunate young gentleman. The body was formally identified on the coffins being opened by Dr. McMillan and Mr. MacNaughten. Major Hambrough was not asked to perform this painful duty. The gentleman who accompanied Mr. Monson on the occasion of the funeral waa not the the missing Mr. Scott, but Mr. Stevens, the factor of the Ardlamont Estate.

The Hambrough family trace their descent back to 1670.  Steephill Castle is erected on the sight of a rustic thatched villa, built about 1700 by the Right Hon. Hans Stanley, when Governor of the island, and a later period inhabited by an Earl of Dysart. The structure was commenced by J. Hambrough in 1833, and completed in two years. It was designed by Sanderson, the architext of the Ryde Town-hall. The mansion, situated about half a mile from Ventnor, is an imitation of the baronial castles of the reign of Stephen. In the grounds, some seventy or eighty acres in extent, there is an historic well dedicated to St. Lawrence, and a short distance further on the village of St. Lawrence, the parish of which consists of a strip of land extending about a mile and a half along the seashore. A few years ago the estate was in the books of a Piccadilly agent, the upset price being £30,000.

The question arises  
WHETHER ANYONE WITNESSED THE FATALITY.  
The prisoner states that he and Scott were amongst the trees of larger growth, out of sight, the one carrying the 20-bore gun and the other a few rabbits. They heard a shot fired, and rushing forward to see what success had attended the shot, they found Mr. Hambrough lying dead. But a third person heard the shot, a gentleman who occupied the neighbouring schoolhouse for the month. The next thing he heard was that a fatality had occurred. He has been interviewed by the authorities, since which he has gone home, and the house again tenanted by the schoolmistress. Mr. Monson regards this stranger a witness in his favour, and his address is retained. With regard to Mr. Scott, Mr. Monson only knew him for a few hours. The prisoner asserts this himself.

THE TREND OF THE EVIDENCE.  
WHAT THE PHOTOGRAPHS WILL PROVE.

The Press Association's Ventnor correspondent, telegraphing this morning, states that Professor Littlejohn's testimony regarding the death of Lieut. Hambrough will be altogether opposed to the theory that he lost his life through an accident. In addition to the absence of singeing of the hair, it is regarded as a significant fact that no wadding from the cartridge was found in the head, photographs of which have been taken in six different positions. The party which attended the exhumation left Ventnor this morning for Glasgow, and will proceed thence to Inverary, to attend the hearing of the charge against Monson, which will be resumed on Friday next. 

EXPLAINING THE ARDLAMONT MYSTERY.

TRAGIC SHOOTTNG ACCIDENT.

The Press Association's Lymington correspondent telegraphs.— A tragically shocking affair occurred this morning at Wallhampton. Henry Card, a gamekeeper in the employ of Mr. J. W. Heseltine was talking with the landlord of the local public house, when the conversation turned upon the Ardlamont shooting mystery. Card insisted that it was possible that Mr. Hamborough's injuries were self-inflicted, and in order to demonstrate this he took up his gun, placed it behind his back with one hand, and reaching down the other hand, pulled the trigger. The gun happened to be loaded, and Card blew the top of his skull off. He is not dead yet, but the doctors state that it will be impossible for him to recover.

TRAGIC AFFAIR AT LYMINGTON.

Our Lymington correspondent writes:— A shocking affair occurred at the Wagon and Horses Inn, Walhampton, on Tuesday. A man named Henry Card, employed as gamekeeper at Walhampton Park, entered the taproom and ordered pint of beer. He was served, and whilst drinking it a conversation took place amongst the company present as to the probability of Lieut. Hambrough's gunshot wound in the neck having been self-inflicted. A man said be was sure it was not, a statement Card contradicted, adding that he could easily demonstrate how it could be done. Handing his double-barrelled gun to one of the company, he said, "You try; it's empty." The man declined, and Card then took the gun, placed it behind his back, and tried in two or three different ways to get the muzzle against his neck. To the astonishment of all present, the gun suddenly exploded, the charge blowing off the top of Card's head, leaving the brain protruding. Drs. Rendall and Hill were speedily in attendance, but there was no hope from the first, and Card died within two hours. He was 38 years of age, and leavea wife and nine children unprovided for. The tragic affair caused quite a consternation in the town.

The inquest was held on Thursday afternoon the Wagon and Horses Inn, Walhampton, before Mr. Bernard Harfield, county coroner. The evidence was to the following effect:— Dr. Rendall deposed that was called in immediately after the accident and found the deceased lying insensible on the floor of the inn, his face downwards, surrounded by pools of blood and scattered brains. On examining the head be found an irregular lacerated wound, about two inches in diameter, situated on the upper part of the back of the head, rather inclined to the right side. From this brain matter was exuding and hemorrrhage occurring. He did all he could, but Card eventually became comatosed and died two hours after receiving the injury. The wound was a gunshot wound. The man's condition was hopeless from the first. —James Geary, living near, deposed to seeing the deceased just before he entered the public-house. Card had then opened his gun, apparently for the purpose of drawing the cartridges, but just at that time their attention was attracted to a crowd of persons crossing the railway bridge, and witness could not say whether deceased actually did remove the cartridges.— John Bligh, friend of the landlord of the Wagon and Horses, deposed to Card coming in and having pint of beer. A discussion took place relative to the Scotch shooting case, when deceased denied that it was impossible for Lieut. Hambrough's wound have been self-inflicted. He asked Bligh to take up his gun and try, saying it was empty. Bligh not caring to do so, Card seized the gun, cocked the hammer, and after some difficulty in getting it in position behind his back, pulled trigger and exploded one barrel with fatal effect.— Other evidence was given, all showing that Card had been fully under the belief that his gun was empty.— A verdict of "Accidental death" was returned.

SHOCKING GUN ACCIDENT NEAR LYMINGTON. INQUEST AT WALHAMPTON.

The County Coroner (Mr. B. Harfield) held an inquest on Thursday afternoon, at the Waggon and Horses, Walhampton, in connection with a tragic calamity that took place there at mid-day Tuesday, when Henry Card, aged 31, of Snook's Farm, a gamekeeper in the employ of Mr. J. P. Heseltioe, shot himself whilst attempting to show how Lieut. Hantheough might have done so. On assembling the jury inspected the low-roofed tap-room in which the tragedy occurred, the ceiling of which showed a cluster of shot-marks, and some hair where the charge had scattered after striking the deceased. From the inn they proceeded to deceased's home, a secluded country homestead, about a mile off, to view the body. The inquest commenced sitting at quarter-past four, first witness called being Dr. Rendell, who deposed that he was on that side of the water about ten minutes to twelve, and was asked to go to the Waggon and Horses. On his arrival he entered the tap-room, and found the deceased lying INSENSIBLE ON THE FLOOR, lying on his left side with his face downwards. and surrounded by pools of blood and scattered brains. An examination of his head showed an irregular lacerated wound about two inches in diameter, situated at the upper part of the back of the head, rather inclined to the right side, from which brain matter was exuding and hemorrhage occurring. He did all he could for him by endeavouring to atop the haemorrhage by pressure, but he gradually became more insensible and eventually comatosed, and died about two hours afterwards ; he had no other marks of injury observable. In his opinion the wound was a gunshot one. He considered the case hopeless from the first.

James Geary, of Waterman's Farm, stated that at about 11 o'clock on Tuesday morning, whilst he was working in the field the deceased spoke to him. They had a little conversation about his birds, when the deceased looked to the railway line and said " What a lot people going down the line; I wonder what's up." At the same time he unlocked his gun, a breechloader, apparently, as I thought, to take the cartridges out, but, drawing my attention to the people going down the line, I did not take notice whether he took the cartridges out or not. A few minutes afterwards, deceased left him and went across the field in the direction the Lymington ferry. He noticed nothing unusual in his manner.

John Bligh, of London, staying at the Waggon and Horses, was told at about half past eleven that Mr. Card was in the house and he wanted a pint of beer, with which he supplied him ; another customer had a pint of beer, and after drawing that and a pint for himself he went into the tap-room and asked Mr. Card to drink. He said to deceased " I see they have had rather a scene across in the Island, or at Ventnor." He said " Is that that gentleman that was shot in Scotland?" Witness fetched the paper, and read the article to him, some gentleman sitting in the room said that the old keeper in Scotland said it was impossible for Lieut. Hambrough to have shot himself as he was shot, Card replied "OH YES HE COULD DO SO."

He invited witness to try, saying "There is my gun, you can try it, it is empty." Witness was sitting on a seat, and didn't offer to get up. Card was nursing a little white dog at the time ; he instantly put the dog down, and took the gun up and cocked it. He then took it in his right hand, put it behind his back, with the muzzle towards the back of his head, and then fired. Witness iilustrated his explanation with the aid of the gun in question. He
SAW DECEASED PRESS THE TRIGGER,
and when the deed was done he put the gun down on to the table, and gradually sank down. The other hammer was at full cock. Witness called Mr. Gosling, the landlord, and asked where he could get a doctor, and was told across in the town, he called out to the ferryman to get his boat ready as quick as he could. He went into the town and summoned a doctor. When witness returned a doctor had arrived. Witness considered the shooting the result of an accident. Deceased seemed in his usual spirits. When deceased came into the tap-room, on putting down his gun, he stated to a boy that it was not loaded. Fitz Inman, of Wolverhamptan, knew the deceased well, and identified him after death. On Tuesday morning between half-past eleven and twelve witness was at the Waggon and Horses when Mr. Card came in. He was not in the tap-room at the time of the occurrence, being then on his way home to get a paper. He heard the report of a gun when he reached his door, and it appeared to come from the inn. He was called back to the house by the landlord. On opening the tap-room door he found deceased with his head resting on the settle. Witness took hold of him and eased him on to the floor. Witness took the pipe deceased was smoking out of his mouth. When witness left the room the gun was lying on the settle, he did not notice where it was on his return. He did not hear deceased say the gun was not loaded ; deceased was A VERY CAREFUL MAN with guns. The gun used was not deceased's but had been used by him for some weeks. The only other man the room when witness left was Mr. Bligh, though he believed a man named Etheridge entered the room just after he felt. It was not considered necessary to call Etheridge, as he could not add materially to Mr. Bligh's statement. The Coroner summed up briefly, and the jury returned a verdict of ACCIDENTAL DEATH. The deceased leaves a wife and nine young children.

THE ARDLAMONT MYSTERY

EXCITEMENT AT VENTNOR, EXHUMATION OF LIEUTENANT HAMBROUGH'S REMAINS.

MR. MONSON COMMITTED FOR TRIAL

HEAVY INSURANCE POLICIES.

Public interest has during this week been keenly aroused in what has become widely known as the Ardlamont mystery, and when it was ascertained that an application had been made to the Home Secretary for permission to exhume the body of Lieut. Hamborough, the keenest excitement was exhibitied throughout the Island. Events have followed each other rapidly, and having despatched a special representative to Ventnor, we are able to give the fullest details of the proceedings.

INTERVIEW WITH THE VICAR.

In the course of an interview the Vicar (the Rev. Mr. Shaw) told our reporter that he was much upset about the affair. It was the first of the kind he had ever been mixed up in. The certificate of death was brought to him by Mr. Monson and Mr Houston, the clerk of Ventnor Local Board, and who was for a long time agent to the estate. He saw them in his study, and they handed in a certificate signed by "Alexander Stewart, of Kilpinan," but it did not state any cause of death, that not being required. The Vicar enquired as to the accident and Mr. Monson, who appeared deeply affected, answered. He was, said the Vicar, a very good looking young gentleman, but at the time he was not aware of his identity: but gathered from his remarks that he was the undertaker. Indeed he was very much impressed with the fact, because at the funeral Mr Monson was moved to tears, which led the Vicar to mentally remark "This is the first time I have seen an undertaker cry." The explanation given to him of the accident was that the deceased stepped on some furze which concealed a hidden drain, and this led the Vicar to preach the funeral sermon on the Sundary evening following, from the words "There is but a step between me and death "; that in the morninng being "Jesus wept." Every effort was made by Mr. Manson to get the body interred in the family vault, but there is a strong feeling in Ventnor against disturbing the bodies in vaults beneath the church; therefore the Vicar declined to act unless under an order from the Home Office, which did not arrive in time.

![](hambrough-hampshire-independent-9-9-93.png)

During the week there have been numbers of visitors at the churchyard to view the grave of the deceased. It is almost opposite the front of the beautiful church his grandfather erected, and is covered with beautiful flower and plants. The stone is a handsome one, surmounted by a rustic cross, and beneath is the inscription to the aunt who died in May, 1870, and about whom there is curious family story. the family vault is beneath the church ; but in the building is a very handsome memorial tablet in white marble. The inscription runs—

"In memory of JOHN HAMBROUGH, Esq., of Steephill Castle, in the Isle of Wight, who departed this life on 4th February, 1863, aged 69 years. Also of SOPHIA HAMBROUGH, daughter of George Townsend, Esq., and Lady Elisabeth Townsend, of Honingtee Hall, Warwickshire, wife of the above, who departed this life the 16th February, 1863. seed 70. 'Our light affliction, which is but a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory.'"

AN HISTORIC FAMILY.

The Hambrough family trace their descent back to 1670. Steephill Castle is erected on the site of a rustic thatched villa, built aroiund 1700 by the Right Hon. Hans Stanley when governor of the Island, and at a later period inhabited by an Earl of Dysart. The structure was commenced by J. Hambrough in 1833, and completed in two years. It was designed by Sanderson, the architect of the Ryde Town Hall. The mansion, situated about half a mile from Ventnor, is an imitation of the baronial castles of the reign of Stephen. In the grounds, some seventy or eighty acres in extent, there is an historic well dedicated to St. Lawrence, and a short distance further on is the village of St. Lawrence, the parish of which consists of a strip of land extending about a mile and a half along the seashore. A few years ago the estate was in the books of a Piccadilly agent, the upset price being £30,000.

THE EXHUMATION.

Scotch officials, accompanied by medical expert., arrived at Ventnor, by the 3.30 ',Rent.n train on Monday. They at once Move t the Royal Marine Hotel, where they were met by the Rev. Hall Shaw, the vicar of the parish. The Home Secretary's order was produced mid countersigned by the vicar, and the keys of the churchard were then handed to the Scotch authorities. They were—Mr. J. Maclullich, Procurator Fiscal, Inverary ; Mr. MeNaughton, Deputy Procurator Fiscal ; lie. Littlejohn, at Edinburgh, for the Crown ; Dr. McMillian. Mils fire examined the body and in. Sandscs, M.II , On behalf of the primmer Monroe. Mr. Mediaughton was interviewed by our reporter immediately on his arrival, and stated that the orders they had received to carry out were very altar, and, whilst the Press should have every information, it was desired to keep the churchyard perfectly clear dial., the operation, which would be proceeded with at once. At twenty minutes to five the gravediggers commenced their work, the Deputy Chief Constable and Mr. MeNaughthn being paces Crowds id perms. lined the churchyard well•, and the proceedings ' appeared to arouse a great amount of interest.

In any ca., the assignment would be invalid, owing toLieutenantHanabrough being minor. The in.ranoe a...lollies have intimated their willtugnoss to tray over the money as as the peewits legally entitled to it hare been weer. mined. Some little time ago Major Hambrough wrote to the prisoner asking him for the whereabouts of his son. To this communication Monson curtly replied. -Sir.-I am not ann'a keeper. bat I believe be is at Riseley Hall." Thin letter will be predated at tbs trial. M. MOiSON COMMITTED FOR TRIAL. Mr. McTullis+, the Procurator-Fiscal, and his assistant, Mr. McNaughton, arrived from Ventnor at Inverary on Wednesday. Dr. McMillan, of Tichnabruich, who wan the heat medical to me the body at Mr. Hamboruugh, also Ventnor, where he had taken part in the post-mortem examination, and landed at Tichnabruich, settee he resides... They de:shoed to state the result of their visit to the south, but it was underotond to be unfavourable to Mr. Monson. At any rate, Mr. Monson was that afternoon committed for trial oo the charge of murder, and was subsequently removed from Inverary to !Greenock. the date of rem the trial is uncertain. Mr. Monson has all along declined to make any statement. In this lie acts upon the advice of hi. counsel, although at the same time he maintains his entire innocence according to Scotch law, nothing the case is allowed to officially transpire. One fact which has come out very prominently is that Mr. Monson all along been in pecuniary difficulties, although he boasted that there was great wealth at the disposal of himself and Mr. Hambrough. Nothing was ever hinted of his having been adjudged • bank• ' rupt. He produced such ao impression wealth that !there was much competitton for the custom of Ardis:- las:tot House. The story put forth that Mr. Hambrough was to have earned to a quarter of a million it now re; garded a. entirely abautd It is also said that a number of pawnockets were taken possession of by the authorities when they searched Ardlamont Haase. 

ARTISTS AT ARDLAMONT.

Artists are daily arriving at Ardlamont to take sketches of the spot where Mr. Hambrough's dead body was found, but they are not allowed to get near it. Policemen, by order of the Sheriff, guard the place night and day. the authorities being desirous to keep everything intact, particularly a small rows. tree at the foot of which Mr. Ilambrough fell they I my that the twigs are ploughed.. d by the leaden " pellet. front a gun. The watch is to be maintained until the tree and its surroundings have been photographed from every point of view. Neither are sketches of Ardlamont House allowed to be taken, though why not does not appear. tin Wednesday the clamorsa which surround.' the mansion repeatedly broken by the firing of guns; two tithe goads the late Mr. Hambrough, who have remained in the house since his untimely death, were enjoying themselves shooting game in the woods to the west. Not gun has beets fired in the woods to the east, as it is there Mr. Hatobrough met his death. It is curious fact that Mr. Monson wished to insure Mr. Harnbrough's life in the London, Liverpool, and Globe for £50,000, but they declined there was no insurable interest. lle then succeeded in inswing Sr. Hansbrough's life in two sums of Zio,oon each in another office, but he did not disclose the fact that the London, Liverpool, and Globe had declined to Mute • policy, though that is one of the conditions of all insurancos. Another element for enquiry is added to theme. Who took the body to Veatnor is Some of tboae consulted on the point say it Mr. Scott, tboueh they did not enquire aa to his Others think it wu a fourth person. Mr. Stevens, bet be arrived with Mr. Monson. This point is great importance. and will have to be sifted b► dos authorities. It a stated that a warrant has been issued for the arrest of Mr. Scott for whom the police are prosecuting a vigilant search. There was a report in London on Wednesday night that Scott is is hiding there. He is said not to be so engineer at all, but a man about town, and to be well known in a certain fashionable West End bar. He is said to have been lees by several of his companions since the tragedy in Scotland. 

TO DO ABOVE 

REMOVAL OF MR. MONSON.

A special reporter telegraphing from Inverary on Friday, says:— I am assured by a legal gentleman, who has seen the documents, that the assignments of Mr. Hambrough's life policies to Mrs. Monson were out and out assignments, and not merely in the nature of securities. The question of the validity of such assignments does not arise, so long it can be proved that Mr. Monson, with his non-legal mind, thought they were valid. I am told, too, on semiofficial authority, that Mr. McNaughton, the Deputy-Fiscal, upon returning from inspecting the body the day after the tragedy, expressed confidently the opinion that the dead man had not shot himself either accidentally or intentionally. His suspicion of Mr. Monson may of itself account for the shadowing of Mr. Monson for some time before his arrest, but it renders more inexplicable the mistake of Dr Macmillan in giving the report which he subsequently withdrew.

Mr. Monson, handcuffed to a policeman in plain clothes, left Inverary yesterday on the steamer Lord of the Isles. Monson was taken quielty to the vessel 15 minutes before she was timed to start, passing round the back of the town, so to create as little attention as possible. Monson, on boarding the steamer, was immediately placed in the captain's cabin.

One report of the exhumation of the body also described Monson's visit to the Island on Monday, August 21st, when he brought Hambrough's body back to the Island:

THE SCOTCH MYSTERY. EXHUMATION OF LIEUTENANT HAMBROUGH'S BODY.

All arrangements having been completed, the exhumation of the body of Lieutenant Hambrough takes place this afternoon at Ventuor. The grave is in a churchyard which has for some time been disused, except for those having family vaults. It is in the centre busy street, and though the strictest privacy is to observed, the coffin will necessarily be exposed to the public view. For examination it will be removed to the mortuary, where it remained when brought from Scotland.

Mr. Monson when at Ventor was accompanied by person who gave the name of Stevens. They occupied rooms at the Royal Marine Hotel, and an official there states that soon after dinner on the first evening of their stay—Monday, August 21. —Mr. Monson seemed very depressed, and was very unwell, in consequence, he said, of worry through the sad accident, and of having entertained a large party at his castle in Scotland. So bad, indeed, did become that it was found necessary to send for a local doctor, who prescribed for him, and next day was much better. On the Tuesday evening he left the hotel, and proceeded to the station, where he met Lieutenant Hambrough's father, and escorted him to the hotel, where they both remained until after the funeral on Wednesday, when Mr. Monson discharged the account, and they left together. Yesterday a large number of people entered the churchyard look at the grave. Though Mr. Monson visited the vicar at the time of the funeral, that gentleman was unaware of his identity, but believed him to be the Scotch undertaker. Mr. Monson described how the accident was supposed to have happened, his account exactly corresponding with that published. At the graveside the vicar noticed that Mr. Monson was greatly affected, which, to use his own words, surprised him, for he had never seen undertaker weep at a funeral before. Mr. Monson's statement led the vicar to take as his text the following Sunday evening "There is but step between me and death," and in his discourse made special reference to the occurrence, describing it as had been spoken of to him.

The body was brought to Ventnor in charge of a gentleman believed to be the missing Mr. Scott. When asked how the accident occurred, this gentleman said, " I was out with the party, but no one really knows how it happened." Mr. Scott remained till after the funeral.

Mrs. Monson, the wife of the prisoner, is a youngish lady of prepossessing appearance, and is the daughter of Mr. Fisher, a large and well-known colliery proprietor in the Barnsley district of Yorkshire. The publication of the fact in the newspapers that Scott is wanted has resulted in the officials at Inverary being literally deluged with telegrams regarding the movements of men bearing a similar name. None of them, however, referred to the proper person. The authorities are still vigorously prosecuting the search for him.

To skip to the end, a summary of what followed is provided in the introduction to a report of the court proceedings, published as part of a series of notable Scottish trials, in 1908:

In *Trial of A.J. Monson*, ed. John W. More, 1908, [pp.1-8](https://archive.org/details/trialofajmonson00mons):

INTRODUCTION.

The trial of Alfred John Monson on the double charge of attempting to murder and of murdering Windsor Dudley Cecil Hambrough at Ardlamont, Argyllshire, may be placed in the list of Scottish trials as the most important which has taken place since that of Madeleine Smith, nearly fifty years ago ; and, as in the case of that trial, the most abiding interest to students of criminology lies in the fact that the verdict was that anomalous and peculiarly Scottish one of " not proven," and that the mystery which was seen to enfold the case from the first was not dispelled by any definite pronouncement by the jury. Not only was the charge against the prisoner the most serious which any man has to face at the hands of his fellow-men, but also the circumstances of the alleged crime, the place where it occurred, and the social position of the accused and of his alleged victim were of such a kind as at once to arrest attention and to make people look with interested eyes to the High Court of Justiciary in Edinburgh, where, on 12th December, 1893, the prosecution and the defence began their efforts, extending over ten long days, to get at the heart of the mystery. But as day by day the evidence unfolded itself, and as the rival theories upon which the Crown and the defence were staking their respective cases came to be apparent, the interest became deepened until, throughout the length and breadth of the country, men were busy with the solution of the problems of the case which soon came to be known, and has continued to be known, as " The Ardlamont Mystery."

Round the question of how the boy Cecil Hambrough came by death was woven, as the trial proceeded, a web of evidence the like of which, in complexity and in diversity, has been surpassed in no criminal trial in Scotland. In the attempt by the Crown to show to the satisfaction of the jury that the accused man was guilty as libelled, and in the attempt to refute this contention, the counsel on either side brought forward the evidence of diverse and dissimilar witnesses, from the unlettered testimony of ploughmen, grooms, domestic servants, and game-keepers, to the expert evidence of surveyors, gunmakers, and medical men of great experience and high standing. The motive which the Crown sought to prove in order to strengthen their contention was the accused man's belief that by the death of Cecil Hambrough he would be financially a gainer to a considerable extent, and for the proving and disproving of this element of the case a tangle of financial enterprises in which the prisoner had been engaged for several years had to be unravelled by the evidence of actuaries, insurance officials, and financial men of many and varied hues. The case was further complicated by the evidence relating to the identity and disappearance of Scott, the alleged accomplice of the prisoner, that enigmatic figure which flitted across the stage at the most critical moment of the drama, coming from where no man knows and disappearing beyond the ken of men.

Although undoubtedly, of all the evidence which was led during the trial, that which dealt most intimately with the young man's death is, from a sensational point of view, of most clamant interest, yet there are many eddies and backwashes of the stream of evidence which are well worthy the attention of those who have the taste for studying the minutiae of a great trial ; and, looking at the case from a purely technical point of view, it is important on account of the legal points which came up for decision and which form an appendix to this report.

The uncontroversial facts of the case revealed during the progress of the trial are briefly these. In 1890 Mr. Monson was introduced to Major Hambrough, the father of Cecil Hambrough, by Mr. Tottenham, a London financier, and at Major Hambrough's request Mr. Monson undertook the custody and tuition of the boy Cecil, then seventeen years of age, till he should pass into the army, and for his services Mr. Monson was to be paid at the rate of £300 a year. At this time Major Hambrough was in a state of financial difficulty, and had mortgaged his life interest in certain family estates to an insurance company which had foreclosed, that is, had made itself owner of the interests mortgaged. Soon after taking up his duties as tutor to the boy Mr. Monson entered into negotiations with Major Hambrough with a view to relieving the Major's embarrassment, and these negotiations went on for some time. In 1892, however, for some reason a rupture occurred in the relations between Mr. Monson and the Major, who, from this time onward, used all his influence to induce his son to leave his tutor's house. In this he was unsuccessful, and Cecil continued to stay with Mr. Monson, most of his time being spent at a place in Yorkshire, where Monson was then residing.

In August, 1892, Mr. Monson was adjudicated bankrupt. In January, 1893, negotiations were entered into by him and Cecil with a view of raising money on the boy's expectancy in the Hambrough estates, but in February these broke down. Shortly after this Mr. Monson began to communicate with a firm of shooting agents in London in order to obtain the lease of a shooting in Scotland for the season, and in May a lease of Ardlamont House and shootings, in Argyllshire, was entered into in the names of Cecil Hambrough and Mr. Jerninghani, a gentleman whom Mr. Monson represented as being Cecil's guardian and good for the rent. The rent was £450 for the season, half to be paid by 1st August, under the condition that if it were not paid within a certain number of days thereafter the lease was to be void. Mr. Monson with his family went north to Ardlamont, and Cecil Hambrough joined them after finishing his training with the Yorks Militia, in which he held the rank of lieutenant. At this period and for some time before Mr. Monson and Cecil were being financed by Mr. Tottenham. In July Mr. Monson commenced to negotiate with Messrs. J. & F. Anderson, W.S., Edinburgh, agents for the proprietor of Ardlamont, for the purchase of the estate by Cecil Hambrough, but the price offered by Monson on behalf of Cecil was so inadequate that the agents would not consider it and the negotiations came to nothing. At the same time attempts were being made to effect an insurance over the life of Cecil Hambrough, and, after proposals to several insurance companies had been refused, owing to difficulties as to the insurable interest of those proposing the insurance, a proposal by Cecil Hambrough for insurance on his own life for £20,000, divided into two policies of £10,000 each, was accepted by the Mutual Life Assurance Company of New York, and the first premium, amounting to £194, was paid by Monson out of a cheque sent for another purpose by Tottenham. The policies were dated 4th August, and on 7th August Cecil Hambrough wrote to the manager of the Mutual Assurance Company, asking him to deliver them to Mr. or Mrs. Monson and saying that he had assigned them to Mrs. Monson for proper consideration and that she would be the person to whom the insurance money would be payable in the event of his death. On the same day he wrote a letter to Mrs. Monson assigning the policies and saying, " I am willing that you should hold the policies as security for all monies due to you from me, and as security against all liabilities incurred by you on my behalf, and in the event of my death occurring before the repayment of these monies you will be the sole beneficiary of these policies."

On Tuesday, 8th August, the day after the above two letters were written, a man arrived at Ardlamont in company with Mr. Monson. Ardlamont is only accessible from Glasgow and the Clyde by water, and the nearest pier to the house is at Kames, about four and a half miles off. This man, who travelled from Greenock by the same steamer as Mr. Monson, and who was apparently not familiar with the locality, left the steamer at Tighnabruaich, a pier about six miles from Ardlamont, and proceeded in the direction of Ardlamont by road. Mr. Monson, who landed at Karnes, drove back to meet him and brought him to the mansion-house, where he was introduced to the household as Scott, an engineer who had come to inspect the boilers of a yacht which Monson had purchased on behalf of Cecil. Scott took his meals with the family and was generally treated as a guest, although obviously not a gentleman in the social meaning of the word.

On the afternoon of Wednesday, 9th August, Monson and Scott went for a sail in a rowing boat, taking with them some of Mr. Monson's children. After dinner, at which Scott was present, the three men, Monson, Hambrough, and Scott, went down to Ardlamont Bay to engage in fishing. Monson and Cecil got into a boat in which was the net used for the fishing and Scott stayed on the shore. The party returned to the house about midnight, Monson and Cecil with their clothes soaked, both having somehow been immersed in the sea, but otherwise in good spirits and apparently treating the mishap as a joke. This misadventure was the cause of the Crown formulating the charge of attempted murder — the first head of the indictment under which Monson found himself in the dock. About six o'clock on the following morning, Thursday, 10th August, Mrs. Monson, accompanied by the governess and the children, left the house to go by boat to Glasgow for the day, and shortly afterwards Monson, Cecil, and Scott went out to shoot, Monson and Cecil each carrying a gun. The morning was wet and stormy. From the windows of the schoolhouse, which stands on the road to the mansion- house at the south end of the wood in which Cecil Hambrough met his death, the three men were seen by the witness Dunn walking along the road for a little in the direction of Ardlamont House and then crossing a fence to get into the field on the right-hand side of the road. After walking for a short distance in the field together, the three men were seen to spread out and enter the wood on the west side of the field in extended order, as if to beat the wood for rabbits, Scott, the man who had no gun, being in the middle. After entering the wood they were lost to Mr. Dunn's view, and nothing of them was again seen till some time after, when Monson and Scott returned to the house from the north end of the wood, passing the stables and offices on the way and bringing with them the two guns. On reaching the house Mr. Monson told the butler that Mr. Hambrough had been killed. The butler, accompanied by Monson and some of the estate servants, who were called upon to give assistance, went to the place where the body lay at the north end of the wood. It was found, with a gunshot wound in the head, lying on its back with the head towards the north, on the top of a sunk fence which divided the margin of the wood from a plantation of yoimg trees on the east. The sunk fence was about 4 1/2 feet in height, and at the bottom of it was a ditch overgrown by rank grass and bracken. The body was lifted and carried to the house, where the wound was washed. The local doctor was called in who, having examined the wound and received from Monson a statement as to the death, certified it as accidental. After luncheon Scott said that he had business to attend to which required that he should leave Ardlamont in the afternoon, and was told by the doctor that it was unnecessary for him to remain. He left by the afternoon boat for Glasgow and was not heard of again. Cecil Hambrough's father and mother were telegraphed for, and stayed at Ardlamont for two days. After their departure the body was taken by Monson to Ventnor, Isle of Wight, and was there buried, Monson returning to Ardlamont after the funeral. No suspicion was aroused as to the manner in which Cecil Hambrough had met his death until two officials of the Mutual Life Assurance Company came to Ardlamont on 23rd August to make inquiries concerning an application which had been made to the company for payment of the two insurance policies. They were taken by Monson to Inveraray to see the Procurator-Fiscal, and in consequence of what passed the Procurator-Fiscal began for the first time to look into the matter. The result of his inquiries was that he felt there was sufficient suspicion about the case to justify his putting the law in motion against Monson, and on 29th August Monson was arrested by the Chief Constable of Argyllshire. Orders were given for the exhumation of the body of Cecil Hambrough, and the examination following thereon resulted in a report hj the medical officer of the Crown and the doctor who had been called in at the time of the death, upon which a great part of the trial turned. Efforts were made both by the Crown and by Monson's legal advisers to find the man Scott, but without success ; not only were the utmost efforts of the police of the country unavailing, but also the advertisement which was widely made by Monson's law agent met with no response. Scott's connection with the matter yet remains the most inexplicable element of this mysterious case. Immediately after his arrest Mr. Monson called in the Iielp of Mr. John Blair, W.S., of Messrs. Davidson & Syme, Edinburgh, who, in due course, retained Mr. Comrie Thomson, Mr. John Wilson, and Mr. William Findlay, advocates, to conduct the case for the defence. Nearly three months were epent by those engaged in the case in preparing for the trial, and it was not till 12th December that Monson stood at the bar before the Lord Justice-Clerk and a jury to answer the charges made against him. Such, in brief outline, are the main facts of the story, the elucidation of which occupied the greater part of the ten days spent over the trial.

Before the trial actually began an interesting formality was gone through by the macer of Court calling upon Scott, the missing man, to appear ; upon his failing to do so, the judge passed sentence of outlawry against him.

As regards the first charge, namely, attempted murder by drowning late in the night of 9th August or early in the morning of the 10th, the theory of the Crown was that Monson took the boy out in a boat, in which he or Scott or both had previously cut a plug hole, and that when in deep water Monson removed the plug from the hole, with the result that the boat filled with water and sank, throwing them both into the sea, and that Monson, an expert swimmer, so attempted to drown the boy, who was unable to swim.

The defence explained the occurrence by saying that the hole was cut by Cecil himself for the purpose of emptying the boat of the water which accumulated during the course of fishing with the splash net, that Monson and the boy were thrown into the water by the boat capsizing through coming in contact with a rock, upon which Cecil clambered, and where he remained until Monson swam ashore and brought another boat to take him off. In his declaration on this matter Monson said — " So far from attempting on that evening to take young Hambrough's life, I consider that I saved it."

As regards the second charge, namely, that Cecil Hambrough met his death at the hand of another, and that other the prisoner at the bar, the Crown's theory was that he was killed by a glancing shot from a 12-bore gun, loaded with amberite powder, fired from behind at a distance of about 9 feet to the south of where he was standing at the time ; that he lay where he fell, and died from loss of blood. This 12-bore gun was admittedly the gun by which the fatal shot was fired and was not the gun which Cecil was in the habit of using, Monson at first stated that the boy was carrying a 20-bore gun, but subsequently stated that on the occasion of the accident he himself was carrying the boy's short 20-bore gun with, which Cecil usually shot, the latter having taken his (Monson's) 12-bore that morning in order to try new amberite cartridges.

In working out this theory many elements were taken into consideration, such as the nature and direction of the wound, the position of the body when first seen by others than Monson and Scott, and the traces of blood on the ground. Stress was also laid upon the position in which a blood-stained cartridge wad and two small pieces of bone, proved to be pieces of the skull, were found in relation to the body. Marks of pellets in trees to the northward of where the body was found lying afforded the main clue upon which was based the Crown theory as to the direction of the fatal shot and the distance from the deceased at which it was fired. Elaborate experiments to test such points as the spread of shot, the relation between the distance from which a shot is fired and the signs of discoloration and singeing in the object fired at, were explained in evidence and put to the jury as bearing out the theoiy that it was the prisoner's hand which had done Cecil Hambrough to death.

The defence, for their part, contended that the place where the body was seen by the butler and the others who went to carry it to the house was not the place where it was first found by Monson and Scott, and that they had lifted it from the ditch where it was lying and placed it upon the higher level of the sunk fence. That being so, they argued, the Crown theory as to the line of fire fell to the ground, and Mr. Comrie Thomson very pertinently pointed out in his address to the jury that the position of the body when seen by the witnesses, namely, lying on its back with the head pointing north, and upon which the Crown's case was largely founded, was utterly inconsistent with the theory that it had been shot from behind and from the south and that it lay where it fell.

As has been already indicated, the motive for the alleged crime assigned by the Crown was the prisoner's belief that by causing the death of Cecil Hambrough he would, through his wife — to whom the insurance policies over the boy's life purported to be assigned — reap the benefit of these policies, amounting to the large sum of £20,000. It was proved beyond doubt that the Monsons were literally penniless at the time and entirely dependent upon such small doles as they were able to get from their friend Tottenham and others ; it was argued that Monson, in ignorance of the elementary rule of law in Scotland as in England, that a minor cannot make a valid assignment without the consent of his guardians, believed that the assignment of the policies was good ; and that the death of Cecil Hambrough was the coping-stone of a deeply laid scheme by which Monson sought to rehabilitate his broken- down financial condition.

The defence met this theory by arguing that the prisoner was well aware of the boy's incapacity to assign before attaining majority and of the impossibility of Mrs. Monson recovering anything under the policies if Cecil died before twenty-one. In explanation of the letters relating to the assignment, it was argued that they were to be read merely as a declaration of indebtedness by Cecil, which could be referred to when the boy came of age, so that the Monsons might secure repayment of the advances which they had undoubtedly made to both the boy and his father and get discharge of Monson's bill for board and education, towards which he had not received one penny from Major Hambrough during the long time the boy was a member of his household. The defence admitted that a claim had been made to the insurance company after Cecil Hambrough's death, but Mr. Tottenham, who made the claim on behalf of Mrs. Monson, admitted in the witness-box that in doing so he was trying to " bluff " the insurance company into paying the money, £4000 of which he was to receive, by agreement with Monson, as his share of the spoil. The defence summed up their position on the matter of motive by pointing out that Monson had everything to lose and nothing to gain by the death of the boy before he reached the age of twenty-one, and that if the prisoner wished by his death to gain pecuniary advantage he killed him some months too soon and chose the very worst time for doing the boy to death.

These theories for the prosecution and the defence, of which an outline has been given, were put to the jury by the Solicitor- General and by Mr. Comrie Thomson in speeches which were worthy of the importance of the case. That of the Solicitor- General was a model of skilful forensic oratory, marked by great sincerity and at the same time by that fairness which, it is hoped, will always remain a characteristic note in the speeches of the law officers of the Crown in Scotland. Mr. Comrie Thomson's address on behalf of the prisoner worthily Upheld the high standard set by Lord President Inglis in his speech in defence of Madeleine Smith, the opening w^ords of which, it is interesting to note, were quoted by Mr. Comrie Thomson. In urging upon the jury the necessity of bringing to the discharge of their duty an unprejudiced mind, Mr. Comrie Thomson referred in strong terms to the hostile attitude taken up by the press of the country towards the prisoner from the date of his arrest.

The Lord Justice-Clerk, in his careful and exhaustive charge to the jury, gave due prominence to the many doubts and difficulties in the case which the prosecution had left unsolved, and then the jury retired to consider their verdict. On their return to Court the foreman announced that the verdict of the jury was " not proven " on both charges. The prisoner was released from the dock and passed quietly out of Court, and the great trial came to an end. The Ardlamont mystery was still a mystery, and so it is likely to remain for a long time to come.

An echo of the case was heard in May of the following year, when the mysterious Scott appeared in an Edinburgh music-hall as part of a conjurer's equipment, and during his stay in Edinburgh petitioned the High Court of Justiciary to recall the sentences of outlawry against him, which was done, the Crown putting in no appearance against him.

Ripon Observer - Thursday 13 November 1890

LORD CANTELUPE DROWNED.

Lord Cantelupe has been drowned in Belfast Lough. It seems that at the height of the storm, on Thursday night, the yawl Urania, having on board Viscount Cantelupe, eldest son of Earl Delawarr, was driven ashore. The disaster occurred within a stone's throw of a terrace of houses at the foot of the main street of the village of Bangor. The night was one of the wildest ever remembered in the district. The Urania anchored about 300 yards from the shore on Thursday evening, having arrived during the day from Glasgow, where Lord Cantelupe recently purchased the vessel. As the gale increased in violence,and the sea constantly broke over the Urania, considerable anxiety was felt on shore for the safety of the yawl. At two o'clock yesterday morning signals of distress were sent up from the Urania, and it became evident that she was drifting fast upon the Saltpan Rock. The sea ran so high, the wind was blowing with such terrific force, and the night was so dark, that to launch a boat at that moment would have been reckless folly. The Urania therefore drifted with no hope of assistance from the shore, and finally, about ten minutes past two, struck upon the rocks. Her keel seemed to have struck in a rocky cleft, and in that perilous position she remained for about two hours with the FURIOUS WAVES BREAKING CLEAN OVER HER. It was impossible for any living soul to remain upon the yacht's storm-swept deck, and Lord Cantelupe and his seamen decided to take to the rigging, in which position they would be clear of the waves, although exposed to the furious biting cold wind. The yacht, too, was beginning to till, and it was evident that no time was to be lost. Lord Cantelupe went first, but just as he had reached the top step and was stooping down with a buoy on the arm which clasped the rigging, and the other hand extended to help the next man, a tremendous sea struck the little craft, and the unfortunate young nobleman, who at that moment was cheerily encouraging his men, was SWEPT HEADLONG INTO THE BOILING SURF, and was never seen again. After a few ineffectual attempts the life-line was caught by one of the yacht's crew, and the exhausted storm-beaten seamen were safely hauled ashore after theee hours of very hard work. The body of Lord Cantelupe has not yet been recovered. The young nobleman's untimely end has aroused the greatest sympathy, not only on his own account, but on that of his young wife, to whom he was married only last June. The members of the crew are deeply grieved at the fate of the young nobleman, who during the short time that he was on board had shown a most affable and kindly disposition. Captain Buzzard states that his lordship had hold of a lifebuoy, but just before he was swept overboard he dropped it, probably because his limbs had become numbed by the cold.

Viscountess Cantelupe is at present staying with her mother at Wallhampton Park, Lymington. The deceased was only 24 years of age.

THE ARDLAMONT MYSTERY. EXHUMATION OF THE BODY.

A Ventnor correspondent telegraphs that yesterday afternoon the remains of the late Lieutenant Windsor Cecil Dudley Harabrough, who was believed to have been accidentally shot Ardlamont, Scotland, were exhumed in the churchyard of the parish church of St. Catherine's, Ventnor, by order of the Home Secretary. Shortly after four o'clock Mr. J. G. McClulloch, of Inverary, Procurator Fiscal, and Mr. McNaughton, Deputy-Procurator Fiscal of Argylsbire, arrived with the authority of the Home Secretary. They were accompanied Dr. Littlejohn, of I j Edinburgh, and Dr. McMillan, the gentlemen who examined the body before burial, and were appointed to examiue the remains on behalf of the Crown;! and Dr. Sanders, Edinburgh, who was present on behalf of the accused, Mr. Monson. Dr. Whitehead, of Ventor, afterwards joined them in the interests of the Harobrongh family. Major Hambrough arrived at Ventnor in time to witness from the high road the excavations the graveyard. In answer to Inquiries, Major confirmed the statement that two insurances for £lO,OOO each were effected on his son's life and assigned to Mrs. Monson, and not to Mr. Monson. Beyond this declined to commit himself to any statement, remarking that in sense was in the hands of the police, and did not feel liberty to make any observations with regard to the case. The body was encased a massive oak coffin with silver mountings. On its removal from the grave, it was placed a hearse and taken to the mortuary at Ventnor Cemetery, which situated the upper range of hills in lino with St. Boniface Down. The investigation. It is stated, shewed that the shot must have been tired from a distance, as there was mark of singeing surrounding the wound. The body was not re interred until 10 o'clock. Another correspondent states that on the coffin lid being raised, was found that rapid decomposition had set in, but the specialty appointed medical men were none the less able to make the necessary examination, the body being laid oil-sheets the grass outside the mortuary, the public being vigorously excluded from the cemetery. Photographs of the deceased's head were token before and after dissection, shewing the nature and extent of the fatal wound. Major Hambcough, who formally identified the coffin, wa) a distracted spectator the whole proceedings. In the coarse of conversation subsequently, Major Hotnbrough said it was a fact that his son's life had been insured in two sums of £lO,OOO each, and that both policies hod been assigned to Mrs, Monson, whose husband is in custody connection with the case. He aided that the fact that some shots which lodged in a tree entered a level with his son's head strongly inclined him the belief that there had been foul play. Mr. Monson, when at Ventnor. was accompanied by person who gave the name of Stevens. occupied rooms the Royal Marine Hotel, and an official there states that soon after dinner on the first evening of their stay—Monday, August 21st—Mr. seemed very depressed, and was very unwell, in consequence, be said, of worry through the sad accident, and of having entertained a large party bis castle Scotland. So bad, indeed, did he become that it was found necessary to send for a local doctor, who prescribed for him. and next day he was much better. the Tuesday evening be left the hotel and proceeded to the station, where met Lientenant Hambroogh's father, and escorted him to the hotel, where they both remained until after the fnnersl Wednesday, when Mr. Moneon discharged the account, and they left together. On Sunday a large number people entered the churchyard to look at the grave. Though Mr. Monson visited the vicar at the time of the funeral, that gentleman was unaware of his identity, but believed him to ho the Scotch undertaker. Mr. Monson described how the accident was supposed have happened, bis account exactly corresponding with that published. At the graveride the vicar noticed that Mr. Monson was greatly affected, which, to use his own words, surprised him, for had never seen an undertaker weep funeral before. Mr. Monson's statement led the vicar to take his text the following Sunday evening "There is but step between me and death,” and in his die I course made special reference to the occurrence, I describing it as it had been spoken of to him. The body was brought Ventnor in charge of gentleman believed to be the missing Mr. Hcott. When asked how the accident occurred, this gentleman said, "I was sat with the party, but no one really knows how it happened." Mr. Scott remained until after the funeral. Mrs. Monson, the wife of the prisoner, a youngish 1 lady nrepossessing appearance, and is the daughter Mr. Fisher, largo and well-known colliery proprietor | the Barnsley district Yorkshire. The publication of the fact in the newspapers that Scott is wanted has resulted in the officials Invorary being literally deluged with telegrams regarding the movements of men bearing similar name. None of them, however, referred to the proper person. The authorities ate still vigorously prosecuting the search for him.

The gun happened to be loaded, and Card blew the top of his skull off. He was not dead then, but the doctors stated it would be impossible for him to recover.

THE SCOTCH MYSTERY

MAJOR HAMBROUGH'S VIEWS. HYPNOTISM SUGGESTED.

A reporter Glasgow evening paper has had interview with Major Hambrouph, the father of the late Lieutenant Hambrough, and some remarkable Btatexneot* are the result. It appears that Major Hambrough was introduced to Mr. in 1892, and in that year placed his son under his care as tutor, being nrfloenced take this course by Monson's high recommendations and his connections. After joined the family, however, caw of the deceaeed, and were very much concerned at the fact that did not visit home. They had even taken preliminary stupe appeal the law to compel Lieutenant leave Monson, but the proceedings were cropped, because the voting man's repeated promisee to return home, and because the feeling that the courts would not interfere View of the fact that he had nearly attained his majority.

The Ardlamont Mystery. The Missing 'Scott.' (By *Telegraph*.)

LANGHOLM, Noon.— A bookmaker answering to the description of 'Scott' attended Haithwaitegate Coursing Meeting on November 24th. The meeting is held about seven miles from Langholm and thirteen from Carlisle. The man was in very delicate health, and did his work very quietly. It is also now known to the police authorities that a man of precisely the same description was in lodgings in Carlisle for nearly a week the beginning of this month, and that he disappeared without paying his lodgings. His landlady states that he was evidently a betting man, and seldom stirred out till night. His only luggage was a handbag. He mentioned names to her the same as those which have since appeared in the evidence at the trial The description of this man tallies very exactly with that subsequently published of "Scott," and he appeared to be a stranger the coursing meeting.

Criticism of the "Not Proven" Verdict— The Benefit of the Doubt.

The Ardlamont case has caused merits of the verdict of "not proven" to be discussed in the Temple, says a legal critic in the *Globe*. There is much to be said both for and against it, but, on the whole, the feeling is opposed to it. A verdict of "not proven" inevitably means social ruin the person of whom is returned, but if the jury cannot make their minds that the prisoner is guilty is it right that they should be able to inflict this punishment upon him ? In giving the prisoner the benefit of tha doubt they express the doubt so severely that there is little moral benefit in it. It is claimed, on the other hand, that the Scotch system is more humane than our own, because in several cases in which English juries have returned a verdict of guilty, trusting the Home Secretary to mitigate the sentence of death, a Scotch jury would have brought in a verdict of "not proven." In more than one famous criminal trial in Scotland the jury have returned a verdict of " not proven" by a majority. Such was the result of the well-known case of Smith, who was accused of shooting a young farmer, upon whose life he held a policy of insurance. On this occasion the judge ventured to do what very few occupants of the bench have done. After the jury had returned their verdict, he asked whether they were divided between "not proven" and "guilty" or between "not proven " and "not guilty." He was informed that the difference had arisen upon the former alternative. Clearly this was a most improper question to address to the jury, and only on very rare occasions has such inquiry been made.

THE ARDLAMONT MYSTERY

Herewith we give a portrait of the missing Scott for whose arrest a reward of £200 is offered by the police in connection with the Ardlamont tragedy. Concerning Scott a strange story reaches us from Londonderry. A hairdresser in that town states that a person answerting to the official description of the missing man called at his shop on November 15 and had his moustache shaved off. The man's demeanout was uneasy. Questioned as to why he was having his moustache shaved off he explained that he was carrying out a joke, and gave the address of a friend, which turns out to be false. The hairdresser is firmly of opinion that Scott is no other than the stranger he shaved.

IMAGE - TO DO

The hunt for Scott, however, seems to be going forward less keenly because it is noiseless. It is only natural, perhaps, that all sorts of rumours should be floating in the air. Thus it was announced in least one quarter on Saturday, of course from the usual "trustworthy source," that the fugitive might even yet be caught— "if the information received by authorities is correct."  "If" is at all times a pretty safe qualification. The actual fact is, at the time of the receipt of the intelligence on which these remarks are founded, that no official tidings have come to hand of the capture of the one man who is needed to complete the cycle of the Ardlamont mystery.

SCOTT IN CARLISLE

HE WAS ALLOWED TO SLIP AWAY — HIS LANDLADY's STORY

Interest in the Ardlamont case seems to be sustaining itself day by day by means of the missing man Scott. The Press Association's Carlisle correspondent states that on 19 Dec. a woman who lets lodgings in Carlisle reported to the city police that a man answering to the description of Scott, and evidently a betting man, had lodged at her house from 30 Nov. to 5 Dec., when he left without paying for his lodgings. He carried a revolver, and spoke of persons afterwards named in the Ardlamont case, and seldom went out until the evening. The Chief Constable forwarded the information to the Chief Constable of Argyllshire, but the man had then been gone a fortnight.

It is now placed beyond doubt (according to the Central News) that Scott has been staying in Carlisle. He attended Haithwaite Gate coursing meeting in North Cumberland, and before that he was seen in Newcastle by betting men who knew him. He is well known in Carlisle, where he has attended race meetings.

On the 2nd inst. Scott attended service in a Methodist chapel with his landlord. On the following Tuesday he was much upset on hearing his landlady read from a newspaper the report that a warrant had been issued for the arrest of Scott, and he decamped the same night after buying some collars and ties. It is supposed that he took a train for the south.

London Evening Standard - Saturday 30 December 1893

THE ARDLAMONT MYSTERY. SUPPOSED SUICIDE OF SCOTT

Some excitement was caused to-day in the neighbourhood of Old Ford-road, Bow, by a report that the missing man Sweeney or Scott, who is wanted in connection with the Ardlamout mystery, had committed suicide in a lodging-house near by. It appears that early yesterday morning a man whose description tallies with that circulated by the police with reference to Scott, applied for a bed at a common lodginghouse in Old Ford-road. He was accommodated, and apparently fell asleep till 10.30 a.m., when a boy who occupied the next bed spoke to him. He answered the boy, and appeared rather excited, but no notice was taken of that, nor was anything thought of it till later in the day, when the landlady on going into the room found him lying in bed in a pool of blood. She at once communicated with the police, and Police-constable Clark, 247 K, was quickly on the spot. He found the man dead, and on examining the bed saw a British bull-dog revolver lying near his right hand, the muzzle pointing towards the Deceased's head on which just over the temple was a bullet wound. The Coroner was informed, and his officer removed the body to the Bow Mortuary. The police have circulated the following description :--Age about 33 ; length, 5ft. 9in. ; complexion, fair; hair and moustache, brown ; eyes: grey, one (the right) discoloured. He was dressed in a dark grey mixture coat and vest, dark striped trousers. military braces marked 55063 R.A. 1C35[?], dark flannel shirt, light grey ??, white collar, black satin scarf, black hard felt hat, marked "G. C. Davis, hatters, 25[?]6, Strand," white handkerchief, marked "H and 3-203," four gold studs, and white pocket knife with three blades. This description being almost the same as that supplied of the missing man, the police are now trying to find the firneds of Scott, with the view to their seeing the body of the dead man.

The woman with whom the man suspected to be Scott lodged in Carlisle made a further statement yesterday bearing upon her lodger's identity. She says he wore on his watch chain a silver medal engraved with the letters "E. D." On being questioned as to these initials, which differed from those of Joseph Thompson, the name by which he was known, he said they meant " Edward Davies," which name he had borne until 16 years old, adding that he had three or four names. On Tuesday, the 5th December, he turned scarlet when his landlady read out to him a reward was offered for the capture of Scott. He at once read the announcenient himself, and said he was going to the post-office to stop his letters front coming there. He left the same day without paying for his lodgings. The landlady further states that he had a deep scar on the left jaw, and that the right forefinger was wanting from the second joint. He had blue eyes and sallow complexion. In an illustrated paper there was a portrait of Scott reproduced from a photo, and that portrait she said was the very image of her lodger, except that the portrait had a moustache, whereas her lodger had none, but was growing one.

Mr. Thomas McNaughton, the Inverary official who had charge of the Ardlamont case, has, in consequence of the recent observations of Monson in reference to the prosecution, written to the *Scotsman*, stating exactly what was done by the officials. It was on August 10 that the Procurator Fiscal was informed of Lieutenant Hambrough's death. "On August 11, with the earliest opportunity available, I proceeded to Ardlamont, arriving there in the evening, accompanied by a police officer, who had previously handed me his report embodying the mresult of his inquiries, and also the result of the doctor's examination. I, on the evening of the same day, examined and took down in writing the statements of the witnesses, who were said to have first seen the body after the alarm was gibven by Monson. I also examined Monson. I then proceeded to the *locus*, which was pointed out to me by Monson, after which I returued to Ardlamont House and made an examiniation of the wound in deceased's head, thereafter returning to Tighnabruaich. The following day I had to proceed to other parts of the county on official business, and was unable to return to Inverary until the afternoon of August 15th, when I reported the result of my inquiries to the Porcurator Fiscal, who the following morning communmicated with the Glasgow officials, fully stating the case, and requesting them to take a minute and careful deposition from 'Scott,' and if not found at the address given to wire at once. Bit the Glasgow authorities failed to find the man, and stated so by wire and letter. On receipt of the letter, the constable at Tighnabruaich was wired by the Procurator Fiscal to proceed to Ardlamont and ascertain from Monson 'Scott's' whereabouta. Wires were received on the following day, August 22, both from the constable and Monson, stating that the latter would call next day, August 23, and explain matters. On the latter date Monson arrived, accompanied by Mr. Tottenham and the two insurance officials, and had an interview with the Procurator Fiscal and myself. The object of the visit, I learned, was not to give any information regarding 'Scott's' whereabouts, but for another purpose in connection with insurance. Next day the Procurator Fiscal and myself proceeded to Tighnabruaich and took further evidence. We returned the following day to Inverary and communicated at once with the proper authorities for instructions." As to what Monson said respecting Mr. McNaughton, this official desires simply to point out that it is untrue. "I beg to characterise it as a deliberate untruth that I was at Ardlamont on August 10, and it follows that I could not possibly have, as Monson says I might have done, wired to have 'Scott' stopped on the arrival of the boat, and have asked him to return. It will be understood that I am precluded from giving any information as to what Monson's statements to me were as to 'Scott' and other matters; and, further, that in the early stages of the inquiry it was impossible to verify or contradict any information obtained from Monson."

THE ARDLAMONT MYSTERY , scarfs STORY OP THE TRLOEDY• In the Pall Mall Gazette, Scott, the witness who was wanted but could not be found during the investigation of the Ardlamont case, relates the story of ' the death of Lieutenant Hambrough. Scott, according to the account he gives, was roused soon after • daybreak on the morning "f August 10 to go out on the rabbit shooting expedition which had so fatal an ending. The trio had not proceeded far in the wood when Monson and Hambrough separated Scott keeping in the rear to pick up the dead rabbits —when he heard a single shot fired. He called out something to the effect, " what have you got 7" He received no reply, and concluded it was a miss. In a very short time he caught up with Mr. Monson, and about 15 or 20 yards further on the lifeless body of the ill-fated Cecil Hambrough was found. According to Scott, "shortly after midday it was an undoubted, admitted fact, that Mr. Hambrough had met his death by an accidentally self-inflicted wound caused by the going off of his own gun." As to his disappearance from Ardlamoot, he declares that having ascertained from Dr. MacMillan that there would be no inquest, he left the place quite openly, speaking of the accident to a policeman on the pier at Tighnabruaich, and giving that officer his Glasgow address.

THE ARDLAMONT MYSTERY. OFFERED SURRENDER OF SCOTT.

Scott, the man who disappeared when the Ardlamomt mystery aroused so much comment, offered to surrender, on Thursday, to the police in London. He has made a declaration to the effect that his name is Edward Sweeney, that at one time he was known as Ted Davies, bookmaker, that in August last year, under the name of Scott, be passed three days at Ardlamont, as Hanson's guest, and that he is the person against whom a warrant was issued for the alleged murder of Cecil Hambrough.

The Press Association says :—" The attempt to impart significance to the appearance of Scott has by no means disturbed the equanimity of the London police authorities. Scott is not in custody, and at present the Scotland Yard authorities have no intention of depriving him of his liberty. Such a course will entirely depend upon the Procurator-Fiscal in Edinburgh who will, it is expected, decide what course will be adopted."

THE ARDLAMONT MYSTERY. "THE DISAPPEARING MAN."

Edward Sweeney, *alias* Davis, *alias* Scott, who was charged along with Monson in the Ardlamont case, and who at the time absconded, is at present residing in Edinburgh, for the purpose of taking steps to have the sentence of outlawry passed upon him removed. He has presented a petition to the High Court of Justiciary stating that he is not guilty of the charge of murder then preferred against him, and that he is now ready to meet it. The authorities will, however, have nothing to do with him. His petition has been served on the Lord Advocate, and will probably come before the court when it meets this week, but the likelihood is that no appearance will be made for the Crown, and that the prayer of the petition, in the absence of opposition, will be granted, and the sentence of outlawry removed. In the meantime " Scott" seems inclined to turn his notoriety to good account. He enters to-day on a week's engagement at the Empire Palace Theatre, where he appears in Professor Morritt's illusion as "The disappearing man."

The Scotsman - Tuesday 22 May 1894

YESTERDAY, Mr Edward Sweeney, *alias* Scott, had his sentenco of outlawry recalled. Mr Sweeney, it will be remembered, was present at Ardlamont House on the morning that young Hambrough was shot. He was there under the name of Scott, and he had been introduced to different persons as an engineer. He was not an engineer, and his name, as we know, was not Scott. He has explained how it came about that he was represented as an engineer, and how he took the name of Scott, and that explanation has no doubt been weighed by the public. It was not given at the trial of Monson on a charge of murdering Hambrough. Sweeney was indicted along with Monson and as he did not appear, a sentence of outlawry was pronounced against him. The Crown sought to get evidence into the trial to prove that the Scott who was present at Ardlamont was Mr Sweeney, and it was not permitted. The police had been searching for Mr Sweeney for many weeks, and had not found him. He turned up subsequently at the instance of a London newspaper ; and now he has come to Scotland to ask that the sentence of outlawry against him shall be recalled. His request was granted yesterday under some peculiar conditions. The Court had no opportunity of learning what the Crown thought on the subject. Sentence of outlawry had bean pronounced against Mr Sweeney at the instance of the Crown. His petition for a recall of the sentence had been intimated to the Crown officials. Yesterday had been appointed for the hearing of the petition ; and when he came before the High Court of Justiciary no representative of the Crown was present, and not a word of guidance was given to the Court by any one on behalf of the Crown. Most properly this course was strongly commented upon by the Lord Justice-Clerk and by Lord Adam. They said that it seemed to be a dereliction of duty on ths part of the Crown. What they said will have the approval of the country. It should be remembered that the Judges who sit on the bench have only to administer the law. It is tha business of the Crown to bring to the knowledge of the bench all the facts it can gather in reference to any and every case that comes into Court in connection with criminal matters. If this be not done, the Judges are left almost entirely without guidance, and obviously there may be a serious miscarriage of justice. We are not saying or suggesting that anything of the kind has taken place in regard to this case ; but it must be said that the absence of the Crown from the hearing of the petition placed the Judges in a position in which they ought not to have been left. Mr Sweeney has got his sentence of outlawry recalled, and has thereby made another precedent in the administration of criminal law in Scotland. It may be hoped that the Crown's dealing with the question will not be regarded as a precedent to be followed in the future.

Mr. Charles Morritt's appearance at St. George's Hall, after an absence of many years, has awakened many recollections of his earlier career in the magical world. It was Mr. Morritt who invented the illusion of "The Disappearing Lady," and afterwards caused a sensation during the period of the Ardlamont mystery, by producing Scott, "the missing man," on the stage, when scores of people were scouring the land in search of him.

GLASGOW

Gaiety.— Charles Morritt, in his illusion "THe Missing Man", is the centre of attraction at this hall. The "missing man" is no other than "Scott", of Ardlamont mystery fame, his reception being of a very mixed character. The illusion, however, is good; the disappearance only occupying five seconds.
