Trial of A.J. Monson, ed. John W. More, 1908 

INTRODUCTION.

The trial of Alfred John Monson on the double charge of attempting to murder and of murdering Windsor Dudley Cecil Hambrough at Ardlamont, Argyllshire, may be placed in the list of Scottish trials as the most important which has taken place since that of Madeleine Smith, nearly fifty years ago ; and, as in the case of that trial, the most abiding interest to students of criminology lies in the fact that the verdict was that anomalous and peculiarly Scottish one of " not proven," and that the mystery which was seen to enfold the case from the first was not dispelled by any definite pronouncement by the jury. Not only was the charge against the prisoner the most serious which any man has to face at the hands of his fellow-men, but also the circumstances of the alleged crime, the place where it occurred, and the social position of the accused and of his alleged victim were of such a kind as at once to arrest attention and to make people look with interested eyes to the High Court of Justiciary in Edinburgh, where, on 12th December, 1893, the prosecution and the defence began their efforts, extending over ten long days, to get at the heart of the mystery. But as day by day the evidence unfolded itself, and as the rival theories upon which the Crown and the defence were staking their respective cases came to be apparent, the interest became deepened until, throughout the length and breadth of the country, men were busy with the solution of the problems of the case which soon came to be known, and has continued to be known, as " The Ardlamont Mystery."

Round the question of how the boy Cecil Hambrough came by death was woven, as the trial proceeded, a web of evidence the like of which, in complexity and in diversity, has been surpassed in no criminal trial in Scotland. In the attempt by the Crown to show to the satisfaction of the jury that the accused man was guilty as libelled, and in the attempt to refute this contention, the counsel on either side brought forward the evidence of diverse and dissimilar witnesses, from the unlettered testimony of ploughmen, grooms, domestic servants, and game-keepers, to the expert evidence of surveyors, gunmakers, and medical men of great experience and high standing. The motive which the Crown sought to prove in order to strengthen their contention was the accused man's belief that by the death of Cecil Hambrough he would be financially a gainer to a considerable extent, and for the proving and disproving of this element of the case a tangle of financial enterprises in which the prisoner had been engaged for several years had to be unravelled by the evidence of actuaries, insurance officials, and financial men of many and varied hues. The case was further complicated by the evidence relating to the identity and disappearance of Scott, the alleged accomplice of the prisoner, that enigmatic figure which flitted across the stage at the most critical moment of the drama, coming from where no man knows and disappearing beyond the ken of men.

Although undoubtedly, of all the evidence which was led during the trial, that which dealt most intimately with the young man's death is, from a sensational point of view, of most clamant interest, yet there are many eddies and backwashes of the stream of evidence which are well worthy the attention of those who have the taste for studying the minutiae of a great trial ; and, looking at the case from a purely technical point of view, it is important on account of the legal points which came up for decision and which form an appendix to this report.

The uncontroversial facts of the case revealed during the progress of the trial are briefly these. In 1890 Mr. Monson was introduced to Major Hambrough, the father of Cecil Hambrough, by Mr. Tottenham, a London financier, and at Major Hambrough's request Mr. Monson undertook the custody and tuition of the boy Cecil, then seventeen years of age, till he should pass into the army, and for his services Mr. Monson was to be paid at the rate of £300 a year. At this time Major Hambrough was in a state of financial difficulty, and had mortgaged his life interest in certain family estates to an insurance company which had foreclosed, that is, had made itself owner of the interests mortgaged. Soon after taking up his duties as tutor to the boy Mr. Monson entered into negotiations with Major Hambrough with a view to relieving the Major's embarrassment, and these negotiations went on for some time. In 1892, however, for some reason a rupture occurred in the relations between Mr. Monson and the Major, who, from this time onward, used all his influence to induce his son to leave his tutor's house. In this he was unsuccessful, and Cecil continued to stay with Mr. Monson, most of his time being spent at a place in Yorkshire, where Monson was then residing.

In August, 1892, Mr. Monson was adjudicated bankrupt. In January, 1893, negotiations were entered into by him and Cecil with a view of raising money on the boy's expectancy in the Hambrough estates, but in February these broke down. Shortly after this Mr. Monson began to communicate with a firm of shooting agents in London in order to obtain the lease of a shooting in Scotland for the season, and in May a lease of Ardlamont House and shootings, in Argyllshire, was entered into in the names of Cecil Hambrough and Mr. Jerninghani, a gentleman whom Mr. Monson represented as being Cecil's guardian and good for the rent. The rent was £450 for the season, half to be paid by 1st August, under the condition that if it were not paid within a certain number of days thereafter the lease was to be void. Mr. Monson with his family went north to Ardlamont, and Cecil Hambrough joined them after finishing his training with the Yorks Militia, in which he held the rank of lieutenant. At this period and for some time before Mr. Monson and Cecil were being financed by Mr. Tottenham. In July Mr. Monson commenced to negotiate with Messrs. J. & F. Anderson, W.S., Edinburgh, agents for the proprietor of Ardlamont, for the purchase of the estate by Cecil Hambrough, but the price offered by Monson on behalf of Cecil was so inadequate that the agents would not consider it and the negotiations came to nothing. At the same time attempts were being made to effect an insurance over the life of Cecil Hambrough, and, after proposals to several insurance companies had been refused, owing to difficulties as to the insurable interest of those proposing the insurance, a proposal by Cecil Hambrough for insurance on his own life for £20,000, divided into two policies of £10,000 each, was accepted by the Mutual Life Assurance Company of New York, and the first premium, amounting to £194, was paid by Monson out of a cheque sent for another purpose by Tottenham. The policies were dated 4th August, and on 7th August Cecil Hambrough wrote to the manager of the Mutual Assurance Company, asking him to deliver them to Mr. or Mrs. Monson and saying that he had assigned them to Mrs. Monson for proper consideration and that she would be the person to whom the insurance money would be payable in the event of his death. On the same day he wrote a letter to Mrs. Monson assigning the policies and saying, " I am willing that you should hold the policies as security for all monies due to you from me, and as security against all liabilities incurred by you on my behalf, and in the event of my death occurring before the repayment of these monies you will be the sole beneficiary of these policies."

On Tuesday, 8th August, the day after the above two letters were written, a man arrived at Ardlamont in company with Mr. Monson. Ardlamont is only accessible from Glasgow and the Clyde by water, and the nearest pier to the house is at Kames, about four and a half miles off. This man, who travelled from Greenock by the same steamer as Mr. Monson, and who was apparently not familiar with the locality, left the steamer at Tighnabruaich, a pier about six miles from Ardlamont, and proceeded in the direction of Ardlamont by road. Mr. Monson, who landed at Karnes, drove back to meet him and brought him to the mansion-house, where he was introduced to the household as Scott, an engineer who had come to inspect the boilers of a yacht which Monson had purchased on behalf of Cecil. Scott took his meals with the family and was generally treated as a guest, although obviously not a gentleman in the social meaning of the word.

On the afternoon of Wednesday, 9th August, Monson and Scott went for a sail in a rowing boat, taking with them some of Mr. Monson's children. After dinner, at which Scott was present, the three men, Monson, Hambrough, and Scott, went down to Ardlamont Bay to engage in fishing. Monson and Cecil got into a boat in which was the net used for the fishing and Scott stayed on the shore. The party returned to the house about midnight, Monson and Cecil with their clothes soaked, both having somehow been immersed in the sea, but otherwise in good spirits and apparently treating the mishap as a joke. This misadventure was the cause of the Crown formulating the charge of attempted murder — the first head of the indictment under which Monson found himself in the dock. About six o'clock on the following morning, Thursday, 10th August, Mrs. Monson, accompanied by the governess and the children, left the house to go by boat to Glasgow for the day, and shortly afterwards Monson, Cecil, and Scott went out to shoot, Monson and Cecil each carrying a gun. The morning was wet and stormy. From the windows of the schoolhouse, which stands on the road to the mansion- house at the south end of the wood in which Cecil Hambrough met his death, the three men were seen by the witness Dunn walking along the road for a little in the direction of Ardlamont House and then crossing a fence to get into the field on the right-hand side of the road. After walking for a short distance in the field together, the three men were seen to spread out and enter the wood on the west side of the field in extended order, as if to beat the wood for rabbits, Scott, the man who had no gun, being in the middle. After entering the wood they were lost to Mr. Dunn's view, and nothing of them was again seen till some time after, when Monson and Scott returned to the house from the north end of the wood, passing the stables and offices on the way and bringing with them the two guns. On reaching the house Mr. Monson told the butler that Mr. Hambrough had been killed. The butler, accompanied by Monson and some of the estate servants, who were called upon to give assistance, went to the place where the body lay at the north end of the wood. It was found, with a gunshot wound in the head, lying on its back with the head towards the north, on the top of a sunk fence which divided the margin of the wood from a plantation of yoimg trees on the east. The sunk fence was about 4 1/2 feet in height, and at the bottom of it was a ditch overgrown by rank grass and bracken. The body was lifted and carried to the house, where the wound was washed. The local doctor was called in who, having examined the wound and received from Monson a statement as to the death, certified it as accidental. After luncheon Scott said that he had business to attend to which required that he should leave Ardlamont in the afternoon, and was told by the doctor that it was unnecessary for him to remain. He left by the afternoon boat for Glasgow and was not heard of again. Cecil Hambrough's father and mother were telegraphed for, and stayed at Ardlamont for two days. After their departure the body was taken by Monson to Ventnor, Isle of Wight, and was there buried, Monson returning to Ardlamont after the funeral. No suspicion was aroused as to the manner in which Cecil Hambrough had met his death until two officials of the Mutual Life Assurance Company came to Ardlamont on 23rd August to make inquiries concerning an application which had been made to the company for payment of the two insurance policies. They were taken by Monson to Inveraray to see the Procurator-Fiscal, and in consequence of what passed the Procurator-Fiscal began for the first time to look into the matter. The result of his inquiries was that he felt there was sufficient suspicion about the case to justify his putting the law in motion against Monson, and on 29th August Monson was arrested by the Chief Constable of Argyllshire. Orders were given for the exhumation of the body of Cecil Hambrough, and the examination following thereon resulted in a report hj the medical officer of the Crown and the doctor who had been called in at the time of the death, upon which a great part of the trial turned. Efforts were made both by the Crown and by Monson's legal advisers to find the man Scott, but without success ; not only were the utmost efforts of the police of the country unavailing, but also the advertisement which was widely made by Monson's law agent met with no response. Scott's connection with the matter yet remains the most inexplicable element of this mysterious case. Immediately after his arrest Mr. Monson called in the Iielp of Mr. John Blair, W.S., of Messrs. Davidson & Syme, Edinburgh, who, in due course, retained Mr. Comrie Thomson, Mr. John Wilson, and Mr. William Findlay, advocates, to conduct the case for the defence. Nearly three months were epent by those engaged in the case in preparing for the trial, and it was not till 12th December that Monson stood at the bar before the Lord Justice-Clerk and a jury to answer the charges made against him. Such, in brief outline, are the main facts of the story, the elucidation of which occupied the greater part of the ten days spent over the trial.

Before the trial actually began an interesting formality was gone through by the macer of Court calling upon Scott, the missing man, to appear ; upon his failing to do so, the judge passed sentence of outlawry against him.

As regards the first charge, namely, attempted murder by drowning late in the night of 9th August or early in the morning of the 10th, the theory of the Crown was that Monson took the boy out in a boat, in which he or Scott or both had previously cut a plug hole, and that when in deep water Monson removed the plug from the hole, with the result that the boat filled with water and sank, throwing them both into the sea, and that Monson, an expert swimmer, so attempted to drown the boy, who was unable to swim.

The defence explained the occurrence by saying that the hole was cut by Cecil himself for the purpose of emptying the boat of the water which accumulated during the course of fishing with the splash net, that Monson and the boy were thrown into the water by the boat capsizing through coming in contact with a rock, upon which Cecil clambered, and where he remained until Monson swam ashore and brought another boat to take him off. In his declaration on this matter Monson said — " So far from attempting on that evening to take young Hambrough's life, I consider that I saved it."

As regards the second charge, namely, that Cecil Hambrough met his death at the hand of another, and that other the prisoner at the bar, the Crown's theory was that he was killed by a glancing shot from a 12-bore gun, loaded with amberite powder, fired from behind at a distance of about 9 feet to the south of where he was standing at the time ; that he lay where he fell, and died from loss of blood. This 12-bore gun was admittedly the gun by which the fatal shot was fired and was not the gun which Cecil was in the habit of using, Monson at first stated that the boy was carrying a 20-bore gun, but subsequently stated that on the occasion of the accident he himself was carrying the boy's short 20-bore gun with, which Cecil usually shot, the latter having taken his (Monson's) 12-bore that morning in order to try new amberite cartridges.

In working out this theory many elements were taken into consideration, such as the nature and direction of the wound, the position of the body when first seen by others than Monson and Scott, and the traces of blood on the ground. Stress was also laid upon the position in which a blood-stained cartridge wad and two small pieces of bone, proved to be pieces of the skull, were found in relation to the body. Marks of pellets in trees to the northward of where the body was found lying afforded the main clue upon which was based the Crown theory as to the direction of the fatal shot and the distance from the deceased at which it was fired. Elaborate experiments to test such points as the spread of shot, the relation between the distance from which a shot is fired and the signs of discoloration and singeing in the object fired at, were explained in evidence and put to the jury as bearing out the theoiy that it was the prisoner's hand which had done Cecil Hambrough to death.

The defence, for their part, contended that the place where the body was seen by the butler and the others who went to carry it to the house was not the place where it was first found by Monson and Scott, and that they had lifted it from the ditch where it was lying and placed it upon the higher level of the sunk fence. That being so, they argued, the Crown theory as to the line of fire fell to the ground, and Mr. Comrie Thomson very pertinently pointed out in his address to the jury that the position of the body when seen by the witnesses, namely, lying on its back with the head pointing north, and upon which the Crown's case was largely founded, was utterly inconsistent with the theory that it had been shot from behind and from the south and that it lay where it fell.

As has been already indicated, the motive for the alleged crime assigned by the Crown was the prisoner's belief that by causing the death of Cecil Hambrough he would, through his wife — to whom the insurance policies over the boy's life purported to be assigned — reap the benefit of these policies, amounting to the large sum of £20,000. It was proved beyond doubt that the Monsons were literally penniless at the time and entirely dependent upon such small doles as they were able to get from their friend Tottenham and others ; it was argued that Monson, in ignorance of the elementary rule of law in Scotland as in England, that a minor cannot make a valid assignment without the consent of his guardians, believed that the assignment of the policies was good ; and that the death of Cecil Hambrough was the coping-stone of a deeply laid scheme by which Monson sought to rehabilitate his broken- down financial condition.

The defence met this theory by arguing that the prisoner was well aware of the boy's incapacity to assign before attaining majority and of the impossibility of Mrs. Monson recovering anything under the policies if Cecil died before twenty-one. In explanation of the letters relating to the assignment, it was argued that they were to be read merely as a declaration of indebtedness by Cecil, which could be referred to when the boy came of age, so that the Monsons might secure repayment of the advances which they had undoubtedly made to both the boy and his father and get discharge of Monson's bill for board and education, towards which he had not received one penny from Major Hambrough during the long time the boy was a member of his household. The defence admitted that a claim had been made to the insurance company after Cecil Hambrough's death, but Mr. Tottenham, who made the claim on behalf of Mrs. Monson, admitted in the witness-box that in doing so he was trying to " bluff " the insurance company into paying the money, £4000 of which he was to receive, by agreement with Monson, as his share of the spoil. The defence summed up their position on the matter of motive by pointing out that Monson had everything to lose and nothing to gain by the death of the boy before he reached the age of twenty-one, and that if the prisoner wished by his death to gain pecuniary advantage he killed him some months too soon and chose the very worst time for doing the boy to death.

These theories for the prosecution and the defence, of which an outline has been given, were put to the jury by the Solicitor- General and by Mr. Comrie Thomson in speeches which were worthy of the importance of the case. That of the Solicitor- General was a model of skilful forensic oratory, marked by great sincerity and at the same time by that fairness which, it is hoped, will always remain a characteristic note in the speeches of the law officers of the Crown in Scotland. Mr. Comrie Thomson's address on behalf of the prisoner worthily Upheld the high standard set by Lord President Inglis in his speech in defence of Madeleine Smith, the opening w^ords of which, it is interesting to note, were quoted by Mr. Comrie Thomson. In urging upon the jury the necessity of bringing to the discharge of their duty an unprejudiced mind, Mr. Comrie Thomson referred in strong terms to the hostile attitude taken up by the press of the country towards the prisoner from the date of his arrest.

The Lord Justice-Clerk, in his careful and exhaustive charge to the jury, gave due prominence to the many doubts and difficulties in the case which the prosecution had left unsolved, and then the jury retired to consider their verdict. On their return to Court the foreman announced that the verdict of the jury was " not proven " on both charges. The prisoner was released from the dock and passed quietly out of Court, and the great trial came to an end. The Ardlamont mystery was still a mystery, and so it is likely to remain for a long time to come.

An echo of the case was heard in May of the following year, when the mysterious Scott appeared in an Edinburgh music-hall as part of a conjurer's equipment, and during his stay in Edinburgh petitioned the High Court of Justiciary to recall the sentences of outlawry against him, which was done, the Crown putting in no appearance against him.

Dundee Evening Telegraph - Saturday 12 August 1893

YOUNG GENTLEMAN SHOT DEAD IN BUTE.

A sad shooting fatality happened on Thursday the estate Ardlament, some distance from Tighnabruaich. Mr Hambro *[sic]*, a young gentleman of 23 years, who is believed to have been a banker in America, and who was joint-tenant of the Ardlamont shootings along with Mr Monson, was shot dead while out shooting rabbits. The young gentleman was crossing dyke with his loaded gun, which he was carrying under his arm at full-cock. It is supposed that the trigger was caught bv the bushes, and this, it is believed, caused the gun accidentally to go off. The charge lodged in the unfortunate gentleman's head, and he was killed on the spot. His friends coming up immediately afterwards were too late to render any assistance. The body was removed to House, which is at present in the possession of the shooting tenants. The sad occurrence has cast a gloom over the district. Mr Hambro hod been staying at Ardlamout with his friend Mr Monson during the past three or four weeks.

The death of young Mr Hambrough, says the *N.B. Mail*, at Ardlament is singalany sad. He seemed to be one of " Fortune's children," with a life of happiness and ease before him. Had he lived till April next he would have attained his majority and inherited a fortune of about a quarter of a million, some £70,000 of which would probably have been devoted to the purchase of the Ardlamont estate, to which he had taken a strong liking since he became the shooting tenant a few months ago. Mr Hambro was a well-built, handsome young fellow, and his simple, frank, and courteous manners had already won him many friends in the district.

The Ardlamont Mystery

MONSON BEFORE THE SHERIFF

THE INSURANCE QUESTION.

SCOTT STILL LARGE.

Mr Alfred Monson was yesterday brought before Sheriff Shairp in the Courthouse, Inveraray, and judicially examined on the charge of causing the death of Mr Windsor Dudley Cecil Hamhrough, by shooting, at Ardlamont, on the 10th of the present month. After emitting his declaration, the accused was committed to prison for further examination. It is probable that he will brought up for his second examination after a lapse of eight days, and if he is then committed to prison he will be removed to Greenock, there to await his trial.

Accused in Prison.

Mr Monson is meantime living comfortably, if not luxuriously, at his own expense. His meals are brought into him from the George Hotel, which adjoins the Courthouse. On Wednesday he had a dinner of three courses. He had tea in the evening, and breakfast was carried to him before nine o'clock yesterday morning. In other respects he is being treated as an ordinary prisoner. He sleeps in his clothes on the raised wooden bed-shaped arrangement on the floor of the cell, with a couple of blankets thrown over him. He is said to be now feeling his position, it is believed, very keenly. While under police surveillance from Monday night till Wednesday morning his behaviour savoured something of bravado. On Tuesday he was out shooting on the moor in the company of some of his guests with a policeman walking on each side of him, and he drove about, dined, and slept constantly shadowed by representatives of the law, and never once did he show the least sign of annoyance or discomposure.

APPLICATION TO HOME SECRETARY.

The criminal authorities are preparing precognitions to be laid before Crown counsel. An application has been made to the Home Secretary for authority to exhume the remains of the young gentleman who is alleged have been murdered. Mr Hambrough's body was buried in the Isle of Wight in the family burial-ground there, and an official from Inveraray will go through to the Isle Wight to superintend the exhuming and examination the remains. From hints which have been dropped since Monson’s arrest, it is believed that, if the case goes to trial at all, the evidence will be of a rather sensational nature. It is now stated that Monson was not Hambrough’e legal guaidiau all, but only his tutor.

WARRANT TOR ARREST.

A warrant for the arrest the missing engineer, Edward Scott, was signed Wednesday night.

THE ACCUSED.

Alfred John Monson is the third son of the late Rev. Thomas John Monson, rector of Kirby-under-Dale. Yorkshire, his mother being the daughter of the fifth Viscount Galway. He was born in May, 1858, and is thus in his thirty-fourth year. Mr Monson is a member of the family of which Viscount Oxenbridge, the Master of the Horse, is the head, his grandfather, the Hon. and Rev. Thomas Monson, rector of Bedale, having been a son of the second Baron Monson, and the grand-uncle of the present peer.

THE DECEASED

Windsor Dudley Cecil Hambrough was thee eldest son of Dudley Albert Hambroug, Esq., of Steephill Castle, Isle of Wight. He was bron in 1873, and would have attained his majority early next year. He was a Lieutenant in the 4th Battalion Prince of Wales' Own Yorkshire Regiment. Lieutenant Hambrough’s father is a J.P. for Hants and the patron of two livings, and resides principally at Houghton, Stockbridge.

THE TRUE STORY OF THE INSURANCE

From a thoroughly reliable source the Glasgow *Evening Citizen* has learned all about the insurance negotiations, concerning which no end of rumours have been in circulation. Mr Hambrough being desirous of insuring his life approached the Mutual Life Assurance Society, of New York, through their Glasgow office, and, after the usual preliminaries of examination and references, a policy or policies amounting to £20,000 were taken out. When the insurance was being effected it was understood by the representatives of the Company that the policy was to be assigned to Mr Monson, with whom, indeed, there were one or more interviews on the subject. The question naturally arises, why should Mr Hambrough ASSIGN THE POLICY TO HIS FRIEND Mr Monson? The explanation seems a reasonable one. Mr Hambrough was desirous of purchasing the Ardlamont estate, and required money for this purpose. Although having the prospect of great wealth when he came of age, Mr Hambrough was not, in the meantime, in the possession of much money, and, as it was, was indebted to his friend Monson. The latter gentleman himself is reported not to be rich, but his wife is stated to be wealthy. Indeed, it is said that the intention first was to assign the policy to this lady and her children as the advances for the acquiring of the estate to be made out of her money. As events turned out, THE POLICY NEVER WAS ASSIGNED.

And for the best of all reasons — it had not been received from the head office in New York, and, of course, no transfer could take place without the principal document. Mr Hambrough had merely received a receipt or covering note pending the arrival of the policy. This, then, leads directly the conclusion that Mr Monson can derive no pecuniary benefit from the death of Mr Hambrough. Whatever may have been the intentions of the contracting parties, there has been no assignation whatever of the policy, and whoever the Mutual Life Aseurance Society of New York pay the £20,000 to it will certainly not be Mr Monson, but the relatives of the deceased gentleman.

Heseltine was talking with the landlord of the local public house, when the conversation turned upon the Ardlamont shooting mystery. Card insisted that it was possible that Mr. Hamborough's injuries were self-inflicted, and in order to demonstrate this he took up his gun, placed it behind his back with one hand, and reaching down the other hand, pulled the trigger. The gun happened to be loaded, and Card blew the top of his skull off. He is not dead yet, but the doctors state that it will be impossible for him to recover.

THE SCOTCH MYSTERY. EXHUMATION OP LIEUTENANT HAMBROUGH’S BODY.


TO DO

All arrangements having been completed, tho exhumation of the body of Lieutenant takes place this afternoon at Ventuor. The grave is in a churchyard which has for some time been disused, except for those having family vaults. It is in the centre busy street, and though the strictest privacy is to observed, the coffin will necessarily be exposed to the public view. For examination it will be removed to the mortuary, where it remained when brought from Scotland. Mr. Monson when Ventor was accompanied by person who gave the of Stevens. They occupied rooms the Royal Marine Hotel, and an official there states that soon after dinner the first evening of their stay—Monday, August 21. —Mr. Monson seemed very depressed, and was very unwell, in he said, of worry through the sad accident, and of having entertained a large party at his castle in Scotland. So bad, indeed, did become that it was found necessary to send for a local doctor, who prescribed for him, and next day was much better.

A Ventnor correspondent telegraphs that yesterday afternoon the remains of the late Lieutenant Windsor Cecil Dudley Harabrough, who was believed to have been accidentally shot Ardlamont, Scotland, were exhumed in the churchyard of the parish church of St. Catherine's, Ventnor, by order of the Home Secretary. Shortly after four o’clock Mr. J. G. McClulloch, of Inverary, Procurator Fiscal, and Mr. McNaughton, Deputy-Procurator Fiscal of Argylsbire, arrived with the authority of the Home Secretary. They were accompanied Dr. Littlejohn, of I j Edinburgh, and Dr. McMillan, the gentlemen who examined the body before burial, and were appointed to examiue the remains on behalf of the Crown;! and Dr. Sanders, Edinburgh, who was present on behalf of the accused, Mr. Monson. Dr. Whitehead, of Ventor, afterwards joined them in the interests of the Harobrongh family. Major Hambrough arrived at Ventnor in time to witness from the high road the excavations the graveyard. In answer to Inquiries, Major confirmed the statement that two insurances for £lO,OOO each were effected on his son’s life and assigned to Mrs. Monson, and not to Mr. Monson. Beyond this declined to commit himself to any statement, remarking that in sense was in the hands of the police, and did not feel liberty to make any observations with regard to the case. The body was encased a massive oak coffin with silver mountings. On its removal from the grave, it was placed a hearse and taken to the mortuary at Ventnor Cemetery, which situated the upper range of hills in lino with St. Boniface Down. The investigation. It is stated, shewed that the shot must have been tired from a distance, as there was mark of singeing surrounding the wound. The body was not re interred until 10 o’clock. Another correspondent states that on the coffin lid being raised, was found that rapid decomposition had set in, but the specialty appointed medical men were none the less able to make the necessary examination, the body being laid oil-sheets the grass outside the mortuary, the public being vigorously excluded from the cemetery. Photographs of the deceased’s head were token before and after dissection, shewing the nature and extent of the fatal wound. Major Hambcough, who formally identified the coffin, wa) a distracted spectator the whole proceedings. In the coarse of conversation subsequently, Major Hotnbrough said it was a fact that his son’s life had been insured in two sums of £lO,OOO each, and that both policies hod been assigned to Mrs, Monson, whose husband is in custody connection with the case. He aided that the fact that some shots which lodged in a tree entered a level with his son’s head strongly inclined him the belief that there had been foul play. Mr. Monson, when at Ventnor. was accompanied by person who gave the name of Stevens. occupied rooms the Royal Marine Hotel, and an official there states that soon after dinner on the first evening of their stay—Monday, August 21st—Mr. seemed very depressed, and was very unwell, in consequence, be said, of worry through the sad accident, and of having entertained a large party bis castle Scotland. So bad, indeed, did become that it was found necessary to send for a local doctor, who prescribed for him. and next day he was much better. the Tuesday evening be left the hotel and proceeded to the station, where met Lientenant Hambroogh’s father, and escorted him to the hotel, where they both remained until after the fnnersl Wednesday, when Mr. Moneon discharged the account, and they left together.

A DISASTROUS ARGUMENT:
 
A shocking sequel attended a discussion on the case at Wallhampton. Henry Card, gamekeeper, in the employ of Mr. J. P. Heseltine, was talking with the landlord of a local public-house, and insisted that it was possible that Mr. Hambrough's injuries were self-inflicted, and in order to demonstrate this he took up his gun, placed it behind his hack with one hand, and reaching down with the other hand pulled the trigger. The gun happened to be loaded, and Card blew the top of his skull off. He was not dead then, but the doctors stated it would be impossible for him to recover. Card succumbed to his injuries on Wednesday. He leaves a widow and nine children.

Exmouth Journal - Saturday 14 April 1894

THE ARDLAMONT MYSTERY , scarfs STORY OP THE TRLOEDY• In the Pall Mall Gazette, Scott, the witness who was wanted but could not be found during the investigation of the Ardlamont case, relates the story of ' the death of Lieutenant Hambrough. Scott, according to the account he gives, was roused soon after • daybreak on the morning "f August 10 to go out on the rabbit shooting expedition which had so fatal an ending. The trio had not proceeded far in the wood when Monson and Hambrough separated Scott keeping in the rear to pick up the dead rabbits —when he heard a single shot fired. He called out something to the effect, " what have you got 7" He received no reply, and concluded it was a miss. In a very short time he caught up with Mr. Monson, and about 15 or 20 yards further on the lifeless body of the ill-fated Cecil Hambrough was found. According to Scott, "shortly after midday it was an undoubted, admitted fact, that Mr. Hambrough had met his death by an accidentally self-inflicted wound caused by the going off of his own gun." As to his disappearance from Ardlamoot, he declares that having ascertained from Dr. MacMillan that there would be no inquest, he left the place quite openly, speaking of the accident to a policeman on the pier at Tighnabruaich, and giving that officer his Glasgow address.

THE ARDLAMONT MYSTERY. OFFERED SURRENDER OF SCOTT.

Scott, the man who disappeared when the Ardlamomt mystery aroused so much comment, offered to surrender, on Thursday, to the police in London. He has made a declaration to the effect that his name is Edward Sweeney, that at one time he was known as Ted Davies, bookmaker, that in August last year, under the name of Scott, be passed three days at Ardlamont, as Hanson's guest, and that he is the person against whom a warrant was issued for the alleged murder of Cecil Hambrough.

The Press Association says :—" The attempt to impart significance to the appearance of Scott has by no means disturbed the equanimity of the London police authorities. Scott is not in custody, and at present the Scotland Yard authorities have no intention of depriving him of his liberty. Such a course will entirely depend upon the Procurator-Fiscal in Edinburgh who will, it is expected, decide what course will be adopted."

The Scotsman - Tuesday 22 May 1894

YESTERDAY, Mr Edward Sweeney, *alias* Scott, had his sentenco of outlawry recalled. Mr Sweeney, it will be remembered, was present at Ardlamont House on the morning that young Hambrough was shot. He was there under the name of Scott, and he had been introduced to different persons as an engineer. He was not an engineer, and his name, as we know, was not Scott. He has explained how it came about that he was represented as an engineer, and how he took the name of Scott, and that explanation has no doubt been weighed by the public. It was not given at the trial of Monson on a charge of murdering Hambrough. Sweeney was indicted along with Monson and as he did not appear, a sentence of outlawry was pronounced against him. The Crown sought to get evidence into the trial to prove that the Scott who was present at Ardlamont was Mr Sweeney, and it was not permitted. The police had been searching for Mr Sweeney for many weeks, and had not found him. He turned up subsequently at the instance of a London newspaper ; and now he has come to Scotland to ask that the sentence of outlawry against him shall be recalled. His request was granted yesterday under some peculiar conditions. The Court had no opportunity of learning what the Crown thought on the subject. Sentence of outlawry had bean pronounced against Mr Sweeney at the instance of the Crown. His petition for a recall of the sentence had been intimated to the Crown officials. Yesterday had been appointed for the hearing of the petition ; and when he came before the High Court of Justiciary no representative of the Crown was present, and not a word of guidance was given to the Court by any one on behalf of the Crown. Most properly this course was strongly commented upon by the Lord Justice-Clerk and by Lord Adam. They said that it seemed to be a dereliction of duty on ths part of the Crown. What they said will have the approval of the country. It should be remembered that the Judges who sit on the bench have only to administer the law. It is tha business of the Crown to bring to the knowledge of the bench all the facts it can gather in reference to any and every case that comes into Court in connection with criminal matters. If this be not done, the Judges are left almost entirely without guidance, and obviously there may be a serious miscarriage of justice. We are not saying or suggesting that anything of the kind has taken place in regard to this case ; but it must be said that the absence of the Crown from the hearing of the petition placed the Judges in a position in which they ought not to have been left. Mr Sweeney has got his sentence of outlawry recalled, and has thereby made another precedent in tho administration of criminal law in Scotland. It may be hoped that tho Crown's dealing with the question will not be regarded as a precedent to be followed in the future.
