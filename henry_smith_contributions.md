# As Further Collected by Henry Smith

The claim that the tale of "The Three Little Pigs" was submitted to Halliwell some time earlier is attested to by an acknowledgment in the preface to the 1849 edition of *Popular Rhymes*, dated April, 1849, [p. ix-x](https://archive.org/details/popularrhymesan00hallgoog/page/n14/mode/2up):

> The compiler's best thanks are due to Captain Henry Smith for the very interesting communication of rhymes current in the Isle of Wight; ...

Smith is also cited in the 1849 edition in respect of the submission relating to Shrove Tuesday customs,  [pp. 246-9](https://archive.org/details/popularrhymesan00hallgoog/page/n266/mode/2up):

ISLE OF WIGHT SHROVERS

Until within about the last thirty years, it had been the custom in the Isle of Wight from time immemorial at all the farms and some other charitable houses to distribute cakes on Shrove-Tuesday, called Shrove-cakes, to the poor children of the parish or neighbourhood, who assembled early in the morning at the different villages, hamlets, and cottages, in parties of from two to thirty or more, for the purpose of what was denominated "Going Shroving," and the children bore the name of Shrovers. At every house they visited they had a nice Shrove-cake each given them. In those days the winters were much more inclement and of longer duration than at the present time, and it often happened that, in addition to a severe frost, the ground was covered several inches high with snow, yet however cold or intense the weather, it did not prevent these little ones from what they called in the provincial dialect *Gwine a Shrovun*, and they jogged merrily along hand in hand from one house to another to obtain their cakes; but, before receiving them, it was expected and deemed necessary that they should all sing together a song suitable to the occasion; those who sang the *loudest* were considered the *best Shrovers*, and sometimes had an extra cake bestowed on them; consequently, there was no want of noise (whatever there might have been of harmony) to endeavour to get another Shroving gift. There were many different versions of the song according to the parishes they lived in. The one generally sang by the children of the East Medina was as follows:

A Shrovun, a Shrovun,  
I be cum a Shrovun,  
A piece a bread, a piece a cheese,  
A bit a your fat beyacun.  
Or a dish of doughnuts,  
Aal of your own meyacun!

A Shrovun, a Shrovun,    
I be cum a Shrovun,  
Nice meeat in a pie.  
My mouth is verrey dry!  
I wish a wuz zoo well a-wet,  
I'd zing the louder for a nut!

*Chorus.* 
A Shrovun, a Shrovun,  
We be cum a Shrovun!

The song of the children of the West Medina was different:

A Shrovun, a Shrovun,  
I be cum a Shrovun,  
Linen stuff es good enuff,  
Vor we that cums a Shrovun.  
Vine veathers in a pie.  
My mouth is verrey dry.  
I wish a wuz zoo well a-wet,  
Then I'd zing louder vor a nut!

Dame, `[The mistress of the house, if past the middle age« was called Dame, i. e. Madame.]` dame, a igg, a igg, `[An egg an egg]`  
Or a piece a beyacun.  
Dro awaay `[Throw away]` the porridge pot.  
Or crock to bwile the peeazun.  
Vine veathers in a pie,  
My mouth is verrey dry.  
I wish a wuz zoo well a-wet,  
Then I'd zing louder vor a nut!

*Chorus*.

A Shrovun, a Shrovun,  
We be cum a Shrovun!

If the song was not given sufficiently loud, they were desired to sing it again. In that case it very rarely required a second repetition. When the Shrovers were more numerous than was anticipated, it not unfrequently happened that, before the time of the arrival of the latter parties, the Shrove-cakes had been expended; then dough-nuts, pancakes, bread and cheese, or bread and bacon, were given, or halfpence were substituted; but in no instance whatever were they sent from the door empty-handed. It is much to be regretted that this charitable custom should have become almost extinct; there being very few houses at the present time where they distribute Shrove-cakes.

"There was another very ancient custom somewhat similar to the Shroving, which has also nearly, if not quite, disappeared; probably it began to decay within the last half-century: this was a gift of cakes and ale to children on New Year's Day, who, like the Shrovers, went from house to house singing for them; but, if we may judge from the song, those children were for the most part from the towns and larger villages, as the song begins, *"A sale, a sale in our town!"* there is no doubt but it was written for the occasion some centuries since, when "a sale" was not a thing of such a common occurrence as now, and when there was one, it was often held in an open field in or near the town." So writes my kind and valued correspondent, Captain Henry Smith, but *town* is, I think, merely a provincialism for *village*. It is so, at least, in the North of England. As for the phrase *a seyal*, it seems to be a corruption of *wassail*, the original sense having been lost. The following was the song:

A seyal, a seyal in our town,  
The cup es white and the eal es brown;  
The cup es meyad from the ashen tree,  
And the eal es brew'd vrom the good barlie.

*Chorus.* Cake and eal, cake and eal,  
A piece of cake and a cup of eal;  
We zing merrily one and aal  
For a piece of cake and a cup of eal.

Little maid, little maid, troll the pin\*, 
Lift up the latch and we'll aal vail in; `[]`
Ghee us a cake and zum eal that es brown,
And we dont keer a vig vor the seyal in the town.  

*Chorus.* W'ill zing merrily one and aal  
Vor a cake and a cup of eal;  
God be there and God be here.  
We wish you aal a happy New Year.

[\* That is, turn the pin inside the door in order to raise the latch. In the old method of latching doors, there was a pin inside which was turned round to raise the latch. An old Isle of Wight song says, —

Then John he arose.  
And to the door goes.  
And he trolled, and he trolled at the pin.  
The lass she took the hint.  
And to the door she went.  
And she let her true loye in.]
```

The above was the original song, but within the last fifty or sixty years, as the custom began to fall off, the chorus or some other part was often omitted.

THE WOOD-PIGEON.

An Isle of Wight legend respecting this bird tells us that, soon after the creation of the world, all the birds were assembled for the purpose of learning to build their nests, and the magpie, being very sagacious and cunning, was chosen to teach them. Those birds that were most industrious, such as the wren and the longtailed-capon, or pie-finch, he instructed to make whole nests in the shape of a cocoa-nut, with a small hole on one side; others, not so diligent, he taught to make half-nests, shaped something like a teacup. Having thus instructed a great variety of birds according to their capacity, it came to the turn of the wood-pigeon, who, being a careless and lazy bird, was very indifferent about the matter, and while the magpie was directing him how to place the little twigs, &c., he kept exclaiming, "What, athurt and across! what zoo! what zoo! — athurt and, across! what zoo! what zoo!" At length the magpie was so irritated with his stupidity and indolence, that he flew away, and the wood-pigeon, having had no more instruction, to this day builds the worst nest of any of the feathered tribe, consisting merely of layers of cross-twigs.

DRAGON-FLIES.

In some parts of the Isle of Wight, these insects are found of a peculiarly large size, and their colours are extremely beautiful. There is an old legend respecting them which is still current. It is supposed by the country people that their sting or bite is venomous, as bad as that of a snake or adder, and perhaps from this belief their provincial name of snake-stanger or snakestang is derived. It is said that these insects can distinguish the good children from the bad when they go fishing: if the latter go too near the water, they are almost sure to be bitten; but when the good boys go, the dragon-flies point out the places where the fish are, by settling on the banks, or flags, in the proper direction. This curious myth is commemorated by the following song:

Snakestanger! snakestanger! viae aal about the brooks;  
Sting aal the bad bwoys that vor the vish looks.  
But lat the good bwoys ketch aal the vish they can.  
And car'm awaay whooam `[Carry them away home.]` to vry em in a pan;  
Bred and butter they shall yeat at zupper wi' their vish.  
While aal the littul bad bwoys shall only lick the dish.

This has of late years been introduced into the nursery, but in different suit of clothes:

Dragon fly! dragon fly! fly about the brook;  
Sting all the baa boys who for the fish look;  
But let the good boys catch all that they can.  
And then take them home to be fried in a pan;  
With nice bread and butter they shall sup upon their fish,  
While all the little naughty boys shall only lick the dish.

New Year's Day

Wasael or Wassal, — A remnant of this part of our Saxon manners still exists at Yarmouth, and strange to say, in no other part of the Isle of Wight. On the first day of the new year the children collect together and sing wassel or wassal through the streets; the following is their song (see p. 249):

Wassal, wassal, to our town!  
The cup is white and the ale is brown;  
The cup is made of the ashen tree.  
And so is the ale of the good barley;  
Little maid, little maid, turn the pin.  
Open the door and let us come in;  
God be here, God be there.  
I wish you all a happy new year!

*It would be interesting to know if any of the correspondence between Henry Smith and James Halliwell-Phillips are held in the [Collection of James O. Halliwell-Phillips](https://archives.collections.ed.ac.uk/repositories/2/resources/323) at the University of Edinburgh.*

As well as his contributions to Halliwell's *Popular Rhymes*, Henry Smith also collected words in the Isle of Wight dialect, published posthumously by *The English Dialect* in 1881 in [Series C, volume XXII](https://archive.org/details/originalglossari12skeauoft/page/n5/mode/2up) of the *Original Glossaries* series, *Isle of Wight Words; by the late Major Henry Smith, R.M., and C. Roach Smith*, with an introduction by Rev. Professor Walter W. Skeat:

> THE five Glossaries in the present volume have been thrown together in rather a fortuitous manner, by the accident that they were offered to the ENGLISH DIALECT SOCIETY nearly at the same time. The original intention was to publish the MS. which is referred to in Halliwell's Dictionary (Preface, p. xx) in the following terms: —
> 
> "No printed glossary of Isle of Wight provincialisms has yet appeared; but a very valuable one in MS., compiled by Captain Henry Smith, was most kindly placed at my disposal by his relative, Charles Roach Smith, Esq., E.S.A. It has been fully used in the following pages."
> 
> This MS. collection Mr. Roach Smith has now offered to the Society, and has added to this the favour of editing it himself, with all such corrections and additions as seemed to him to be most advisable.

C. Roach Smith's preface to the Isle of Wight glossary provides a potted biography of his brother, Henry:

> THIS Glossary was compiled, some years ago, at my suggestion, by my brother, the late Major Henry Smith, R.M. Endowed with a remarkably retentive memory; with a thoughtful and reflective mind; born in a farm-house; I might say, born to the plough; passing his early years in the midst of farm-labourers, and engaged in the various duties of farm life, he possessed peculiar advantages for the task; and he left but little for me to add. I have, however, exercised my discretion in another direction, and have omitted much in derivations that was superfluous, while I have retained every word essential to assist in giving a full and proper notion of the dialect, and of the pronunciation; indeed, it is possible I have given a few which might have been omitted.

I HERE give further illustrations of the use of some words in the Glossary, from Major Smith's letters, addressed to me during the compilation. The extracts also exemplify further the general pronunciations. Mrs. Moncrieff's poem and some other reprinted matter will also be serviceable in the same direction. I avail myself of this opportunity to give a few brief notices of customs, superstitions, traditions, songs, etc. peculiar to, or connected with, this island, all of which, though necessarily somewhat rambling, I trust will be found interesting and not unworthy the Society under whose auspices the Glossary is published.

> __Dack.__ "Back means a gentle or slight blow or touch. Washerwomen sometimes use it getting up their linen after washing, when they clap or beat the small things between their hands. I think they use it to signify that the work must be done gently. But it has a different meaning in the field; for the man holding the plough, if the boy should not drive exactly as he ought to do, would say: 'I tell thee what, buoy, if thee dos'nt dreyve them hosses out at end better anuther time, I'll ghee thee a dack wi' the zull paddul and knock thee down, and zee how theed'st like that.'"
> 
> __Dout.__ "Your inquiry has brought to my recollection an occurrence that took place very many years since. When Jan Taailor lived under Keertur at Landguard, a boy, by the name of Davies, was doing the duty (*pro tempore*) of meyat. I was, on a winter's evening, in the stable, where, at one part of it, sat Jan and myself busily employed breeding the thong of a whip with the help of an extra lanthern; and the boy at the usual work with the stable lanthern hanging over his head. The candle of the latter being nearly expended, Jan was desirous of its being extinguished and replaced by a new one. This led to the following dialogue:—
>
> *Jan.* Bwoy!
> 
> *Boy.* Hulloh!
> 
> *Jan.* Goo and dout that candle and git anutther.
> 
> *Boy.* I doant think theck wat's in the lanturn now's burn'd out it.
> 
> *Jan.* How not burn'd out? Dosn't zee the snawf's burn'd 'tirely down into the zocket?
> 
> *Boy.* I can't dout un tell I done varmun out the steyabul.
> 
> *Jan.* Odd deyannashun seyze thee! If thee closn't goo derreckly minnut and do as I tells thee, I' 11 ketch hold o' the whip and drap in to thee reddy to cut thee aal to pieces. (Making a motion to put his threat into execution.)
> 
> *Boy.* I be gwine zoo vast as I can.
> 
> *Jan.* And zoo best, else I'll zoon zee where thee casn't dout un bevore theest done varmun out the steyabul or no.
> 
> *Boy.* (Aside.) Odds blastnashun! My rnind nothun doant zim to vaay noohow to-night.
> 
> *Jan.* What bee' st yoppelun about now?
> 
> *Boy.* I dedn't zay nuthun.
> 
> *Jan.* Look sharp and dout the Hot then, or els I'll zoon meyake thee zay zummut.
> 
> *Boy.* Well, I be got at ut now beeant I?
> 
> *Jan.* What aail' d thee that thee coodsn't doo't at vust then? (Addressing himself to me.) That are's a mooust miseryeabul unbeleevun buoy; the steyabul won't be big enuff to hold us boouth much longer, I can zee that.
> 
> The meyat having substituted a new candle, the conversation between them ended, and was carried on between myself and Jan, who, having swallowed a pint of eal (or Yeal), soon regained his usual good temper; and now you will perceive that the word dout occurs four times in this dialogue, which I believe to be literally as was spoken."

The word *dout* (do out) is not confined to the Isle of Wight; and it occurs in Shakespeare and other old writers; but it does not seem to be used in Kent.

> __Dumbledore__ and __Straddlebob__. "I recollect perfectly the late Mr. James Phillips of Merston relating a dialogue that occurred between two of his labourers relative to the word straddlebob, a beetle. These two were working together in a field (spreading dung). At the time of luncheon, one of them, on taking his brencheese out of a little bag, saw something that had found its way there while the ba» was lying under the hedge, which led to the following sapient discourse:—
> 
> *Jan.* What's got there you?
> 
> *Will.* A blastnashun straddlebob craalun about in the nammut bag.
> 
> *Jan.* Straddlebob! Where ded'st leyarn to caal'n by that neyam?
> 
> *Will.* Why, what shoud e caal' n? Tes the right neyam esn ut?
> 
> *Jan.* Right neyam? No! Why, ye gurt zote vool, casn't zee tes a duinbledore.
> 
> *Will.* I knows tes; but vur aal that, straddlebob's zo right a neyam vor'n as dumbledore ez.
> 
> *Jan.* Come, I'll be deyand if I doant laay thee a quart o' that.
> 
> *Will.* Done! and I'll ax Meyastur to-night when I goos whoam, bee't how't wool.
> 
> Accordingly, Meyastur (Mr. Phillips) was applied to by Will, who made his decision known to Jan the next morning. Will. I zay, Jan! I axed Meyastur about that are last night. Jan. Well: what ded ur zay? Will. Why a zed one neyam ez jest zo vittun vor'n as tother; and he lowz a ben caal'd straddlebob ever zunce the Island was vust meyad. Jan. The devvul a hav! If that's the keeas I spooas I lost the quart. Will. That thee hast lucky; and we' 11 goo down to Arreton to the Rid Lion and drink un ater we done work!"

The following poem has been printed in 'The Gentleman's Magazine' (1863), appended to a brief memoir I gave of the writer, my cousin, Mrs. Moncrieff. It was composed and written for this Glossary on her death-bed, at the Bride of Earn, near Perth. Mrs. Moncrieff was born at Wroxall, three or four miles distant from Landguard, our birth-place; and there she lived until her marriage. The poem contains some words which were not in my brother's list; and of these two or three may have been almost obsolete by the time my brother, considerably her junior, entered upon the duties of the farm. The poem has merit beyond its dialectic interest; and has justly been admired. The late Mr. Albert Way called it "charming;" and urged me to reprint it.

A DREAM OF THE ISLE OF WIGHT.

"I dreampt of thee, Vectis, and thine, as of yore:  
Joy thou in thy change, while mine I deplore.  
My dream was of seeking for emmets again,  
For my pheasants, in nooks made soft by the rain.  
I was climbing the shoot at the side of the butt;  
The path by a founder of hummock was shut.  
So I lopped o'er the fence to the ramshackled shed,  
Where cattle was foddered, and mud calves were fed.  
For good cowed milk, thought I, this will do;  
But the kittle was empty; the cows were assue.  
A man in a corner, in smock frock and strogs,  
Lolled, lazily sorting the mores and the logs;  
For he grubbed like a want; one source of his pelf,  
Being, trapping the heaving blind roamer himself:  
A larapping fellow, a native I'll vouch  
By his hybrid gait, twixt a lounge and a slouch.  
He was dunch as a plock; and fully as dull;  
Then, inwardly grumbling, he handled a zull  
Which he wistfully tighted from right hand to left;  
And then declined meddling because of the heft.
From a neighbour's small bargain, a plot of few Ings  
He cultures as garden, and as freehold hugs;  
Where too, among greens, small fruits, and ruds,  
A wire stops the hare, as nibbling she scuds.  
Out thence the fleet comer never will go;  
But wait, in close covert, the thuckster's 'So, ho.'  
The cur at his heel can larger game harry,  
A lank scaithy whelp, trained to fetch and to carry.  
As he skulks through the copses for sparods and ledgers,  
Which he stealthily sells to thatchers and hedgers.  
He, with the long yawn of habitual delay,  
Said, - 'Tell me aneuse the time of the day;  
The duck's coming on; I'll be off in astore,  
The fry will be burnt, though 'twas swimming galore:  
My Gimmer's at market; one calf she will sell,  
Eeserving the lebb, pluck, and haslet as well.  
I know she was hindered on peering the flick;  
But there she is coming; and just in the nick.  
No empty backcoming whenever she roams;  
And now 'tis a griskin that on her head bomes;  
Why behold her, close by, just only there look,  
Nighst the old gallybeggar, by the corn pook.  
We'll thrugh the church litten, and leather that troop  
Kicking there up a dust, all high cock-a-hoop.'  
Fate hangs on a moment; whilst going they stood,  
A waddling, clamorous pair and their brood,  
From the dwyes of the withy-hed where they dived,  
For a feast on the long earth-bred eaces arrived.  
When, wo to the mallard! a death-dirge his quack.  
With her younglings his mate a widow went back.  
Then I said, 'Ducks will serve where one cannot get geese:'  
He leered and slunk off, just drawling out 'Ees.'  
Then waking, dream, dreamer were lost without trace,  
Leaving Yectis identical only in place."

The following extracts are in point, both as showing Major Smith's perception of deviations from strict local pronunciation, and as examples of the dialect.

"Did you read Zeary Tullidge's evidence in 'The Hampshire Independent'? There was some pretty genuine Isle of Wight dialect, with one or two exceptions, where they make her say 'werry' instead of 'very.' This she never pronounced in that way 'I'll be bound vor't.' Who ever heard an Isle of Wight person talk like that? Noobody upon the feyace of the yeath I know! They can pronounce the V well enough in the Island; and of all other letters in the alphabet they use it the most frequently, and almost invariably instead of the F; more particularly when that letter is the leading consonant. For instance, they would not say, 'The first frost froze the floor;' but 'the vust vrost vroze the vloor:' therefore it is not likely wold Zeary called *very* 'werry.'"

HANTS COUNTY SESSIONS. Saturday, October 26, 1844.

"Sarah Header (17) was charged with stealing half-a-crown from the widow Tullage, a garrulous old daine o'er whose brows the snows of nearly eighty winters had passed. The manner of her giving her evidence created no little amusement in the Court. 'That ere gal,' said she, 'cum into my house a vortnight gorn by, an axed me if I wanted a cap. I zed I didn't as I know'd on. She axed zixpence for un; then vourpence. I took dreepence out o' th' zugar pot a' top o' the dresser, where zhe zet, and gid her vor un. There was a pus in the pot wi' a half-crown in un. She had un thirty years; and she could recollect the giver; and the pus had sliding rings, and a hole in the middle to put the money in. I took out the pus, and zhe zid un; and then I gid her a apple to make ur a pudden, and I put the pus in the pot agen, and when zhe was gone the pus was gone. I never zid ur take un, cause I turned my back to ur, and he hadn't got eyes in un; but I heer' d suinmat rattle, and there was ne'er a child there, nor nobody else wasn't there; no, nobody, neither chick nor child. I wexed wery much about un; but I never zid the pus agen. A thief and a liar be two o' the wost things in the wordle. Zhe dedn't lave me a hapenny to help myself, and I be zebnty-zebn, and ben a slave all my life.'

"The old woman was again placed at the bar, and being desired to look at the prisoner again, she exclaimed, 'No, no, I never wants to zee her veace agen. I ded zay I thought zhe waan't zoo *tall*; but zhe had un. My zight edn't very good, but that be zhe;' and turning round she exclaimed to the prisoner with great vehemence of manner, 'Ye huzzy, what do 'e think ull become o' ee? The devil 'ull have 'ee as zure as thee beest alive. Thee ought to ha' thee vlesh flogged from thee boanes, to zarve a poor ould woman zo.'"

The use of the present for the past tense in the verb to come, exemplified in the foregoing report, is universal in the Isle of Wight and throughout Hampshire also; and it is by no means confined to the uneducated. In the course of the Tichborne trial the faulty orthography of the Claimant's writing was commented on. The Lord Chief Justice remarked that the letters of the real Sir Roger were not free from grammatical errors; and he instanced an example of the use of the present instead of the past tense, not knowing that this very fact tended to show his Hampshire origin, and that this peculiar error would not be likely to occur in the writing or speaking of a Londoner.

A clever poem which appeared in 'Punch' in 1855, is, like the above report, convicted of mistakes which prove, as my brother remarks, that it could not well have been written by a native of the Island

ZONG (AS) ZUNG AT ZHORREL HARVEST WHOAM!

An I'me meakun a zlipknot to hang myzelf wee,  
Vrom the dead branch as grows vrom the wold wamut tree."

From a Contributor to Punch. (Oct., 1855.)

14 Thank you for the Isle of Wight zong. The man who wrote it seems to know the Isle of Wight dialect pretty well, although I do not think he is a native, as you will perceive in the last verse he has used a w instead of a v. This a true native never does; and he also calls it Harvest Whoam. The natives, that is, the country folks, invariably call it 'Whooam Harvest.' He is probably a London visitor who has lived some time in the Island, and mixed with the working people a good deal.

"Dr. Gaunt of Shanklin, a retired naval surgeon, used to say that he could speak five languages, French, Italian, Spanish, English, and Isle of Wight; but he could not speak Isle of Wight; nor do I believe any person can who was not born there, or who had not passed his earlier days there. Even the late Dr. Wavell (of Newport), who prided himself on knowing it well, I have heard pronounce words as no true Isle of Wight countryman ever did.

"In the above song there are a few other words misspelt, as 'old' for 'wold'; 'zold' for 'zoold'; 'hould' for 'hoould'; 'watercraces' for 'watersgraces'; 'lade' for 'lead'; 'proy' for 'praay'; and 'whoy' for 'whaay.'"

The following song, which constituted part of the vocal entertainment at the home-harvest at Landguard, I give from memory. Mr. Halliwell-Phillipps has printed two versions of it in his 'Nursery Rhymes' for the Percy Society, 1844. It will be seen that mine is more complete. In 1834 Mr. Buckstone introduced it in 'The May Queen'; but very imperfectly. In a note to the printed copy he says, "This song was sung about the streets of London more than forty years ago, by an old street-singer, who never sang any other; the late Mr. Charles Dibden, the younger, who had heard him, wrote the words from recollection, and at my request presented me with a copy." — J. B. B. It will be seen that, on comparing it with mine, it is a poor paraphrase, void of all the spirit and character of the original.

1.

The old carrion crow he sat upon an oak,  
Fol the rol, the rol, the rol, the rido.  
And he saw a saucy tailor cutting out a coat,  
With heigho, the old carrion crow cried caa, caa,  
Fol the rol, &c.

2.

"Wife, go and fetch me my arrow and my bow,"  
Fol the rol, &c.  
"That I may shoot this old carrion crow  
That cries caa, caa, caa,"  
Fol the rol, &c.

3.

The tailor he shot, but he missed his mark;  
Fol the rol, &c.  
And he shot his neighbour's old sow through and through the heart,  
With heigho, the old carrion crow cried caa, caa,  
Fol the rol, &c.

4.

"Wife, go and fetch me some treacle in a spoon;"  
Fol the rol, &c.  
"For our neighbour's old sow is gone into a swoon;  
With heigho, the old carrion crow cried caa, caa,  
Fol the rol, &c.

5.

"Od dang it," cried the tailor, "I don't care a louse,"  
Fol the rol, &c.  
"For we shall have chitterlings, black puddings, and souse;  
With heigho, the old carrion crow cried caa, caa,  
Fol the rol, &c.

6.

Oh, the bells they did ring, and the bells they did toll;  
Fol the rol, &c.  
And the little pigs squeak'd for the old sow's soul;  
With heigho, the old carrion crow cried caa, caa,  
Fol the rol, &c.

We have here the arrow and the bow; the treacle (probably the theriac composition so extolled as a curative); and the satirical finale, which claim for the song a far higher antiquity than the other versions denote; and one of these is of the time of Charles I.

I have heard, in my boyish days, on rural festive occasions in the Isle of Wight, songs quite as ancient, but of which I only retain the tunes and a few words; and others of later date, but old, such as "'Twas on a misty morning, and cloudy was the weather, I met an old man clothed all in leather;" one, the story of a husband journeying from Lancashire to London to be examined by a legal board "to see whether he was a witch or no," beginning, "As I was searching the records Of noblemen, both dukes and lords;" "How Moth the Miller caught his mare;" "Ben Jonson a beggar from Scotland came, leaving his wallet behind him;" "I am Ormond the brave, did you ne'er hear talk of me?" "When William crossed the Bayne water;" "A walking and a talking in the sweet month of May;" "Oil, where have you been to, so charming and young?" (it was, "to London to see the king crowned.") "The Hyde Park Peacock," etc. My aunt, Mrs. Koach of Arreton Manor, remembered the tune to which Tom Moore's "When in death I shall calm recline" was set given to an old popular song she had often heard in her youth. Moore states that he picked up the air in Ireland.

I cannot find that a dialogue between two ravens has appeared in print. It is especially curious, as having its counterpart in the Weald of Kent. In Sussex I have failed to find anything analagous.

First Raven. Mare dead! mare dead!

Second Raven. Where? Where?

First Raven. Down in Quarr Copse. Down in Quarr Copse.

Second Raven. Is she fat? Is she fat?

First Raven. Bare bones. Bare bones.

Second Raven. Let her rot. Let her rot.

I have two versions of that of the Weald of Kent. The one is:

First Raven. Dead sheep! Dead sheep!

Second Raven. Where about? Where about?

First Raven. In the marsh dyke. In the marsh dyke.

Peck his eyes out. Peck his eyes out. Second Raven. May I come? May I come? First Raven. Come a'; come a'. (Come all.)

This I have from Mr. Henry Latter of Harbourne House, near Boar's Isle. The other, given me by the late Mr. Wildish of Eochester (a Wealden man), more closely resembles that of the Isle of Wight, the scene being laid in the marsh (probably Eomney Marsh); and the reply to "Is she fat?" being "All glure; all glure," equivalent to the "Bare bones" of the Isle of Wight version. In Jamieson's Dictionary "glure" is rendered "dirt."

SUPERSTITIONS.

A LOAF baked on Good Friday was put by to serve, with other things, for looseness in calves.

The death of the master or mistress was announced to the bees.

A robin pecking at the window was supposed to foretell a death in the family.

The flight of magpies to the right or to the left, and the number of the birds, foretold good or bad luck, and happy or disastrous events.

Ravens are birds of ill omen; and their presence near dwellings presage death. The acute sense of smell in these birds may attract them to diseased persons. My sister-in-law told me that previous to the death (from fever) of one of her children at Landguard two ravens sat daily in the lime trees near the house, and did not leave until the child was buried.

Rising before the sun on St. Patrick's day, and sowing seed, would make the flowers double.

The key and bible divination to discover a thief has descended to the present generation; and the same with the belief in "cunning men," supposed also to have the power to discover concealed money.

Belief in witches still lingers here and there. A friend writes: "There was a legend of an old woman, who lived about Hale Common or Arreton, for a frolic turning herself into a hare; and when close run by the hounds of Mr. Thatcher of Wackland, made her escape through the keyhole of the door." It was at Wackland a story was told of a witch coming to the door in the form of a black cat, when the cook, who was frying pancakes, threw a spoonful of boiling lard upon it, which caused the cat to run off crying with pain. The reputed witch was afterwards known to have had a great sore on her back.

The belief in supernatural influences at the erection of churches is of very early origin, and it appears to point to the period of transition from paganism to Christianity. That connected with Godshill church is, that when the materials for building were collected in a field below, they were removed, at night, to the elevated spot on which the church now stands. The field from which the building stones were removed is called the Devil's Acre.

Watching the corpse at night was a general custom; usually by a couple of men, who often told of what they had seen or heard of the supernatural.

In Fairies and Night Mares there yet lingers a belief. The former, in one version of the building of Godshill church, are prominent actors; to them are ascribed the circular growths of fungi upon the downs, the fossil echini, etc. The Night Mare not only visits the bed-chamber, but also the stables. On one occasion, noticing that a particular horse was in profuse perspiration, I was told that probably the old hag (hags and witches are usually old) had been riding it in the night. Horse-shoes are everywhere nailed in proximity to stables as a protection against evil influences.

Ladies in white, not of earthly mould, were once supposed to be seen, at certain times, in a long yew and box walk which reached from Landguard to Hook's Hill, towards Shanklin; and one of Miss Johnson's sonnets `[This is not included in the volume of sonnets by Mary F. Johnson, London: Longman & Co. 1810]` is an Invocation to a spirit said to haunt Wroxall Down, upon which are ancient tumuli. Upon the Down of St. Boniface adjoining is a Wishing "Well, a relic of pagan superstitious practices of which so much has been recorded and so much yet survives. Here the popular belief is, that if the well be reached without once looking back, any wish formed while drinking the water will certainly be granted. The story goes that the lads and lasses of the neighbourhood used to resort to the well to deck it with garlands of flowers; and that vessels were wont to lower their topmasts as they passed in view of the sacred spot.

CUSTOMS.

PERAMBULATIONS by children at Shrovetide, called "Shroving," I suppose are now quite extinct. They were almost so, some thirty years since, when, as my brother writes, he only knew of a single instance of the giving of cakes, formerly a common custom; and that was at Wroxall Farm. Cakes were provided at all the farm-houses, and distributed to parties of children who attended in the morning, singing with loud drawling monotony:

A shroven, a shroven, we be come a shroven;  
A piece of bread, a piece of cheese, a piece of your fat bacon,  
Or one or two doughnuts, all of your own maken.

Chorus: A shroven, a shroven; we be come a shroven.  
A shroven, a shroven; we be come a shroven;  
Nice meat in a pie; my mouth, be very dry;  
I wish 6knj was as well a wet; I'd sing the louder for a nut.  

Chorus: A shroven, a shroven; we be come a shroven.

Doughnuts and pancakes appear to have been given formerly; but in later times these more expensive dainties had given place to small, plain, flat cakes; and these, instead of being home-made, were usually ordered in plentiful store of the baker.

There was another song sung about eighty or ninety years since by the children of the towns and larger villages, but on what particular day is not recorded. They went from house to house, and each received a cake (not a Shrovecake) and a little wooden cup of ale. Mr. Crew of Portsmouth, a native of the western part of the island, from whom my brother had the particulars, had been accustomed, when a child, to join the strollers and to sing with them. The song ran thus:—

A sale, a sale in our town;  
The cup is white, and the eal is brown;  
The cup is made from the ashen tree;  
And the eal is brew'd from good barlie.  
Chorus: Cake and eal, cake and eal,

A piece of cake and a cup of eal;  
We'll sing merrily one and all  
For a piece of cake and a cup of eal.

Little maid, little maid, troll the pin,  
Open the door and we'll all vail in `[vail in means to stand in rank while the cake and ale are given to each.]`;  
Give us a cake and some eal that's brown,  
And we don't keer a fig vor the sale in the town.  
Chorus: Cake and eal, &c.

Troll the pin. This is the same as the more common "tirl the pin," which occurs in old ballads; as—

"Then John he arose, and to the door goes, And he tirled, and he tilled at the pin; The lass she took the hint, and to the door she went; And she let her true love in."

Colonel Joseph H. Jolliffe writes: 'Tirling the pin-' is still used in Scotland. I heard a lady in Edinburgh use the expression, when my attention was arrested by a ring over a twisted bar of iron at the door of an old house near Holyrood Palace. By moving the ring up and down the bar, a noise is created to call the inmates to open the door; thus answering the same purpose as a knocker."

Seed-sowing and sheep-shearing had their festivals; but the chief was the home-harvest, when a substantial hot supper was provided for all; and this was followed by beer-drinking, smoking, and singing. The following was the song of the evening, in which all joined:

Here's a health unto our Master,  
The founder of the feast;  
And we pray to God in heaven,  
His soul may be at rest;  
That everything may prosper,  
Whatever he takes in hand,  
For we are all his servants,  
And all at his command.  
So drink, boys, drink, and see that you do not spill;  
For if you do, you shall drink two,  
For it is our Master's will.  
Here's a health unto our Mistress, who brews for us good beer;  
She is an honest woman, and giveth us good cheer;  
For she's a good provider, abroad as well as at home.  
Fill it up to the brim, and toss it off clean,  
For this is our Harvest-home.  
So drink, boys, drink, etc.  

If the entire families of the men-folk did not attend the feast, they were not forgotten. The remnants, ever substantial, were sent to their homes. Home-harvest, or harvest-home, is now a custom of the past. I can boast of having assisted in early life at four; at North Stoneham and Nursling near Southampton; and at Landguard and Apse in the Isle of Wight.

SAYINGS.

WHEN St. Catharine wears a cap,  
Then all the Island wears a hat.  
When the clay beats the sand,  
Then 'tis merry England.  
When the sand beats the clay,  
Then, Old England, well-a-day.  

The moon.

A Zaturday's new, and a Zunday's full;  
Never did no good, and never wul.

A Saturday's moon,  
Once in seven years it comes too soon.

When the oak leaves come before the ash,  
We shall only have a gentle splash;  
But when the ash is before the oak,  
Then England may expect a soak.

A rainbow by night is the shepherd's delight;  
A rainbow in the morning is the shepherd's warning.

Evening red and morning grey,  
Are sure signs of a fine day.

If the ice be strong enough to bear a man before Christmas, it will not bear a goose after.  
*The last two winters have not verified this saying.*

Mares' tails and a mackerel sky,  
Not four and twenty hours dry.  
A mackerel sky and mares' tails  
Make lofty ships carry low sails.

If Candlemas day be fair and bright,  
Winter will have another flight:  
If Candlemas day be clouds and rain,  
Winter is gone and won't come again.

When the wind is in the east  
'Tis good for neither man nor beast.

Magpies. One, sorrow; two, mirth;  
Three, joy; four, a birth.

But for the robin and the wren,  
A spider would overcome a man.

If we here accept the Robin and the Wren as representing insectiverous birds in general, and the Spider as all classes of destructive insects, this old saying is founded upon experience, and should be impressed upon every child in every school and at home.

SPORTS, PASTIMES, AND GAMES.

SOME Sports and Pastimes of remote antiquity have descended to our days, modified happily, but not extinguished. Bull-baiting has left a trace at Brading in the iron ring by which the bull was confined when attacked by the dogs. Cock-fighting has a visible record in a public house between Branston and Hale, called the "Fighting Cocks." This game was universal from the time of the Romans, and probably in that of the Britons. It was until a late day pursued with ardour all over the island. The Isle of Wight cocks have fought at Westminster against those of all England; and when they have been sent to Newport with a load of wheat have been known to fetch more money than the wheat itself. I can find no trace of the atrociously barbarous practice of throwing at cocks at Shrovetide, once common throughout England; nor of burying the live bodies of geese or other birds, and throwing or shooting at them, common near Rochester within the memory of man. Foxes were not indigenous, and are of a very recent introduction. Otters and badgers are almost, if not quite, extinct. Bowling Greens were common. Sir John Oglander speaks of one upon St. George's Down, between Arreton and Newport, which was resorted to by the chief gentry of the island; and one was made for the amusement of Charles I, when confined in Carisbrooke Castle.

The chief Pastime, not yet, I believe, extinct, is of a dramatic kind. It is a performance at Christmas by itinerant companies of lads and young men, called in the Island, Christmas Boys; in Sussex, Mummers; and in Kent, the Seven Champions. It belongs to the class of mediaeval Mysteries and Moralities, if we may infer from the Dramatis Personce, and is probably made up of more than one of the old compositions.

Mr. Henry Slight has published one version, "compiled from and collated with," he states, "several curious ancient black-letter editions." `[Christmas: his Pageant Play or Mysterie of "St. George." Portsmouth and London: 1836.]` The characters are somewhat different from those in the Isle of Wight version, and the language is also somewhat grander; while both are full of anachronisms and inconsistencies. It has Alexander, the Turkish Knight, Agricola, St. George, Galgacus, the King of Egypt, and Judas; while it wants some of the personages which figure in the Isle of Wight play; and particularly that of Beelzebub, which is also wanting in a copy of the latter, sent me by Mr. W. H. Long of Portsmouth, from recollections of it as played in the western parts of the island. Colonel Jolliffe has also sent me the result of his remembrance in the eastern parts, where I heard it when a boy. The words he gives to this character are slightly different and not quite so indicative of antiquity as those of my own recollection, which are:

Here comes I, old Beelzebub;  
Upon my shoulder I carries my club;  
In my hand I carries my pan;  
And don't you think I'm a jolly old man? `[The various versions of this Christmas Play would probably be worth printing. They do not come within the scope of the Dialect Society.]`

On Isle of Wight Games, Colonel Jolliffe writes:

"Our rustic youth play a game of great antiquity, called 'Siege of Troy,' which at Winchester I heard called 'Peg Nine Holes.' It is played by boys making use of pot-shards and pan-tiles for men. When at Muscat, in Arabia, I saw two Arab merchants playing a somewhat similar game. Nearly every stable bin, as far as I can recollect, had a 'Siege of Troy' cut on the lid of it."

"The Roman game of 'Five Stones' is played with a difference, with nine knuckle bones. It is called 'Nine Bones,' and it requires some dexterity in playing."

"The game of Skittles is also altered from nine pins to four, and is called 'Four Corners.'"

"The game of 'Buck, Buck, how many fingers do I hold up?' is common to Hampshire in general; and I believe is so everywhere: a game very similar is popular in Italy. I am pleased with the opportunity of mentioning this game here, because, some time since, I was not a little surprised to find it recorded in *Petronius Arbiter*, with such particulars that the identity is palpable; and the most remarkable feature is the name 'Buck,' which is 'Bucca.' At his celebrated feast Trimalchio, in the plenitude of delight, mounts a favourite boy upon his back, when the sportive companion, suiting action to words, slaps his master's shoulders, and cries 'Bucca, Bucca, quot sunt hic?'"
