At common law, criminal conversation, often abbreviated as crim. con., is a tort arising from adultery. "Conversation" is an old euphemism for sexual intercourse that is obsolete except as part of this term.[1]

entered the House of Commons in 1774 for the constituency of Newport. 
 lost all his offices when the North administration fell in 1782. A supporter of the Lord North government, he was appointed a clerk comptroller of the board of green cloth (Second Clerk Comptroller, 1779; a position in the British Royal Household., responsible for organising royal journeys and assisting in the administration of the Royal Household) in 1777, comptroller of the king's household (1779–82), privy councillor (from 1780) and Governor of the Isle of Wight (1780–82).
 re-entered Parliament as MP for Newtown, Isle of Wight, from 1790 to 1793 (rotten borough then?))
Seymour was forced to become a professional mistress or demimondaine and live off the donations of rich men in order to survive, joining other upper-class women in a similar position in the New Female Coterie.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demimonde
Demimondaine became a synonym for a courtesan or a prostitute who moved in these circles—or for a woman of social standing with the power to thumb her nose at convention and throw herself into the hedonistic nightlife. A woman who made that choice would soon find her social status lost, as she became "déclassée".

 it’s not surprising that legal cases concerning rape, sodomy, bestiality and adultery were eagerly followed and commented upon in the papers. Entrepreneurial businessmen would print cheap mass-produced pamphlets with an account of everything which had happened in a trial, although their reliability is doubtful; sometimes the note-taker in court would get bored or confused and left out bits and misreported others.
 One perennially bestselling source of sexual scandal is of course adultery. It’s a theme which runs throughout Garrow’s Law and indeed throughout the Georgian press. Then as now, the general public would shake their heads in outrage at the news of some extramarital affair and were only too quick to swallow whatever the media told them. In many cases no doubt the Georgian readers did hold genuine moral beliefs against adultery. Yet these stories wouldn’t have sold as half as well as they did if there wasn’t a keen interest in sexual scandal, hiding behind all the public prurience.
From a modern perspective we might assume that when a husband initiated adultery proceedings, it would be against his wife. That wasn’t the case in Georgian England, where the injured husband would bring an action against his wife’s supposed lover. The lover hadn’t committed a criminal offence as such, but if found guilty of adultery (‘criminal conversation’ as it was euphemistically known) he would have to pay the husband compensation, the idea being that he’d damaged the other man’s property (his wife). Because of this, adultery trials took place in the civil courts, particularly in the Court of the King’s Bench.
[Westminster Hall, where the Court of the King’s Bench oversaw criminal conversation suits]
Sir Richard Worsley (1751-1805) was a politician and antiquarian who married 17-year-old Seymour Dorothy Fleming in 1775. Although she brought the considerable sum of £70,000 into the marriage, they were badly suited and the marriage soon fell apart. Lady Worsley was rumoured to have had 27 lovers. She had a child by Maurice George Bisset, an officer of the Hampshire militia and a friend of Sir Richard’s, with whom she then ran off in November 1781.
Although Sir Richard had previously acknowledged the child as his own in order to avoid scandal, after their elopement he was out for revenge, and in 1782 he brought a criminal conversation case against Bisset for £20,000. At first the case looked like a strong one. Lady Worsley’s past history of adultery would tell against her, and there was fairly sound evidence to show that she had lain with Bisset. But as the trial unfolded, shocking revelations brought the prosecution into doubt.
Various witnesses described how Sir Richard didn’t seem to care about Lady Worsleys’ adultery and even encouraged it. The counsel for the prosecution revealed that when various ladies from their neighborhood had warned Sir Richard that he ought to keep his wife in check, he replied that ‘Lady Worsley liked it, and he chose to…oblige her’. Following this, Lord Deerhurst gave evidence that Sir Richard had told him ‘that many young Men had tried her…and that I had his permission to try my chance with her’.
The case was ultimately undone by the revelation that Sir Richard had actually displayed his wife naked to Bisset at the bath-house at Maidstone, shouting ‘Seymour! Seymour! Bisset is looking at you’. Being convinced of the adultery, the jury found for Sir Richard, but obviously they weren’t very impressed with him since they only awarded him 1 shilling in damages. The sensational trial found its way into the press, and you could buy a printed transcription for (ironically) one shilling. Sir Richard Worsley was ever after laughed at as a cuckold.

A beautiful and wealthy heiress, Seymour Dorothy Fleming was one of England’s most eligible bachelorettes. On the 20th September 1775, at the age of 17, she married Sir Richard Worsley. Now known as Lady Worsley, Seymour brought £52,000 to the union which is the equivalent of over £6 million in today’s money.
Lady Worsley was a spirited and independent young woman. She wasn’t afraid to say what she thought and do what she wanted, something that at the time, was not expected of a woman. Wives were expected to do their husband’s bidding and were seen as property in the same way as cattle or land.
In November 1781, Lady Worsley eloped with Captain George Bissett, a friend of her husbands, leaving her 4 month old baby behind. This act of defiance prompted Sir Richard to bring a criminal conversation case (adultery, with one of his officers) for £20,000 against Bissett. Lady Worsley made the courageous decision to support Bissett, publicly humiliating herself and her position in society.
Testimony was provided by a number of Lady Worsley’s 27 lovers and her doctor, William Osborn. He testified that she had suffered from a venereal disease which she had contracted from the Marquess of Graham. This acted as evidence that Bissett had not been alone in committing adultery with Lady Worsley.
Although Sir Richard looked to have a strong case, it was undone by a final piece of evidence. Rather than suppressing their relationship, it was later proven that Sir Richard had displayed his wife naked to George Bissett at the bathhouse in Maidstone encouraging the affair. This evidence destroyed Sir Richard’s suit and the jury awarded him only 1 shilling in damages.
Today, the famous Joshua Reynolds painting of Lady Wolsey hangs in the Cinnamon Drawing Room of Harewood House. The portrait depicts the young Lady Worsley in the milita uniform of her husband.

Sir Richard Worsley inherited Appuldurcombe in 1768. Four years later he met Seymour Fleming, a wealthy heiress with a reputation for being a bit of a wild child, and by 1776 they were married with a son. Unfortunately, Sir Richard was too busy with his duties defending the Isle of Wight from France, Spain and Holland, to pay much attention to his energetic wife, and she sought solace in fashionable society, hanging out with the Duchess of Devonshire and – perhaps – enjoying an affair or two. Richard Sheridan’s School for Scandal (1777) is suggestive of this, insofar as Seymour was apparently the inspiration for naughty Lady Teazle in the play. Either way, pretty standard Georgian fare so far.
Our story takes a turn for the unconventional when one George Bisset arrives on the island in 1780. Worsley quickly befriended this fellow aristo of a similar age, and made him a captain of his militia. With the threat of French invasion looming large, local troops from around the country were ordered to assemble in Kent, and Worsley’s militia, including Bisset and Lady Worsley, moved to the mainland. Bisset and the Worsleys moved into a large house in Maidstone, and soon George and Seymour were sharing more than just polite mealtime conversation. But here’s the thing: it seems Sir Richard was rather excited by this turn of events, and sought to actively encourage it. One famous episode in particular suggests this was indeed the case.
In September 1781, George, Seymour and Sir Richard decided to pay a visit to Maidstone’s segregated bathhouse. After a quick dip, the two men found a window high above the women’s bathing rooms. Sir Richard then called out to his wife, ‘Seymour, Seymour, Bisset is going to get up and look at you!’ He lifted George onto his shoulder, and George spent a few quiet moments watching Seymour and her scandalised servant get dressed.
Shocking goings on such as these would probably have stayed secret if George and Seymour hadn’t then eloped, and titillation turned to public humiliation for poor old Sir Richard. He decided to sue George for a cripplingly massive sum of money, on the grounds that his treacherous captain had ‘damaged’ his wife. George’s defence stated that he couldn’t possibly have damaged the dishonourable Lady Worsley bearing in mind widespread rumours that he was, in fact, her 28th sexual conquest, and furthermore the bathhouse incident proved Richard had in fact deliberately accelerated his own cuckolding. The judge agreed, and Sir Richard was awarded compensation of a single shilling. Details of the trial were covered in minute detail in the press, and an eager readership turned the court report into the first bestseller to emerge from the scandal. Apparently George Washington owned a copy.
A better candidate for the title of the 50 Shades of Grey of its day is the poem Lady Worsley – shunned by society and seeking refuge in progressive, permissive France – commissioned to put forward her side of the story. An Epistle from L-y W-y to S-r R-d W-y seeks to defend her motivations and actions with steamy rhyming couplets written in the first person:
… with B—-t stopt, for he could give
What from thine arms I never could receive.
From him no tiezing titillations came,
He rais’d those passions which he could well tame.
Dissolv’d in thrilling extacy we lay,
Kiss’d till the morn, then curs’d the coming day.
Oh, had you seen me on his breast relin’d.
Lips glu’d to lips, and limbs with limbs entwin’d.
With oft repeated acts of dalliance spent,
My lust quite sated, and my heart content.
As Hallie Rubenhold’s Lady Worsley’s Whim – a brilliant book-length account of the affair, published in 2008 – puts it, the poem ‘hit precisely the right note to raise a chorus of public outrage … letters began streaming into the offices of the Morning Post and the Morning Herald … the pamphlet continued to sell by the bundle. It was available to buy “at every bookseller in London and all of the principle ones in every city and town in England”. In the spring of 1782, anyone possessing the faintest grasp of literacy, from the shop clerk to the gentleman of leisure, was burying their nose between the indecent pages of Lady Worsley’s Epistle.’

Outside Parliament, the trial's sex scandal of Sir Richard Worsley, the man who had cuckolding himself by encouraging his friend George Bisset to pursue his wife, caught the public imagination like no other. It was covered in immense details in the newspapers and cartoons about it were published. At the trial was a court reporter who recorded the testimonies of the trial. Within two days The Trial with the Whole of the Evidence between the Right Hon. Sir Richard Worsley, Bart. And George Maurice Bisset Esq, Defendant, for Criminal Conversation with the Plaintiff's Wife – Price, 1 shilling was published in London. This became an international best-seller, even George Washington owned a copy.
This was followed by anonymous, often mocking publications of the Worsley's lives. These included The Genuine Anecdotes and Amorous Adventures of Sir Richard Easy and Lady Wagtail and The Memoirs of Sir Finical Whimsy and His Lady. There were even erotic poems published, including The Whim!!! Or the Maidstone Bath and Variety, or Which is the Man?, about Lady Worsley's love life.
In April 1782, with the Separation from Bed and Board divorce case underway, An Epistle from Lady W-y to Sir R-d W-y was published. This erotic poem was the Fifty Shades of Grey of its day, in which her thoughts and feelings were expressed by a hired professional writer in 16 pages of scandalously sexual rhyming couplets.
Although society was outraged by its content, which attempted to justify the actions of a woman who left her husband and children, it sold outrageously well. Dr Samuel Johnson, author of the dictionary, described it with the words, it is without exception the best written poem that has made its appearance these many years. Sir Richard wrote a poem in response, The Answer of Sir R-d W-y to the Epistle of Lady W-y, however this was only sold in three bookshops in London.
Lord Worsley was buried in All Saints Church in Godshill, where in the picture-perfect church he was buried within a 30-ton sarcophagus with lion's feet. This vast monument was considered such an annoying nuisance that in 1905 it was hidden behind the church organ.
In 1774, Sir Richard had erected a 70-foot obelisk, ostensibly in honour of Sir Robert Worsley, but as a celebration of his own prestige. This was struck by lightning in 1831 and is now all-but demolished. His vineyards near Ventnor failed and his home, Appuldurcombe House, has been a roofless shell since the Second World War, although English Heritage have recently restored part of it.
Perhaps Sir Richard's longest lasting legacy was his workhouse. The Isle of Wight House of Industry became the template for other workhouses nationwide following the 1834 Poor Law Amendment Act, bringing untold pain and misery to millions until the workhouses were finally closed in 1929.

Wight past present Mudie 1840
in January 1778 the tower was shattered by lightning. The Rev. Daniel Walsh, then vicar
of Godshill, communicated at the time a very circumstantial account to Sir Richard Worsley, from which we make the following extract. “We had here, on Monday last, about nine in the morning, very severe lightning, with two of the loudest claps of thunder I ever heard. There was a sensible interval between the first flash of lightning and its thunder. The second flash of lightning, and clap of thunder, seemed to be at the same instant. My house rocked as if it were tumbling down, and at first I thought of the effects of an earthquake. I concluded that the cloud would burst, and be attended with fatal consequences. It first made its appearance against the old tower; and from thence its zig-zag, confused, and various directions, were so perplexed that they
cannot be followed by any continued description. It seems to have commenced its rage near the middle of the wall, about four feet below the dial-plate of the clock, where it
tore off large pieces of massive stone, and loosened many others, but did not penetrate quite through there; some of it must have entered by the spindle in the centre of the dial plate, as it brake the clock-case, liquified the upper part of the pendulum ,disturbed the works of the clock, and broke
the piece of iron that regulates the striking.
