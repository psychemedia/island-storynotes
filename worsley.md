CRIM. CON. INTELLIGENCE.

Thursday afternoon the celebrated cause, between Sir Richard Worsley, Bart, plaintiff, and Captain Maurice George Blisset, of the Hampshire militia, defendant, was tried in the Court of King's Bench, before Lord Justice Mansfield and a special Jury, The plaintiff's case, opened by the Attorney-General, stated that Mr. Blisset, in violation of every law of hospitality and friendship, had seduced the wife of Sir Richard from her conjugal duties, on the 19th of November last, and now lived with her in open adultery. In proof of this he called several of Sir Richard Worsley's domestics, to prove the intimacy that subsisted between the parties; and the absence of Lady Worsley from Sir Richard's lodgings' at Lewes, till four o'clock one morning, when she and the Captain spent the evening together at another house, from whence they went afterwards to the Captain's lodgings, and thence took flight in a chaise and four for town, where arriving, the fond pair took up their abode at the Royal Hotel, Pal! Mail, for near a week, cohabiting together as man and wife. From hence Lady Worsley sent a message to Sir Richard, by Lord Deerhurst, informing him, that *"She Would never live with him any more!"*— Further evidence (in order to aggravate the damages) was called, to ascertain the ample fortune of the defendant, which was proved by his steward to be about 800l. per annum. Here the counsel for the prosecution rested the cause.

Mr. Bearcroft, as leading advocate for the defendant, said he was convinced that a verdict must be given for the plaintiff; and therefore the quantum of damages annexed to that verdict, was the only point on which he should trouble the court. He then stated, that in the present instance, as there was no seduction proved on the part of the plaintiff, nor any person of any description called in support of the character of the lady previous to this transaction, it was evident that his learned brethren knew they trod on tender ground; but this he should not leave to be inferred from their silence; but prove by the strongest evidence, that they could not call a single acquaintance of the family, who must not have given testimony of her *notorious infamy*. In this, he said, he was sorry to add, that he should likewise produce in evidence, that if Sir Richard Worsley was not an accessory to his own dishonour, he did not at least seem very anxious to prevent it; he trusted therefore, that if he made all this appear, of which he had not the smallest doubt, and that though a verdict should be given against his client as a matter of course, yet it ought to be unaccompanied by those immense damages that were the object of the present prosecution, but which the notorious character of the lady under consideration, he trusted would justly and legally defeat.

Lord Deerhurst was now called. On being asked, whether he thought the conduct of Lady Worsley such as became a lady of conjugal virtue? said, *certainly not*. His Lordship then stared some circumstances that came immediately under his own his knowledge, such as his being caught in her dressing-room, adjoining her bed chamber, by Sir Richard, at four o'clock in the morning, in the Isle of Wight; his meeting her on the read, as she went, at Kingston and Godalmin, in her way to Portsmouth alone, and sleeping in the same house. On being asked, whether in the *same bed?* his Lordship applied to the Judge, by whom he was justified in refusing to answer this question. Being interrogated whether he had not once had some extraordinary conversation with Sir Richard about her? he replied, that one morning, on Lady Worsley's passing the window, Sir Richard said to him, "There, Deehurst, she goes; many young men have tempted her in vain, I believe; but you are welcome to try whether you can succeed with her." But this, his Lordship said, be conceived to be uttered rather jocosely than otherwise.

Lord Peterborough spoke to the levity, and infidelity of Lady W.s conduct, as it appeared him; as did a Mr. Bouchier Smith. The Marquis of Graham was examined to the same points, and further pressed to declare whether he had not some *particular reason* for supposing Lady W. being ill during his excursion to the Isle of Wight, but his Lordship very modestly and sensibly avoided replying to the question.

The Hon. Charles Wyndham, in addition to what the other gallants had stated, proved, that her Ladyship had taken her wedding gold ring from her finger, and put it upon his, some little time before he went abroad.

Dr. Osborne was called upon to prove her Ladyship's indisposition: he said, that concerning himself, and not obliged to reveal a professional secret, he had written to Lady W. and desired to know whether she had any objection to his keeping the matter secret; to which he received an answer, insisting on his declaring it, which he therefore now did, in as delicate a manner as possible.

Two affidavits were also read, of a woman who keeps the Cold Bath, at Maidstone, that one day in September last, Lady W. came there to bathe, accompanied by Sir Richard and Captain Blisset; that soon after, she saw the latter looking in at the window, which he could not have reached without help; and that heard Sir Richard call out to Lady W. *"Seymour, Blisset is looking at you."* That when Lady Worsley was dressed and gone out, she found the two gentlemen; that they all departed together laughing, and seemingly in perfect good humour with each other.

Here the evidence was rested for the defendant. Lord Mansfield then up the whole, and explained it as law, that where an husband connived the incontinence of his wife, and was privy to her adultery, no action did lie. The Jury however found the fact according to proof, but reduced the damages, which the Baronet laid at *Twenty Thousand Pounds*, and gave their verdict tor only ONE SHILLING.

Leicester Journal - Saturday 02 March 1782

TO DO

Yesterday was tried before the Right Hon. Earl Mansfield, a cause wherein Sir Richard Worley, Bart. was plantiff, and--------Bisset Esq. defendant. The action was brought to recover damages against the defendant, for seducing the wife of the plaintiff, and for committing the foul crime of adultery with her, thereby depriving Sir Richard of those comforts a husband is entitled to expect, and which it was understood he would have enjoyed, had not the defendant, perpetrated the crime before mentioned.

The Attorney General, as counsel for the plaintiff, opened the cause, stating a variety of matter for the consideration of the jury, but particularly the ingratitude of the defendant, who, as the learned counsel observed, had debauched the wife of his friend, a gentleman to whose liberality and regard, he owed his commission as Captain in the Hants regiment of Militia, and who had not only received him into his family, with all the warmth of generous friendship, but had, upon every occasion, shewn him the most disinterested marks of esteem and attention. After a very pointed and elegant exordium by Mr. Attorney General, several witnesses were called to prove Lady Worley's elopement some time ago from Lewes, in Sussex, with the defendant; and the master of the Royal Hotel, in Pall-Mall, together with the waiter, and one of the chambermaids belonging to that house, were examined, who declared that the fugitives had arrived there in a post-chaise in the night, and that they had been several hours in bed together, previous to their departure. Mr. Bearcroft, as counsel for the defendant, willing to save the court unnecessary trouble, frankly acknowledged that he had no evidence to controvert the fact, but in a very able speech contended, on the part of his client, that the plaintiff was not entitled to exemplary damages, as he had not only acquiesced in the incontinence of his Lady, but in fact encouraged it. So extraordinary and unexpected a defence naturally drew the attention of the Court, particularly on Lord Mansfield's observing, that where the husband is proved to have been privy to the prostitution of his wife, he cannot be entitled to the verdict of his country.------To substantiate the defence made by the learned Counsel on the part of the defendant, and also to shew the profligate conduct of the Lady, several of the strictibly men of the ton were examined, all of whom had at different times, as was generally credited, been criminally acquainted with her Ladyship. The strict rules of justice necessary to be complied with on these occasions, reduced these right honourable gallants to a very awkward situation. They were supoened to declare themselves guilty of adultery, and to acknowledge they had received favours from a Lady, which as men of honour and delicacy they were bound to conceal.

Lord Deerhurst was first called. He felt the disagreeable situation he stood in, and appealed to the learned Judge for his direction how to act. Lord Mansfield told him, he was bound not only to tell the truth, but the whole truth. Lord Deerhurst then declared that he had been on a visit to Sir R. Worsley's house on the Isle of Wight, and that in a conversation with Sir Richard, the plaintiff observed, that Lady Worsley had been often tempted by young men of fashion, but in vain; at the same time saying----" If you like to try her Ladyship do it."----Again, Lord Deerhurst said, that he had the fortitude to visit Lady Worsley's chamber about 4 o'clock one morning, but that as the mischief would have it Sir Richard caught him there, and immediately put the important question to him----" Deerhurst, what brought you here?" His Lordship immediately answered, my dear friend, I have a strange custom of walking in my sleep---This joke finished the matter, and the parties retired in great good humour. Lord Deerhurst was then asked, how long he remained at the house after this unluckly discovery. He said about four days, to the best of his recollection, and that, during the time, he had made an appointment with the Lady, who met him in consequence at a village some miles from Southampton, unattended, and where he remained with her twenty-four hours. On counsel asking his Lordship if he had any particular connexion with her Ladyship during that time, an amiable blush of maiden modesty dyed his countenance. The gallant youth immediately appealed to the learned Judge, and begged to know if he was obliged to answer that question---Lord Mansfield said "by no means." The opinion of the audience, however, was nem. con. and here this witness closed his evidence.

Lord Peterborough was next examined; his figure impressed on the minds of the Jury a great probability of his being successful in the Lady's good opinion. As Quitam says in the farce, " Had he been seen " knocking at the street door, it would have been " sufficient." His Lordship, however, was reserved in his evidence, and said little more than that he had known the Lady.
The Marquis of Graham was the third evidence. In the course of which he spoke with uncommon modesty; we hope this truth is no libel on a man of fashion---the fact is, he spoke very feelingly on the the occasion, and some saucy auditors were ill-natured enough to say it was not surprizing, as his Lordship had received favours from the Lady that had made a lasting impression.

The Hon. Mr. Windham was next sworn. He acknowledged to have visited Lady Worley. Counsel then asked him if he had not received a ring from her Ladyship as a present; he said he had---was it a wedding-ring; ---he could not tell that---was it a plain ring? yes.---Her Ladyship's ring closed this evidence.

Another witness was brought to prove the following very extraordinary whimsey which entered Sir Richard's head one day at the bath at Maidstone, in Kent. Lady Worley, it seems, was bathing, during which time the plantiff and defendant were in converse on the out-side of the building. Sir Richard informed the defendant, that Lady Worley was beyond all doubt the finest proportioned woman in Europe; and in case he wished to be convinced of the fact, he would assist the defendant in getting up to an aperture or window, thro' which he might see her, like Diana bathing with her Nymphs. The soldier immediately mounted on Sir Richard's shoulders, and by that means had an opportunity of seeing the amiable fair one in a state somewhat similar to Eve before her fall.----The attendant, on seeing Mars peep through the hole, cried out in a very audible voice, " Lord, Madam, there's the Captain " looking !----- --for shame, Sir---Lord,---Madam " what shall we do with the impudent man?"--Her Ladyship did not appear to be so agitated as Betty, but dressed herself with great composure, and then joined Sir Richard and the Captain, who were waiting for her Ladyship. The parties met with infinite good humour and returned home laughing heartily at the whim.

A Doctor was afterwards sworn. This evidence proved, that he had attended her Ladyship in a situation too indelicate to mention in a public paper. He also declared, that immediately after he had received the supoena to appear and give evidence on the tryal then before the Court, he waited on her Ladyship, and requested she would not be displeased at his attending, as he should be obliged to tell all he knew. Upon which her Ladyship immediately answered, "Indeed Sir, you have my permission most sincerely: Nay more, I request you will make a point of attending, and declare every thing you know of me." This declaration discovered an uncommon affection for her present gallant, as it plainly meant---criminate me, as by that means you will save my lover from the effects of a heavy verdict. Some other evidences were brought, all of whom established one fact beyond the possibility of a doubt, viz. that the Lady was slighty before her present connexion. We are sorry to add, that the most of the auditors were highly displeased with the conduct of the plaintiff, who seemed to have lost a due sense of his own rank, and the dignity of manhood.

After the several witnesses had closed their evidence, the learned and upright Chief summed up the whole, with the utmost precision and impartiality. The Jurors then retired, and after some consideration, brought in a verdict for the plaintiff, to the damage of One Shilling only.

THE Declaration stated, that the Defendant, on the 19th day of November, 1781, and on divers other days and times, between 
wndaynnd she 24th of the fame month, at Westminster, in the county of Middlesex, with 

force and arms, made an assault on Seymour, the Wife of the Plaintiff, and then and there debauched, deflowered, lay with, and carnally knew her, the said Seymour, to the Plaintiff's damage of 20,000l. 

To this declaration the Defendant pleaded not guilty, and thereupon issue was joined, 
Counsel for the Plaintiff. Counsel for the Defendant, 
Mr. Attorney General, Mr. Bearcroft, 
Mr. Lee, Mr. Ho worth, 
Mr. D U N N I N G . M r. P E C H E L L « 
Mr. Erskine. 
ON the opening of Mr. Attorney General, it appeared that the Plaintiff lives at Apuldur- comb, in the Isle of Wight, and that he is worth about 5000I. a year; that Lady Worsley is the Daughter of Sir John Fleming, who is dead, and with whom Sir Richard had a fortune of about 70,000k or upwards; that her Mother was married to Mr. Lasceiles, of Yorkshire, and her Sifter to Lord Harrington. The Plaintiff and ihe were married on the 15th of September, 1775; and they have issue of the marriage two children, a ion and a daughter; the first, born within a year or two after their marriage; and the latter, in August last.

That the Defendant was an officer in the Hampshire militia, of which the Plaintiff is Colonel, and that he had only been acquainted with him from the end of February, or the beginning of March, 1781; that their acquaintance commenced in consequence of a bur- gage-tenure Mr. Bidet was possessed of in the 


Isle of Wight, which, added to an estate worth about 800L a year in Somersetshire, makes his income about 500L a year, and which Sir Richard, for parliamentary convenience, wanted to purchase; that, in consequence of letters having passed between them on that occasion, their first personal interview was by the means of Mr. Clarke, the receiver of Mr. Bisset's rents; and that, soon after their acquaintance. Sir Richard gave him a commission in his regiment. 
The greatest intimacy subsisted between them; the Plaintiff had a house at Maidstone, in Kent, where the Defendant used to visit whilst in camp at Coxheath. When the camp broke up, they came to Lewes, where Sir Richard had a house, and Mr. Bisset lodgings; and the firmest attachment subsisted between them, till the unhappy event took place, which, is the subject of this action.

In about ten minutes, or a quarter of an hour after that, I heard a noise in Mr. Bissett's room, of throwing up the fall). I got out of bed, and went to his room to fee if he wanted any thing.

i ' • 

MR. 

( >9 ) 

MR. BBARCR0FT, in answer to this evidence, did not attempt to make any defence in controvertion of the charge exhibited against the Defendant, but was very ready to admit, that the Plaintiff was intitled to a verdict. The only question which then remained, was upon the subject of damages; in mitigation of which only he would defend his client; and did not doubt to prove, to the satisfaction of the Jury, that Sir Richard not only acquiesced under repeated adts of his own dishonour with various persons, but even excited and encouraged it : On which 
Lord Mansfield laid, If a Plaintiff encourages, or is privy to, or consenting at all, or contributing to the debauchery of his Wife, or joins in it, he ought not to recover a verdict. 
Mr. Bear croft then Rated, That he could not only prove this to be the fact, but that he should prove by the Affidavits of the Woman who attended the Bath at Maidstone, that the Plaintiff there had absolutely raised the Defendant upon his (boulders to view his naked Wife while bathing, and at the fame time called to her, saying, Seymour! Seymour! Bisset is looking at you; and that (he, on coming out after (he had dressed herself, joined the Gentlemen; and they all went off together in a hearty laugh at the transaction which had passed. The Bathing- woman was ill, and could not attend the trial herself to give evidence of this fact; but that it had been agreed between the parties, that the Attornies on each side 

should go down to the place for the purpose of taking the Affidavits, and in order to view the situation; which they had done, and which affidavits would be read.

That the Defendant could not possibly be the Father of the Child born in August last, as his first acquaintance with the Plaintiff commenced only in March 5 fo that he had not bastardized the Plaintiff's issue.

He wondered why they had not called some persons belonging to, or about the family, in order to prove how the parties lived together; a circumstance very material in a case like this: They had only called one person belonging to the family; that was the Butler, who had lived in the house but one day, and who, of course, could not speak to that point.

That the licentious conduct of Lady Worsley was fo notorious, that it had been the subject of common conversation : and that many Ladies of Distinction in the Isle of Wight and elsewhere had frequently remonstrated with Sir Richard on that subject, and told him, that if he did not attempt to restrain her conduct, her character would be ruined and destroyed : that the answer Sir Richard made was, that Lady Worsley liked it, and he chose to doit to oblige her; upon which a very sensible Lady, who had frequently remonstrated with him on the fub- je£t, replied, “ If this is the case, God help you ! 
you are the most contented - Husband 
I ever knew :5' and that from, the Lady's many prior connections, the idea of seduction by the present Defendant was totally done away.

The End of the Evidence for the Defendants 

Mr. J. FAR RER, Attorney for the Plaintiff, sworn on behalf of the Plaintiff. 
Examined by Mr. Attorney-General.

Q. How many feet high may it be?— About four feet. 

Mr. Bearcroft. Where is the seat?— On the outside of the Bath.

Mr. Attorney-General made a short reply upon the subject of Damages and having, in commenting on Lord Deerhurst's Evidence, mistook him in that part where his Lordship says he went to Southampton with Lady Worsley, he rose to explain it, and said that he remained at Southampton with her twenty-four hours, and then returned; and that she staid three or four days.


LORD MANSFIELD. 
Gentlemen of the JURY, 
THERE arises upon this evidence a serious question for your consideration.- — -The nature of the a&ion is such, that the Defendant cannot confess a Verdict because this is between the Husband and Wife and the Adulterer; and further proceedings may be had : therefore the Verdict you give mu ft be out of the truth and justice of the case, and the justice of the Evidence.

Now, the single question is, Whether Sir Richard has not been privy to the prostitution of his Wife, assenting to, encouraging and exciting even this Defendant? And, if he is fo, upon your opinion of the Evidence, he ought not to recover in this Action— If he is not, why then the only question that remains, is upon the subject of Damages; upon which I will not say a word to you. You are the best judges of that.

This Woman, for three or four years, has , been prostituted with a variety of people; that is extremely clear. A stronger instance than the Doctors appearance this day, and what he has said, need not have been brought.— In the year 1779 Lord Deerhurst knew Lady Worsley • 

she was very profligate, and no step was taken by Sir Richard to prevent her: he continued in the Me of Wight ten days, and he has mentioned a conversation that passed between him and Sir Richard, which ought to be laid out of the case, because it seems to be ironical : a That iC many young men had tried her, without success; and that he might take his chance with her.” But he fays, once the Plaintiff found him in Lady Worsley's dressing-room at four o'clock in the morning; and he only fays to him, "Deerhurst, how came you here? And there is no further explanation or examination between them. Is it not extraordinary to find a Gentleman in his Lady's dressing-room at four o'clock in the morning, and nothing further said? All is well; they are all good company the next morning; and fame few days afterwards Lady Worsley is going to Southampton. At the fame time Sir Richard goes eight miles with her, and leaves Lord Deerhurst to go on with her to Southampton : he goes on with her to Southampton; he flays there twenty-four hours, and she stays three or four days : — yet there is no appear nee of Jealousy in the Hu/band ! ! This evidence deserves your consideration.

Another piece of evidence, is that of the Woman at the Bath at Maidstone; she swears, she believes it was impossible for Mr. Bissett to have got up the height of the balcony, to look into the Bath, unless he had flood upon Sir Richard's shoulders: but this is matter of belief; and they have called the Attorney, and you have heard his evidence : he went down there to take the Affidavits : he fays he got up with a great deal of ease, and without assistance; that he got up first on an arm-chair which flood on the outside of the Bath, and then it was only four feet above him; fo that, if he had not flood upon Sir Richard's shoulders, he might easily have pulled him down if he pleased; instead of which he only taps at the door, and fays, Seymour! Seymour! Bissett is looking at you. And when she is dressed and comes out, she joins them, and they are all jolly and merry, and laughing, and go away together.

This is the evidence which they have given; and if upon that evidence you think the Huf- band was privy to, consenting, and encouraging this debauchery, he ought not to have your Verdict; but if you think he. is intitled to your Verdict, then the only point for your consideration is, What Damages you will give. — You will consider of your Verdict, and give what Damages you think proper.

The Jury went out of court, and after debating near an hour, returned with a Verdict for the Plaintiff, giving him only One shilling Damages. 

THE END.

At common law, criminal conversation, often abbreviated as crim. con., is a tort arising from adultery. "Conversation" is an old euphemism for sexual intercourse that is obsolete except as part of this term.[1]

 it's not surprising that legal cases concerning rape, sodomy, bestiality and adultery were eagerly followed and commented upon in the papers. Entrepreneurial businessmen would print cheap mass-produced pamphlets with an account of everything which had happened in a trial, although their reliability is doubtful; sometimes the note-taker in court would get bored or confused and left out bits and misreported others.
 One perennially bestselling source of sexual scandal is of course adultery. It's a theme which runs throughout Garrow's Law and indeed throughout the Georgian press. Then as now, the general public would shake their heads in outrage at the news of some extramarital affair and were only too quick to swallow whatever the media told them. In many cases no doubt the Georgian readers did hold genuine moral beliefs against adultery. Yet these stories wouldn't have sold as half as well as they did if there wasn't a keen interest in sexual scandal, hiding behind all the public prurience.
From a modern perspective we might assume that when a husband initiated adultery proceedings, it would be against his wife. That wasn't the case in Georgian England, where the injured husband would bring an action against his wife's supposed lover. The lover hadn't committed a criminal offence as such, but if found guilty of adultery ('criminal conversation' as it was euphemistically known) he would have to pay the husband compensation, the idea being that he'd damaged the other man's property (his wife). Because of this, adultery trials took place in the civil courts, particularly in the Court of the King's Bench.
[Westminster Hall, where the Court of the King's Bench oversaw criminal conversation suits]
Sir Richard Worsley (1751-1805) was a politician and antiquarian who married 17-year-old Seymour Dorothy Fleming in 1775. Although she brought the considerable sum of £70,000 into the marriage, they were badly suited and the marriage soon fell apart. Lady Worsley was rumoured to have had 27 lovers. She had a child by Maurice George Bisset, an officer of the Hampshire militia and a friend of Sir Richard's, with whom she then ran off in November 1781.
Although Sir Richard had previously acknowledged the child as his own in order to avoid scandal, after their elopement he was out for revenge, and in 1782 he brought a criminal conversation case against Bisset for £20,000. At first the case looked like a strong one. Lady Worsley's past history of adultery would tell against her, and there was fairly sound evidence to show that she had lain with Bisset. But as the trial unfolded, shocking revelations brought the prosecution into doubt.
Various witnesses described how Sir Richard didn't seem to care about Lady Worsleys' adultery and even encouraged it. The counsel for the prosecution revealed that when various ladies from their neighborhood had warned Sir Richard that he ought to keep his wife in check, he replied that 'Lady Worsley liked it, and he chose to…oblige her'. Following this, Lord Deerhurst gave evidence that Sir Richard had told him 'that many young Men had tried her…and that I had his permission to try my chance with her'.
The case was ultimately undone by the revelation that Sir Richard had actually displayed his wife naked to Bisset at the bath-house at Maidstone, shouting 'Seymour! Seymour! Bisset is looking at you'. Being convinced of the adultery, the jury found for Sir Richard, but obviously they weren't very impressed with him since they only awarded him 1 shilling in damages. The sensational trial found its way into the press, and you could buy a printed transcription for (ironically) one shilling. Sir Richard Worsley was ever after laughed at as a cuckold.

https://harewood.org/about/blog/notes/the-life-of-lady-worsley/
A beautiful and wealthy heiress, Seymour Dorothy Fleming was one of England's most eligible bachelorettes. On the 20th September 1775, at the age of 17, she married Sir Richard Worsley. Now known as Lady Worsley, Seymour brought £52,000 to the union which is the equivalent of over £6 million in today's money.
Lady Worsley was a spirited and independent young woman. She wasn't afraid to say what she thought and do what she wanted, something that at the time, was not expected of a woman. Wives were expected to do their husband's bidding and were seen as property in the same way as cattle or land.
In November 1781, Lady Worsley eloped with Captain George Bissett, a friend of her husbands, leaving her 4 month old baby behind. This act of defiance prompted Sir Richard to bring a criminal conversation case (adultery, with one of his officers) for £20,000 against Bissett. Lady Worsley made the courageous decision to support Bissett, publicly humiliating herself and her position in society.
Testimony was provided by a number of Lady Worsley's 27 lovers and her doctor, William Osborn. He testified that she had suffered from a venereal disease which she had contracted from the Marquess of Graham. This acted as evidence that Bissett had not been alone in committing adultery with Lady Worsley.
Although Sir Richard looked to have a strong case, it was undone by a final piece of evidence. Rather than suppressing their relationship, it was later proven that Sir Richard had displayed his wife naked to George Bissett at the bathhouse in Maidstone encouraging the affair. This evidence destroyed Sir Richard's suit and the jury awarded him only 1 shilling in damages.
Today, the famous Joshua Reynolds painting of Lady Wolsey hangs in the Cinnamon Drawing Room of Harewood House. The portrait depicts the young Lady Worsley in the milita uniform of her husband.

Sir Richard Worsley inherited Appuldurcombe in 1768. Four years later he met Seymour Fleming, a wealthy heiress with a reputation for being a bit of a wild child, and by 1776 they were married with a son. Unfortunately, Sir Richard was too busy with his duties defending the Isle of Wight from France, Spain and Holland, to pay much attention to his energetic wife, and she sought solace in fashionable society, hanging out with the Duchess of Devonshire and – perhaps – enjoying an affair or two. Richard Sheridan's School for Scandal (1777) is suggestive of this, insofar as Seymour was apparently the inspiration for naughty Lady Teazle in the play. Either way, pretty standard Georgian fare so far.
Our story takes a turn for the unconventional when one George Bisset arrives on the island in 1780. Worsley quickly befriended this fellow aristo of a similar age, and made him a captain of his militia. With the threat of French invasion looming large, local troops from around the country were ordered to assemble in Kent, and Worsley's militia, including Bisset and Lady Worsley, moved to the mainland. Bisset and the Worsleys moved into a large house in Maidstone, and soon George and Seymour were sharing more than just polite mealtime conversation. But here's the thing: it seems Sir Richard was rather excited by this turn of events, and sought to actively encourage it. One famous episode in particular suggests this was indeed the case.
In September 1781, George, Seymour and Sir Richard decided to pay a visit to Maidstone's segregated bathhouse. After a quick dip, the two men found a window high above the women's bathing rooms. Sir Richard then called out to his wife, 'Seymour, Seymour, Bisset is going to get up and look at you!' He lifted George onto his shoulder, and George spent a few quiet moments watching Seymour and her scandalised servant get dressed.
Shocking goings on such as these would probably have stayed secret if George and Seymour hadn't then eloped, and titillation turned to public humiliation for poor old Sir Richard. He decided to sue George for a cripplingly massive sum of money, on the grounds that his treacherous captain had 'damaged' his wife. George's defence stated that he couldn't possibly have damaged the dishonourable Lady Worsley bearing in mind widespread rumours that he was, in fact, her 28th sexual conquest, and furthermore the bathhouse incident proved Richard had in fact deliberately accelerated his own cuckolding. The judge agreed, and Sir Richard was awarded compensation of a single shilling. Details of the trial were covered in minute detail in the press, and an eager readership turned the court report into the first bestseller to emerge from the scandal. Apparently George Washington owned a copy.
A better candidate for the title of the 50 Shades of Grey of its day is the poem Lady Worsley – shunned by society and seeking refuge in progressive, permissive France – commissioned to put forward her side of the story. An Epistle from L-y W-y to S-r R-d W-y seeks to defend her motivations and actions with steamy rhyming couplets written in the first person:
… with B—-t stopt, for he could give
What from thine arms I never could receive.
From him no tiezing titillations came,
He rais'd those passions which he could well tame.
Dissolv'd in thrilling extacy we lay,
Kiss'd till the morn, then curs'd the coming day.
Oh, had you seen me on his breast relin'd.
Lips glu'd to lips, and limbs with limbs entwin'd.
With oft repeated acts of dalliance spent,
My lust quite sated, and my heart content.
As Hallie Rubenhold's Lady Worsley's Whim – a brilliant book-length account of the affair, published in 2008 – puts it, the poem 'hit precisely the right note to raise a chorus of public outrage … letters began streaming into the offices of the Morning Post and the Morning Herald … the pamphlet continued to sell by the bundle. It was available to buy "at every bookseller in London and all of the principle ones in every city and town in England". In the spring of 1782, anyone possessing the faintest grasp of literacy, from the shop clerk to the gentleman of leisure, was burying their nose between the indecent pages of Lady Worsley's Epistle.'

Outside Parliament, the trial's sex scandal of Sir Richard Worsley, the man who had cuckolding himself by encouraging his friend George Bisset to pursue his wife, caught the public imagination like no other. It was covered in immense details in the newspapers and cartoons about it were published. At the trial was a court reporter who recorded the testimonies of the trial. Within two days The Trial with the Whole of the Evidence between the Right Hon. Sir Richard Worsley, Bart. And George Maurice Bisset Esq, Defendant, for Criminal Conversation with the Plaintiff's Wife – Price, 1 shilling was published in London. This became an international best-seller, even George Washington owned a copy.

This was followed by anonymous, often mocking publications of the Worsley's lives. These included The Genuine Anecdotes and Amorous Adventures of Sir Richard Easy and Lady Wagtail and The Memoirs of Sir Finical Whimsy and His Lady. There were even erotic poems published, including The Whim!!! Or the Maidstone Bath and Variety, or Which is the Man?, about Lady Worsley's love life.
In April 1782, with the Separation from Bed and Board divorce case underway, An Epistle from Lady W-y to Sir R-d W-y was published. This erotic poem was the Fifty Shades of Grey of its day, in which her thoughts and feelings were expressed by a hired professional writer in 16 pages of scandalously sexual rhyming couplets.
Although society was outraged by its content, which attempted to justify the actions of a woman who left her husband and children, it sold outrageously well. Dr Samuel Johnson, author of the dictionary, described it with the words, it is without exception the best written poem that has made its appearance these many years. Sir Richard wrote a poem in response, The Answer of Sir R-d W-y to the Epistle of Lady W-y, however this was only sold in three bookshops in London.
Lord Worsley was buried in All Saints Church in Godshill, where in the picture-perfect church he was buried within a 30-ton sarcophagus with lion's feet. This vast monument was considered such an annoying nuisance that in 1905 it was hidden behind the church organ.
In 1774, Sir Richard had erected a 70-foot obelisk, ostensibly in honour of Sir Robert Worsley, but as a celebration of his own prestige. This was struck by lightning in 1831 and is now all-but demolished. His vineyards near Ventnor failed and his home, Appuldurcombe House, has been a roofless shell since the Second World War, although English Heritage have recently restored part of it.
Perhaps Sir Richard's longest lasting legacy was his workhouse. The Isle of Wight House of Industry became the template for other workhouses nationwide following the 1834 Poor Law Amendment Act, bringing untold pain and misery to millions until the workhouses were finally closed in 1929.

Wight past present Mudie 1840
in January 1778 the tower was shattered by lightning. The Rev. Daniel Walsh, then vicar
of Godshill, communicated at the time a very circumstantial account to Sir Richard Worsley, from which we make the following extract. "We had here, on Monday last, about nine in the morning, very severe lightning, with two of the loudest claps of thunder I ever heard. There was a sensible interval between the first flash of lightning and its thunder. The second flash of lightning, and clap of thunder, seemed to be at the same instant. My house rocked as if it were tumbling down, and at first I thought of the effects of an earthquake. I concluded that the cloud would burst, and be attended with fatal consequences. It first made its appearance against the old tower; and from thence its zig-zag, confused, and various directions, were so perplexed that they
cannot be followed by any continued description. It seems to have commenced its rage near the middle of the wall, about four feet below the dial-plate of the clock, where it
tore off large pieces of massive stone, and loosened many others, but did not penetrate quite through there; some of it must have entered by the spindle in the centre of the dial plate, as it brake the clock-case, liquified the upper part of the pendulum, disturbed the works of the clock, and broke
the piece of iron that regulates the striking.
