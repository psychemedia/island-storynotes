# Sandown History and Origins


## Sandown in the Early to mid-1800s

At the start of the 19th century, there was little to Sandown. A fort had been constructed there in the rein of Henry VIII, at the site of what is now Sandham gardens, and one or two summer villas had started to make an appearance.

*NEWPORT, Isle of Wight, Nov. 16.* The excessive rains that have of late prevailed in this Island are astonishing. That beautiful vale at the foot of St. Catherine's, which is bounded by the high lands on the right and left as far as Sandown, presents a melancholy prospect below Newchurch to the head of Brading harbour. Deluged with water, rich pastures exhibit at present more the appearance of sea than land; and his Majesty's fort of Sandown Castle is surrounded (excepting the high beach) with water, which gives it every appearance of an Island.

*Newport, Nov. 24.* The late heavy rains have laid all the low parts of this island under water, particularly from Newchurch to Brading Wall, that the fine of marshes of Sandown, &c. look more like the sea than pasturage lands. The small pox lately made its appearance in the village of Sandown, on which inoculation was immediately introduced, and we hear that all are in a favourable way. This salutary caution being taken in the first stage of the erruption we hope will prevent its spreading to any other part of the island.

Newport, March 6. On Thursday evening some persons found means to break into the storehouse, on Brading Quay, in which is deposited several pieces of excellent brandy (saved from the wreck at Sandown, some time ago). They succeeded fo far as get one piece of about 150 gallons out, and from circumstances it is supposed, that they meant have rolled it into the water, and towed it off, but the tide of ebb was too rapid in its retreat for them to accomplish it.—After making all fast, and to appearance the same as the store had not been broke open, they made an attempt to secret it, by digging a hole near the beach, but as it was not of a sufficient depth, it appeared above the ground, by which means the property was recovered. The perpetrators got off undiscovered, and as there is no suspicion who they are, perhaps it may remain a secret for ever, unless in the hour of dissipation, some one out of the number concerned, makes a discovery.

SANDOWN AND JOHN WILKES.

*To the Editor of the Isle of Wight County Press.*

Sir,—One of the charms of the Isle of Wight consists in the circumstance that within its contracted compass are found towns and villages, both old and new. In the very heart of the Island is the historic village of Carisbrooke, the former capital of the Island, with its written annals going so far back as the Venerable Bede and the Saxon Chronicle, where its name is mentioned, A.D. 530, and with its unwritten evidence of the more ancient occupation of the Romans stamped upon its still existing well-preserved "villa." At the back of the Island is the new, bright, cheerful, watering-place of Sandown. Rarely have we the opportunity of seeing the birth of a town; a town may extend in length, or breadth, or it may become the recipient of new municipal or electoral privileges, but there are few cases where we can assert that people still living saw the town start into being. Such is the case of Sandown. Canon Venables, in his guide, p. 161, has observed, "If the tourist examines the 'Ordnance Map' (dated 1810) he will observe no such place as 'Sandown' marked upon it. "Sandham Fort," "Sandham Cottage" (Wilkes's Villakin), and the barracks, are the only buildings indicated, while the site of the present town appears under the designation of "Royal Heath," then a common, as rough and uncultivated as "Pan Common" is now, overgrown with gorse, and feuding a few sheep on its scanty herbage." Even so lately as the date of Mr. James Thorne's publication ("The Land we Live in," vol. ii, p. 264) Sandown is described as a "little village, in which a neat church has been recently erected." "A few fishermen's huts," adds Thorne, "and humble cottages are dropped here and there along the cliffs, and two or three boats may generally be seen hauled on the beach. In the early morning, when the cliff's lie in deep shadow, or about sunset, when their sombre tints deepen into a richer hue, while two or three shrimpers are plying their craft, or a way-farer is wending along the sands to or from his day's labour, the scene has a quiet beauty that reminds one of the charming pictures which Collins used to paint so delightfully; not a few indeed of his paintings were taken from sketches made in this neighbourhood." All this has changed since the time when Collins painted his earlier pictures (1814-1836), and Sandown takes its place, if not with Newport and Ryde, yet with Cowes, Ventnor, and Shanklin, with its governing Board and powers Hof self-taxation for local purposes.

*Newport, Isle of Wight, June 5.*. On Thursday last arrived at Cowes, Mr. Chamberlain Wilkes, on his way to this town, and the delightful cottage he has taken near Sandown Fort. No situation can be more charming, as it commands the magnificent view of Culver Cliff, relieved by the wood and down of Yaverland to the east, and the heights of Shanklin to the west, with a fine bold shore of four miles; on the smooth land of which every diversion of riding, walking, or bathing may be enjoyed, under the protection of the stupendous cliff. The prospect of the sea is interminable ; and as ships and vessels of various description are continually passing, the eye is gratified with all the requisites which the painter would wish to groupe in his softer or grander compositions. Mr. Wilkes left the Island on Sanday last, and proposes to return with his accomplished daughter, the beginning of July, to take possession of this enchanting retreat, "fit haunt of the study and the muse."

ISLE OF WIGHT, Saturday, Oct. 17.

A short time since, the workmen employed in repairing the sea banks on the beach, in Sandown Bay, discovered the fossil remains of some very large animals, apparently of different species, which had probably been washed there and buried by the sea during some convulsion of nature, at a very remote period, as they were at a considerable depth below the surface of the present beach. Though perfectly changed into a kind of hard red gritstone, the forms of ribs, vertebrae, leg bones, teeth, &c. remain quite distinct and perfect. These curiosities of nature have been carefully preserved , and are now in the possession of John Smith, of Yaverlaad Farm.
