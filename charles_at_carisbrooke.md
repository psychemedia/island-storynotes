His Majesty, with an Heroick and unconquered patience, conquers his unmatchable afflictions, and with Christian constancy, expects a happy deliverance out of all his troubles. His greatest griefe is the calamity of his people, and Kingdomes, and His chiefest endeavours (on earth) is to settle them in Peace and happiness; for which end he is twice every day (with his meniall servants) upon his knees, in publique prayers to his God , besides his frequent, and pious Cogitations, and ejaculations; and it is not to be doubted but the prayers, and humble Petitions of His Majesty (with those of His loyall subjects) do ascend to the Throne of Grace, from whence (by the Almightyes mercy) strong and firme faith assures him of Peace, pardon, and the fruition of future happiness.

And for infallible Testimonies against all Ignorant, malicjous, detracting, mis-believing Heretiques, Schismatiques, and Sectaries to assure those Buzards of incredulity, that the Gracious, favourable, and preserving hand of God is with His Majesty, whereby he hath been a blessed instrument, (not onely in his former curing the griefe, or disease called the Evi!l) but since he came into this Island, He hath cured many, of whom so cured, there are 6 or 7 most remarkable, which I will relate as followeth.

1. At a Towne called *Winburne*, (or *Wimborne*) in *Dorcetshire*, there dwels an `[For testimony of the truth of this, there is one *John Newbery*, a Cloth-worker, who  dwels in Newport in the streete called Castle-Hold, this man did come over the water with her, and did see her lame, and cured.]` Ancient woman, the Wife to a Clothier, (whose name I could not know by, enquiry;) this Woman had a long time been so lame that she could not goe, and she hearing that the King was lodg'd in *Carisbrook* Castle in the Isle of *Wight*, she was perswaded in her minde that His Majesty could cure her, in which beliefe she made towards the Island, and with horse or Cart, or both, or otherwaies, she was brougbt to Hurst Castle in *Hampshire* by land, from whence she was carried into a Boat in mens armes, which Boat brought her to *Newport*, from whence she was carried a mile to *Carisbrook*, where His Majesty did touch her, and her lameness ceased in three dayes space, so that with thanks to God, and prayers for the King, she departed from the Island, and went home 20 miles on foot. This was before the Treaty began, much about the midst of August last.

2. Mistresse *Elizabeth Stevens* of *Durley* in *Hampshire*, came from her home to *Winchester*, and from thence to the Island to His Majesty to be cured of the evill, whereof she had been blinde of one Eye 16. daies and could not open her Eye by any meanes, and after the King had touched her, her Eye opened and she saw immediatly, with a clear and perfect sight. This was about the seventh of October.

3. *Elizabeth Gage* of *Southampton* (being of 3 yeares of age) was exceedingly lame, and in great paine, she came to his Majesty, and he touched her, whereby (through Gods blessing) she was presently cured.

4. *Joane Mathewes*, aged 15. yeares, a Braziers Danghter one *William Mathews*, dwelling in Newport in the Isle of Wight, she bad been long time painefully lame, and had been at the *Bathe*, and used many medicines in vaine; she came to the King on Thursday the 19. of October, He toucht her, and she had present ease, and every day shee goes better than any other: myselfe saw her and spaje with her, and I left her able to go reasonable well.

5. A souldier in *Calshot Castle* in Hampshire, had 2. sore issues in his thighes, to which he did frequently apply ointment which eased him, but cured him not: This man went to the Island to His Majesty, who did touch him, and he did after that use his former medicines, which were wont to give him ease, but then the said application did most grievously vex and torment him; so that he was perswaded to forbeare to use the said oyles, Emplasters, and Unguents, and then he was suddenly cared.

6. Mistress *Elizebeth Paine* of *Bristoll* was blinde, and such a Rhewmatick defluxion did dayly fall from her eyes, which did wet two or three large hancherchiefes every day; she came te the King on Sunday last, the 5. of this November, His Majesty did touch her eyes, the Rhewme ceased, so that she went away presently with a cleere and perfect sight; and two houres after she came to the King againe, and gave him thanks upon her knees; His Majesty bade her give thanks to God; so she with giving God praise, and prayers for the King, went from the Island to *Bristoll* with exceeding joy for her recovery.

7. *Margaret Heyden*, aged 73. yeares, dwelling in *Newport* in *Chayne* lane, was not able to stir but as she was lifted from bed to chaire, and from chaire to bed , touched by His Majesty, and cured, so that with one crutch she did goe about her house, and drew 5 or 6. pots of Ale for me, and my company.

These things (me thinkes) should move the mindes of some unmannerly Levellers to esteeme his Majesty as one that is not to be ranked or filed with common men.
