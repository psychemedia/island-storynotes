# Demeter and Persephone — Reworked from the Homeric Hymn

In the town of Eleusis, there was much to rejoice in the household of Lord Celeus, a well-regarded leader of that place, for his wife, Metanira, though thought to be past child bearing age, had given birth. To a son. But there was concern too, because the child that was born was born weak.

One day. Metanira's three daughters went down to the well to fetch water for their mother.

When they reached the well, they saw an old woman sitting their, beside it, beneath the spreading branches of an old olive tree.

They politely asked who she was, where she had come from, where she might be going.

"Doso is my name" she said, her voice carrying with it much weariness, much sadness. "I was captured in Crete, by pirates, and brought to this land. We made camp on the shore, to cook, then we would sail again to where I would be sold in slavery. But I escaped. And I fled. And now I am here, under this tree, beside this well. And if anyone could give me work that befits my age — keeping a household, teaching other women, even nursing a child — I would do it gladly, and the Gods of Olympus would surely look favourably upon anyone who employed me so."

Having filled their jugs from the well, the three daughters returned home, where they told their mother Doso's sad tale and she bade them to fetch the old woman, so she could help nurse Metanira's child.

The girls went back to the well and returned with Doso, although a great sorrow seemed to weight upon as she followd on behind.

Doso entered the house, her dark cloak covering her head, but as she stood in the doorway it seemed to Metanira that Doso's head reached up to the roof, and Metanira felt a sense of awe an wonder that she could not explain.

Doso sat down, her eyes downcast, saying nothing, unsmiling, refusing both food and drink.

Iambe, one of Metanira's daughters, tried to cheer up their guest, joking, laughing, offering her red wine.

"Just a little barley, mixed with water, and mint" she said, and that was all she would accept.

Metanira watched closely. "I can see you are of noble birth, by your grace, by your dignity", she said. "Please nurse my child. We will repay you howsoever we can, and if you can bring him to his youth, your reward will be the envy of many."

Doso looked at Metanira, thanked here, and said she would surely help the child, that she knew many charms that would protect him. "And the Gods will surely reward you too."

Doso then took the boy, and she nursed him, but she did not give him milk. Instead she fed him ambrosia, the nectar of the Gods. And he grew strong, and healthy, and he grew quickly.

But this was not the only magic that Doso worked on the child.

One night, Metanira thought to see her child, but as she did so, she saw Doso pick up the boy, as she did every night, walk over to the fire, as she did very night, and then hold the boy over the flames..

"Stop!" shouted Metanira, "what are you doing, what are you doing to my child?" Full of fear, full of panic, fearing for the safety of her son, as any mother would.

Doso turned, surprised. She glared at Metanira, took that boy, the biy who had grown stronger and faster than every other mortal child before him, the boy who had grown quite remarkably, and threw him to the ground.
