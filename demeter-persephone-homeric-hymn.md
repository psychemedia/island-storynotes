# Demeter and Persephone — Reworked from the Homeric Hymn


In three??? parts...

## Part I — Doso

In the town of Eleusis, there was much to rejoice in the household of Lord Celeus, a well-regarded leader of that place, for his wife, Metanira, though thought to be past child bearing age, had given birth. To a son. But there was concern too, because the child that was born was born weak.

One day. Metanira's three daughters went down to the well to fetch water for their mother.

When they reached the well, they saw an old woman sitting their, beside it, beneath the spreading branches of an old olive tree.

They politely asked who she was, where she had come from, where she might be going.

"Doso is my name" she said, her voice carrying with it much weariness, much sadness. "I was captured in Crete, by pirates, and brought to this land. We made camp on the shore, to cook, then we would sail again to where I would be sold in slavery. But I escaped. And I fled. And now I am here, under this tree, beside this well. And if anyone could give me work that befits my age — keeping a household, teaching other women, even nursing a child — I would do it gladly, and the Gods of Olympus would surely look favourably upon anyone who employed me so."

Having filled their jugs from the well, the three daughters returned home, where they told their mother Doso's sad tale and she bade them to fetch the old woman, so she could help nurse Metanira's child.

The girls went back to the well and returned with Doso, although a great sorrow seemed to weight upon as she followd on behind.

Doso entered the house, her dark cloak covering her head, but as she stood in the doorway it seemed to Metanira that Doso's head reached up to the roof, and Metanira felt a sense of awe an wonder that she could not explain.

Doso sat down, her eyes downcast, saying nothing, unsmiling, refusing both food and drink.

One of Metanira's daughters, tried to cheer up their guest, joking, laughing, offering her red wine.

"Just a little barley, mixed with water, and mint" she said, and that was all she would accept.

Metanira watched closely. "I can see you are of noble birth, by your grace, by your dignity", she said. "Please nurse my child. We will repay you howsoever we can, and if you can bring him to his youth, your reward will be the envy of many."

Doso looked at Metanira, thanked here, and said she would surely help the child, that she knew many charms that would protect him. "And the Gods will surely reward you too."

Doso then took the boy, and she nursed him, but she did not give him milk. Instead she fed him ambrosia, the nectar of the Gods. And he grew strong, and healthy, and he grew quickly.

But this was not the only magic that Doso worked on the child.

One night, Metanira thought to see her child, but as she did so, she saw Doso pick up the boy, as she did every night, walk over to the fire, as she did very night, and then hold the boy over the flames..

"Stop!" shouted Metanira, "what are you doing, what are you doing to my child?" Full of fear, full of panic, fearing for the safety of her son, as any mother would.

Doso turned, surprised. She glared at Metanira, took that boy, the biy who had grown stronger and faster than every other mortal child before him, the boy who had grown quite remarkably, and threw him to the ground.

"What have I done? What have you done?"

And as Metanira watched, Doso, the old woman, transformed before her very eyes, the years of age fell from her face and she glowed as if with some divine light. 

"Don't you realise? Can't you see? I would have made your son deathless. But now? Now, there is no way he will avoid the death that is suffered by every man. And though he will be honoured, strife and war will plague the sons of Eleusis ever more."

And as she spoke, a beautiful scent filled the air.

"Do you not realise who I am? I am Demeter. Goddess of the harvest, the greatest help and source of joy to the undying Gods and to mortal men."

"Now go. Go and build me a temple. And I will teach you the rites by which you shall worship me so that you may win the favour of my heart."

By this time, Metanira's daughters, woken by the commotion, had come to see what the trouble was. One of them picked up her young brother, and tried to comfort him, but she did not have the skill that Doso — that Demeter — had had.

After a night spent quaking with fear, they told Celeus the next morning what had happened the night before, of how the Goddess Demeter had revealed herself to them, and what they must now do: they must build a temple to her.

And so they did as they must.

But rather than repay the gifts and the offerings of the Eleusinians with a bountiful harvest, the sorrow that Doso had carried as she sat as an old woman at the well, the anger that had remained hidden, was now released with a cold and hostile fury that prevented the spring from coming, that caused the harvest to fail, and caused all to suffer famine.

Rather than acting as the Goddess of Harvest, she became as if a Goddess of Death.

And that is the end of Doso's tale.

## Part II — 

One day, as Zeus, the King of the Gods, was sitting on Mount Olympus, who should he notice coming up the mountainside but Hades, his younger brother, Hades, ruler of the lower of the three realms, Hades, who rarely came up from the underworld that was his kingdom.

At one point, Hades stopped, and appeared to be watching something, or some one. Ah... some of the younger Goddesses, and some of the nymphs too... Hera, Zeus wife, would often see him watching them too, and more, and she did not approve.

But Hades was a bachelor, and "who's she?" Hades pointed? "She's beautiful..."

"Which one? That one? Or, oh, that one. That's Persephone. Your niece. Our sister's daughter. Come to think of it, my daughter, too. Well, one of them, at least."

In those days, for the Gods, well... there weren't that many Gods and Goddesses around that you could start a family with.

"She's lovely...."

They talked. They plotted. They planned.

Persephone's mother wouldn't approve, of course. So they;d best keep it secret, at last until Persephone was Hades wife.

The plan was made.

The plan was simple...

One day, when Persephone was out with the other goddesses and nymphs, Zeus would make sure that Persephone was separated from the others, he could guarantee she'd be tempted away by a path of beautiful flowers she could pick: irises, and hyacinths, and narcissus, yes, narcissus, she would surely want to pick Narcissus; and then...

A chasm appeared, and from it rode Hades, pulled on a golden chariot from the underworld by his undying horses. He grabbed Persephone, turned the horses around, and return with his unwilling bride to the underworld.

Persephone screamed, seeing the earth, the sky, all she knew of loved disappearing behind her. Screamed to those she had just been with. Screamed to her father. Screamed for her mother.

The chasm closed. And Persephone had gone.

That first scream? Persephone was was already too far away for her friends to hear it.

That second scream, to her father: Zeus had got his plausible deniability excuse in place. He was in the Temple, accepting sacrifices to him.

That third and final scream? Persephone's mother may not have heard it, but she felt, she knew as mother's often do that there was something troubling her daughter, some danger she was in, and she went to look for her.

But there was no sign of her.

For nine days, she sought her daughter. For nine days, there was no sign of her.

But then, on the tenth day, Hecate, Goddess of the Moon, Hecate, who straddles the liminal space between the three worlds, she told Persephone's mother that she too had heard the screams.

And together they went to see Helios, the Sun God who sees all that happens during the day.

And Helios, seeing the deep despair of Persephone's mother, took pity on her, and told her what he knew, as I have told you: that Zeus had given Persephone to his brother, that Hades had seized her, had forced her into his chariot, had taken her screaming, down to the underworld to be his wife.

"But he's not that bad, really," said Helios. "He does love her, and will surely treat her well. And he is the lord over one of the three realms, so quite a catch, really..."

But this did not placate Persephone's mother at all. And even though she was a Goddess herself, and a sister to Zeus, she took herself far away from Olympus, to Eleusis, where she took the form of an old woman sat down by a well, under an old olive tree.
